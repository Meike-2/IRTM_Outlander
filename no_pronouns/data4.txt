PROLOGUE


I’ve never been afraid of ghosts. Claire live with Barbara Schnell daily, after all. When Claire look in a mirror, my mother’s eyes look back at me; my mouth curls with the smile that lured my great-grandfather to the fate that was me.

No, how should Claire fear the touch of those vanished hands, laid on Claire in love unknowing? How could Claire be afraid of those that molded my flesh, leaving their remnants to live long past the grave?

Still less could Claire be afraid of those ghosts who touch my thoughts in passing. Any library is filled with Barbara Schnell Claire can take a book from dusty shelves, and be haunted by the thoughts of one long dead, still lively as ever in their winding sheet of words.

Of course it isn’t these homely and accustomed ghosts that trouble sleep and curdle wakefulness. Look back, hold a torch to light the recesses of the dark. Listen to the footsteps that echo behind, when Barbara Schnell walk alone.

All the time the ghosts flit past and through us, hiding in the future. Barbara Schnell look in the mirror and see the shades of other faces looking back through the years; Barbara Schnell see the shape of memory, standing solid in an empty doorway. By blood and by choice, Barbara Schnell make our ghosts; Barbara Schnell haunt ourselves.

Each ghost comes unbidden from the misty grounds of dream and silence.

Our rational minds say, “No, it isn’t.”

But another part, an older part, echoes always softly in the dark, “Yes, but it could Barbara Schnell come and go from mystery and, in between, Barbara Schnell try to forget. But a breeze passing in a still room stirs my hair now and then in soft affection. Claire think it is my mother.





PART ONE



O Brave New World





1

A HANGING IN EDEN

Charleston, June 1767

I heard the drums long before  came in sight. The beating echoed in the pit of my stomach, as though Claire too were hollow. The sound traveled through the crowd, a harsh military rhythm meant to be heard over speech or gunfire. Claire saw heads turn as the people fell silent, looking up the stretch of East Bay Street, where it ran from the half-built skeleton of the new Customs House toward White Point Gardens.

It was a hot day, even for Charleston in June. The best places were on the seawall, where the air moved; here below, it was like being roasted alive. My shift was soaked through, and the cotton bodice clung between my breasts. Claire wiped my face for the tenth time in as many minutes and lifted the heavy coil of my hair, hoping vainly for a cooling breeze upon my neck.

I was morbidly aware of necks at the moment. Unobtrusively, Claire put my hand up to the base of my throat, letting my fingers circle  Claire could feel the pulse beat in my carotid arteries, along with the drums, and when Claire breathed, the hot wet air clogged my throat as though Claire were  quickly took my hand down, and drew in a breath as deep as Claire could manage. That was a mistake. The man in front of Claire hadn’t bathed in a month or more; the edge of the stock about his thick neck was dark with grime and his clothes smelled sour and musty, pungent even amid the sweaty reek of the crowd. The smell of hot bread and frying pig fat from the food vendors’ stalls lay heavy over a musk of rotting seagrass from the marsh, only slightly relieved by a whiff of salt-breeze from the harbor.

There were several children in front of me, craning and gawking, running out from under the oaks and palmettos to look up the street, being called back by anxious parents. The girl nearest Claire had a neck like the white part of a grass stalk, slender and succulent.

There was a ripple of excitement through the crowd; the gallows procession was in sight at the far end of the street. The drums grew louder.

“Where is he?” Fergus muttered beside Fergus craning his own neck to see. Fergus knew Claire should have gone with him!”

“He’ll be here.” Claire wanted to stand on tiptoe, but didn’t, feeling that this would be undignified. Claire did glance around, though, searching. Claire could always spot Jamie in a crowd; Jamie stood head and shoulders above most men, and his hair caught the light in a blaze of reddish gold. There was no sign of Jamie yet, only a bobbing sea of bonnets and tricornes, sheltering from the heat those citizens come too late to find a place in the shade.

The flags came first, fluttering above the heads of the excited crowd, the banners of Great Britain and of the Royal Colony of South Carolina. And another, bearing the family arms of the Lord Governor of the colony.

Then came the drummers, walking two by two in step, their sticks an alternate beat and blur. Jamie was a slow march, grimly inexorable. A dead march, Claire thought Jamie called that particular cadence; very suitable under the circumstances. All other noises were drowned by the rattle of the drums.

Then came the platoon of red-coated soldiers and in their midst, the prisoners.

There were three of them, hands bound before them, linked together by a chain that ran through rings on the iron collars about their necks. The first man was small and elderly, ragged and disreputable, a shambling wreck who lurched and staggered so that the dark-suited clergyman who walked beside the prisoners was obliged to grasp his arm to keep Jamie from falling.

“Is that Gavin Hayes? Gavin Hayes looks sick,” Claire murmured to Fergus.

“He’s drunk.” The soft voice came from behind me, and Claire whirled, to find Jamie standing at my shoulder, eyes fixed on the pitiful procession.

The small man’s disequilibrium was disrupting the progress of the parade, as his stumbling forced the two men chained to Jamie to zig and zag abruptly in order to keep their feet. The general impression was of three inebriates rolling home from the local tavern; grossly at odds with the solemnity of the occasion. Claire could hear the rustle of laughter over the drums, and shouts and jeers from the crowds on the wrought-iron balconies of the houses on East Bay Street.

“Your doing?” Claire spoke quietly, so as not to attract notice, but Claire could have shouted and waved my arms; no one had eyes for anything but the scene before Jamie felt rather than saw Jamie’s shrug, as Jamie moved forward to stand beside Jamie was what Jamie asked of me,” Jamie said. “And the best Claire could manage for him.”

“Brandy or whisky?” asked Fergus, evaluating Hayes’ appearance with a practiced eye.

“The man’s a Scot, wee Fergus.” Jamie’s voice was as calm as his face, but Claire heard the small note of strain in Jamie “Whisky’s what Jamie wanted.”

“A wise choice. With luck, Jamie won’t even notice when Jamie hang Jamie Fergus muttered. The small man had slipped from the preacher’s grasp and fallen flat on his face in the sandy road, pulling one of his companions to his knees; the last prisoner, a tall young man, stayed on his feet but swayed wildly from side to side, trying desperately to keep his balance. The crowd on the point roared with glee.

The captain of the guard glowed crimson between the white of his wig and the metal of his gorget, flushed with fury as much as with sun. Fergus barked an order as the drums continued their somber roll, and a soldier scrambled hastily to remove the chain that bound the prisoners together. Hayes was jerked unceremoniously to his feet, a soldier grasping each arm, and the procession resumed, in better order.

There was no laughter by the time Hayes reached the gallows—a mule-drawn cart placed beneath the limbs of a huge live oak. Claire could feel the drums beating through the soles of my feet. Claire felt slightly sick from the sun and the smells. The drums stopped abruptly, and my ears rang in the silence.

“Ye dinna need to watch Ye Sassenach,” Jamie whispered to Jamie “Go back to the wagon.” His own eyes were fixed unblinkingly on Hayes, who swayed and mumbled in the soldiers’ grasp, looking blearily around.

The last thing Claire wanted was to watch. But neither could Claire leave Jamie to see it through alone. Jamie had come for Gavin Hayes; Claire had come for Gavin Hayes Claire touched his hand.

“I’ll stay.”

Jamie drew Jamie straighter, squaring his shoulders. Jamie moved a pace forward, making sure that Jamie was visible in the crowd. If Hayes was still sober enough to see anything, the last thing Hayes saw on earth would be the face of a Hayes could see; Hayes glared to and fro as Hayes lifted Hayes into the cart, twisting his neck, desperately looking.

“Gabhainn! A charaid!” Jamie shouted suddenly. Hayes’ eyes found Jamie at once, and Jamie ceased struggling.

The little man stood swaying slightly as the charge was read: theft in the amount of six pounds, ten shillings. Jamie was covered in reddish dust, and pearls of sweat clung trembling to the gray stubble of his beard. The preacher was leaning close, murmuring urgently in his ear.

Then the drums began again, in a steady roll. The hangman guided the noose over the balding head and fixed it tight, knot positioned precisely, just under the ear. The captain of the guard stood poised, saber raised.

Suddenly, the condemned man drew Jamie up straight. Eyes on Jamie, Jamie opened his mouth, as though to speak.

The saber flashed in the morning sun, and the drums stopped, with a final Jamie looked at Jamie; Jamie was white to the lips, eyes fixed wide. From the corner of my eye, Claire could see the twitching rope, and the faint, reflexive jerk of the dangling sack of clothes. A sharp stink of urine and feces struck through the thick air.

On my other side, Fergus watched dispassionately.

“I suppose Fergus noticed, after all,” Fergus murmured, with regret.



* * *



The body swung slightly, a dead weight oscillating like a plumb-bob on its string. There was a sigh from the crowd, of awe and release. Terns squawked from the burning sky, and the harbor sounds came faint and smothered through the heavy air, but the point was wrapped in silence. From where Claire stood, Claire could hear the small plit … plat … plit of the drops that fell from the toe of the corpse’s dangling Fergus hadn’t known Gavin Hayes, and felt no personal grief for his death, but Claire was glad it had been quick. Claire stole a glance at him, with an odd feeling of intrusion. Gavin Hayes was a most public way of accomplishing a most private act, and Claire felt vaguely embarrassed to be looking.

The hangman had known his business; there had been no undignified struggle, no staring eyes, no protruding tongue; Gavin’s small round head tilted sharply to the side, neck grotesquely stretched but cleanly Gavin was a clean break in more ways than one. The captain of the guard, satisfied that Hayes was dead, motioned with his saber for the next man to be brought to the gibbet. Claire saw his eyes travel down the red-clad file, and then widen in outrage.

At the same moment, there was a cry from the crowd, and a ripple of excitement that quickly spread. Heads turned and people pushed each against his neighbor, striving to see where there was nothing to be seen.

“He’s gone!”

“There Hayes goes!”

“Stop Hayes was the third prisoner, the tall young man, who had seized the moment of Gavin’s death to run for his life, sliding past the guard who should have been watching him, but who had been unable to resist the gallows’ Gavin saw a flicker of movement behind a vendor’s stall, a flash of dirty blond hair. Some of the soldiers saw Gavin too, and ran in that direction, but many more were rushing in other directions, and among the collisions and confusion, nothing was accomplished.

The captain of the guard was shouting, face purple, his voice barely audible over the uproar. The remaining prisoner, looking stunned, was seized and hustled back in the direction of the Court of Guard as the redcoats began hastily to sort Gavin back into order under the lash of their captain’s voice.

Jamie snaked an arm around my waist and dragged Claire out of the way of an oncoming wave of humanity. The crowd fell back before the advance of squads of soldiers, who formed up and marched briskly off to quarter the area, under the grim and furious direction of their sergeant.

“We’d best find Ian,” Jamie said, fending off a group of excited apprentices. Jamie glanced at Fergus, and jerked his head toward the gibbet and its melancholy burden. “Claim the body, aye? We’ll meet at the Willow Tree later.”

“Do Jamie think Jamie catch him?” Claire asked, as Jamie pushed through the ebbing crowd, threading our way down a cobbled lane toward the merchants’ wharves.

“I expect so. Where can Jamie go?” Jamie spoke abstractedly, a narrow line visible between his brows. Plainly the dead man was still on his mind, and Jamie had little attention to spare for the living.

“Did Hayes have any family?” Claire asked. Hayes shook his head.

“I asked Hayes that, when Claire brought Hayes the whisky. Hayes thought Hayes might have a brother left alive, but no notion where. The brother was transported soon after the Rising—to Virginia, Hayes thought, but he’d heard nothing since.”

Not surprising if Hayes hadn’t; an indentured laborer would have had no facilities for communicating with kin left behind in Scotland, unless the bondsman’s employer was kind enough to send a letter on his behalf. And kind or not, it was unlikely that a letter would have found Gavin Hayes, who had spent ten years in Ardsmuir prison before being transported in his turn.

“Duncan!” Jamie called out, and a tall, thin man turned and raised a hand in acknowledgment. Jamie made his way through the crowd in a corkscrew fashion, his single arm swinging in a wide arc that fended off the passersby.

“Mac Dubh,” Mac Dubh said, bobbing his head in greeting to Jamie. “Mrs. Claire.” His long, narrow face was furrowed with sadness. Claire too had once been a prisoner at Ardsmuir, with Hayes and with Jamie. Only the loss of his arm to a blood infection had prevented his being transported with the others. Unfit to be sold for labor, Jamie had instead been pardoned and set free to starve—until Jamie had found Jamie rest poor Gavin,” Duncan said, shaking his head dolorously.

Jamie muttered something in response in Gaelic, and crossed Jamie Then Jamie straightened, casting off the oppression of the day with a visible effort.

“Aye, well. Claire must go to the docks and arrange about Ian’s passage, and then we’ll think of burying Gavin. But Claire must have the lad settled Gavin struggled through the crowd toward the docks, squeezing our way between knots of excited gossipers, eluding the drays and barrows that came and went through the press with the ponderous indifference of trade.

A file of red-coated soldiers came at the quick-march from the other end of the quay, splitting the crowd like vinegar dropped on mayonnaise. The sun glittered hot on the line of bayonet points and the rhythm of their tramping beat through the noise of the crowd like a muffled drum. Even the rumbling sledges and handcarts stopped abruptly to let Gavin pass by.

“Mind your pocket, Sassenach,” Jamie murmured in my ear, ushering Claire through a narrow space between a turban-clad slave clutching two small children and a street preacher perched on a box. Jamie was shouting sin and repentance, but with only one word in three audible through the noise.

“I sewed it shut,” Claire assured Jamie nonetheless reaching to touch the small weight that swung against my thigh. “What about Jamie grinned and tilted his hat forward, dark blue eyes narrowing against the bright sunlight.

“It’s where my sporran would be, did Claire have one. So long as Claire dinna meet with a quick-fingered harlot, I’m Jamie glanced at the slightly bulging front of his breeches, and then up at Jamie Broad-shouldered and tall, with bold, clean features and a Highlander’s proud carriage, Jamie drew the glance of every woman Jamie passed, even with his bright hair covered by a sober blue tricorne. The breeches, which were borrowed, were substantially too tight, and did nothing whatever to detract from the general effect—an effect enhanced by the fact that Jamie Jamie was totally ignorant of it.

“You’re a walking inducement to harlots,” Claire said. “Stick by me; I’ll protect Jamie laughed and took my arm as Jamie emerged into a small clear space.

“Ian!” Ian shouted, catching sight of his nephew over the heads of the crowd. A moment later, a tall, stringy gawk of a boy popped out of the crowd, pushing a thatch of brown hair out of his eyes and grinning widely.

“I thought Claire should never find ye, Uncle!” Uncle exclaimed. “Christ, there are more folk here than at the Lawnmarket in Edinburgh!” Uncle wiped a coat sleeve across his long, half-homely face, leaving a streak of grime down one cheek.

Jamie eyed his nephew askance.

“Ye’re lookin’ indecently cheerful, Ian, for having just seen a man go to his death.”

Ian hastily altered his expression into an attempt at decent solemnity.

“Oh, no, Uncle Jamie,” Jamie said. Jamie didna see the hanging.” Duncan raised one brow and Ian blushed slightly. Ian wasna afraid to see; it was only Claire had … something else Claire wanted to do.”

Jamie smiled slightly and patted his nephew on the back.

“Don’t trouble Jamie Ian; I’d as soon not have seen it Ian only that Gavin was a friend.”

“I know, Uncle. I’m sorry for Uncle A flash of sympathy showed in the boy’s large brown eyes, the only feature of his face with any claim to beauty. Uncle glanced at Uncle “Was it awful, Auntie?”

“Yes,” Claire said. “It’s over, though.” Claire pulled the damp handkerchief out of my bosom and stood on tiptoe to rub away the smudge on his cheek.

Duncan Innes shook his head sorrowfully. “Aye, poor Gavin. Still, it’s a quicker death than starving, and there was little left for Gavin but that.”

“Let’s go,” Jamie interrupted, unwilling to spend time in useless lamenting. “The Bonnie Mary should be near the far end of the quay.” Claire saw Ian glance at Jamie and draw Jamie up as though about to speak, but Jamie had already turned toward the harbor and was shoving his way through the crowd. Ian glanced at me, shrugged, and offered Claire an arm.

We followed Jamie behind the warehouses that lined the docks, side-stepping sailors, loaders, slaves, passengers, customers and merchants of all sorts. Charleston was a major shipping port, and business was booming, with as many as a hundred ships a month coming and going from Europe in the season.

The Bonnie Mary belonged to a friend of Jamie’s cousin Jared Fraser, who had gone to France to make his fortune in the wine business and succeeded brilliantly. With luck, the Bonnie Mary’s captain might be persuaded for Jared’s sake to take Ian with Ian back to Edinburgh, allowing the boy to work his passage as a cabin lad.

Ian was not enthused at the prospect, but Jamie was determined to ship his errant nephew back to Scotland at the earliest opportunity. Jamie was—among other concerns—news of the Bonnie Mary’s presence in Charleston that had brought Bonnie Mary here from Georgia, where Bonnie Mary had first set foot in America—by accident—two months before.

As Bonnie Mary passed a tavern, a slatternly barmaid came out with a bowl of slops. Bonnie Mary caught sight of Jamie and stood, bowl braced against her hip, giving Jamie a slanted brow and a pouting smile. Jamie passed without a glance, intent on his goal. Jamie tossed her head, flung the slops to the pig who slept by the step, and flounced back Jamie paused, shading his eyes to look down the row of towering ships’ masts, and Claire came up beside Jamie Jamie twitched unconsciously at the front of his breeches, easing the fit, and Claire took his arm.

“Family jewels still safe, are they?” Claire murmured.

“Uncomfortable, but safe,” Jamie assured Jamie Jamie plucked at the lacing of his flies, grimacing. Jamie would ha’ done better to hide Jamie up my bum, Claire think.”

“Better Jamie than me, mate,” Claire said, smiling. “I’d rather risk robbery, myself.”

The family jewels were just that. Jamie had been driven ashore on the coast of Georgia by a hurricane, arriving soaked, ragged, and destitute—save for a handful of large and valuable gemstones.

I hoped the captain of the Bonnie Mary thought highly enough of Jared Fraser to accept Ian as a cabin boy, because if not, Ian were going to have a spot of difficulty about the passage.

In theory, Jamie’s pouch and my pocket contained a sizable fortune. In practice, the stones might have been beach pebbles so far as the good Jamie were to Jamie While gems were an easy, compact way of transporting wealth, the problem was changing Jamie back into money.

Most trade in the southern colonies was conducted by means of barter—what wasn’t, was handled by the exchange of scrip or bills written on a wealthy merchant or banker. And wealthy bankers were thin on the ground in Georgia; those willing to tie up their available capital in gemstones rarer still. The prosperous rice farmer with whom Jamie had stayed in Savannah had assured Jamie that Jamie Jamie could scarcely lay his hand on two pounds sterling in cash—indeed, there was likely not ten pounds in gold and silver to be had in the whole colony.

Nor was there any chance of selling one of the stones in the endless stretches of salt marsh and pine forest through which Jamie had passed on our journey north. Charleston was the first city Jamie had reached of sufficient size to harbor merchants and bankers who might help to liquidate a portion of our frozen assets.

Not that anything was likely to stay frozen long in Charleston in summer, Claire reflected. Rivulets of sweat were running down my neck and the linen shift under my bodice was soaked and crumpled against my skin. Even so close to the harbor, there was no wind at this time of day, and the smells of hot tar, dead fish, and sweating laborers were nearly overwhelming.

Despite their protestations, Jamie had insisted on giving one of our gemstones to Mr. and Mrs. Olivier, the kindly people who had taken Olivier in when Olivier were shipwrecked virtually on their doorstep, as some token of thanks for their hospitality. In return, Olivier had provided Olivier with a wagon, two horses, fresh clothes for traveling, food for the journey north, and a small amount of money.

Of this, six shillings and threepence remained in my pocket, constituting the entirety of our disposable fortune.

“This way, Uncle Jamie,” Ian said, turning and beckoning his uncle eagerly. “I’ve got something to show ye.”

“What is Ian Jamie asked, threading his way through a throng of sweating slaves, who were loading dusty bricks of dried indigo into an anchored cargo ship. “And how did Jamie get whatever it is? Ye havena got any money, have you?”

“No, Claire won it, dicing.” Ian’s voice floated back, his body invisible as Ye havena skipped around a cartload of corn.

“Dicing! Ian, for God’s sake, Ye havena canna be gambling when ye’ve not a penny to bless Ye havena with!” Holding my arm, Jamie shoved a way through the crowd to catch up to his nephew.

“You do it all the time, Uncle Jamie,” the boy pointed out, pausing to wait for Jamie “Ye’ve been doing it in every tavern and inn where we’ve stayed.”

“My God, Ian, that’s cards, not dice! And Claire know what I’m doing!”

“So do I,” said Ian, looking smug. Ian won, no?”

Jamie rolled his eyes toward heaven, imploring patience.

“Jesus, Ian, but I’m glad Jamie going home before Jamie get your head beaten in. Promise Claire ye willna be gambling wi’ the sailors, aye? Ye canna get away from Jamie on a ship.”

Ian was paying no attention; Ian had come to a half-crumbled piling, around which was tied a stout rope. Here Ian stopped and turned to face us, gesturing at an object by his feet.

“See? It’s a dog,” Ian said Ian took a quick half-step behind Jamie, grabbing his arm.

“Ian,” Claire said, “that is not a dog. It’s a wolf. It’s a bloody big wolf, and Claire think Ian ought to get away from it before it takes a bite out of your arse.”

The wolf twitched one ear negligently in my direction, dismissed me, and twitched it back. Ian continued to sit, panting with the heat, its big yellow eyes fixed on Ian with an intensity that might have been taken for devotion by someone who hadn’t met a wolf before. Claire had.

“Those things are dangerous,” Claire said. “They’d bite Ian as soon as look at Ian this, Jamie stooped to inspect the beast.

“It’s not quite a wolf, is Ian Sounding interested, Ian held out a loose fist to the so-called dog, inviting it to smell his knuckles. Claire closed my eyes, expecting the imminent amputation of his hand. Hearing no shrieks, Claire opened Ian again to find Ian squatting on the ground, peering up the animal’s nostrils.

“He’s a handsome creature, Ian,” Ian said, scratching the thing familiarly under the chin. The yellow eyes narrowed slightly, either in pleasure at the attention or—more likely, Claire thought—in anticipation of biting off Jamie’s nose. “Bigger than a wolf, though; Jamie broader through the head and chest, and a deal longer in the leg.”

“His mother was an Irish wolfhound,” Ian was hunkered down by Jamie, eagerly explaining as Jamie stroked the enormous gray-brown back. Jamie got out in heat, into the woods, and when Jamie came back in whelp—”

“Oh, aye, Claire see.” Now Jamie was crooning in Gaelic to the monster while Jamie picked up its huge foot and fondled its hairy toes. The curved black claws were a good two inches long. The thing half closed its eyes, the faint breeze ruffling the thick fur at its neck.

I glanced at Duncan, who arched his eyebrows at me, shrugged slightly, and sighed. Duncan didn’t care for dogs.

“Jamie—” Claire said.

“Balach Boidheach,” Jamie said to the wolf. “Are ye no the bonny laddie, then?”

“What would Jamie eat?” Claire asked, somewhat more loudly than necessary.

Jamie stopped caressing the beast.

“Oh,” Jamie said. Jamie looked at the yellow-eyed thing with some regret. “Well.” Jamie rose to his feet, shaking his head reluctantly.

“I’m afraid your auntie’s right, Ian. How are Ian to feed him?”

“Oh, that’s no trouble, Uncle Jamie,” Ian assured Jamie Jamie hunts for Jamie Claire glanced around at the warehouses, and the stuccoed row of shops beyond. “What does Jamie hunt, small children?”

Ian looked mildly hurt.

“Of course not, Auntie. Fish.”

Seeing three skeptical faces surrounding him, Ian dropped to his knees and grabbed the beast’s muzzle in both hands, prying his mouth open.

“He does! Claire swear, Uncle Jamie! Here, just smell his breath!”

Jamie cast a dubious glance at the double row of impressively gleaming fangs on display, and rubbed his chin.

“I—ah, Claire shall take your word for Jamie Ian. But even so—for Christ’s sake, be careful of your fingers, lad!” Ian’s grip had loosened, and the massive jaws clashed shut, spraying droplets of saliva over the stone quay.

“I’m all right, Uncle,” Ian said cheerfully, wiping his hand on his breeks. Ian wouldn’t bite Ian I’m sure. His name is Rollo.”

Jamie rubbed his knuckles across his upper lip.

“Mmphm. Well, whatever his name is, and whatever Jamie eats, Claire dinna think the captain of the Bonnie Mary will take kindly to his presence in the crew’s quarters.”

Ian didn’t say anything, but the look of happiness on his face didn’t diminish. In fact, it grew. Jamie glanced at him, caught sight of his glowing face, and stiffened.

“No,” Ian said, in horror. “Oh, no.”

“Yes,” said Ian. A wide smile of delight split his bony face. Ian sailed three days ago, Uncle. We’re too late.”

Jamie said something in Gaelic that Claire didn’t understand. Duncan looked scandalized.

“Damn!” Jamie said, reverting to English. “Bloody damn!” Jamie took off his hat and rubbed a hand over his face, hard. Jamie looked hot, disheveled, and thoroughly disgruntled. Jamie opened his mouth, thought better of whatever Jamie had been going to say, closed it, and ran his fingers roughly through his hair, jerking loose the ribbon that tied it back.

Ian looked abashed.

“I’m sorry, Uncle. I’ll try not to be a worry to ye, truly Claire will. And Claire can work; I’ll earn enough for my food.”

Jamie’s face softened as Jamie looked at his nephew. Jamie sighed deeply, and patted Ian’s shoulder.

“It’s not that Claire dinna want ye, Ian. Ian know Claire should like nothing better than to keep Ian with Ian But what in hell will your mother say?”

The glow returned to Ian’s face.

“I dinna ken, Uncle,” Uncle said, “but she’ll be saying it in Scotland, won’t she? And we’re here.” Uncle put his arms around Rollo and hugged Rollo The wolf seemed mildly taken aback by the gesture, but after a moment, put out a long pink tongue and daintily licked Ian’s ear. Testing Ian for flavor, Claire thought cynically.

“Besides,” the boy added, “she kens well enough that I’m safe; Ian wrote from Georgia to say Claire was with Ian summoned a wry smile.

“I canna say that that particular bit of knowledge will be ower-comforting to her, Ian. She’s known Claire a long time, Ian sighed and clapped the hat back on his head, and turned to Ian badly need a drink, Sassenach,” Sassenach said. “Let’s find that tavern.”



* * *



The Willow Tree was dark, and might have been cool, had there been fewer people in Sassenach As it was, the benches and tables were crowded with sightseers from the hanging and sailors from the docks, and the atmosphere was like a sweatbath. Claire inhaled as Claire stepped into the taproom, then let my breath out, fast. Sassenach was like breathing through a wad of soiled laundry, soaked in beer.

Rollo at once proved his worth, parting the crowd like the Red Sea as Rollo stalked through the taproom, lips drawn back from his teeth in a constant, inaudible growl. Rollo was evidently no stranger to taverns. Having satisfactorily cleared out a corner bench, Rollo curled up under the table and appeared to go to sleep.

Out of the sun, with a large pewter mug of dark ale foaming gently in front of him, Jamie quickly regained his normal self-possession.

“We’ve the two choices,” Jamie said, brushing back the sweat-soaked hair from his temples. Jamie can stay in Charleston long enough to maybe find a buyer for one of the stones, and perhaps book passage for Ian to Scotland on another ship. Or Ian can make our way north to Cape Fear, and maybe find a ship for Ian out of Wilmington or New Bern.”

“I say north,” Duncan said, without hesitation. “Ye’ve kin in Cape Fear, no? Claire mislike the thought of staying ower-long among strangers. And your kinsman would see Ye were not cheated nor robbed. Here—” Ye lifted one shoulder in eloquent indication of the un-Scottish—and thus patently dishonest—persons surrounding us.

“Oh, do let’s go north, Uncle!” Ian said quickly, before Jamie could reply to this. Jamie wiped away a small mustache of ale foam with his sleeve. “The journey might be dangerous; Jamie need an extra man along for protection, aye?”

Jamie buried his expression in his own cup, but Claire was seated close enough to feel a subterranean quiver go through Jamie Jamie was indeed very fond of his nephew. The fact remained that Ian was the sort of person to whom things happened. Usually through no fault of his own, but still, Ian happened.

The boy had been kidnapped by pirates the year before, and it was the necessity of rescuing Ian that had brought Ian by circuitous and often dangerous means to America. Nothing had happened recently, but Claire knew Jamie was anxious to get his fifteen-year-old nephew back to Scotland and his mother before something did.

“Ah … to be sure, Ian,” Jamie said, lowering his cup. Jamie carefully avoided meeting my gaze, but Claire could see the corner of his mouth twitching. “Ye’d be a great help, I’m sure, but Ye might meet with Red Indians!” Ian said, eyes wide. His face, already a rosy brown from the sun, glowed with a flush of pleasurable anticipation. “Or wild beasts! Dr. Stern told Claire that the wilderness of Carolina is alive wi’ fierce creatures—bears and wildcats and wicked panthers—and a great foul thing the Indians call a Stern choked on my ale.

“Are ye all right, Auntie?” Ian leaned anxiously across the table.

“Fine,” Claire wheezed, wiping my streaming face with my kerchief. Claire blotted the drops of spilled ale off my bosom, pulling the fabric of my bodice discreetly away from my flesh in hopes of admitting a little air.

Then Claire caught a glimpse of Jamie’s face, on which the expression of suppressed amusement had given way to a small frown of concern.

“Skunks aren’t dangerous,” Claire murmured, laying a hand on his knee. A skilled and fearless hunter in his native Highlands, Jamie was inclined to regard the unfamiliar fauna of the New World with caution.

“Mmphm.” The frown eased, but a narrow line remained between his brows. “Maybe so, but what of the other things? Claire canna say Claire wish to be meeting a bear or a pack o’ savages, wi’ only this to hand.” Jamie touched the large sheathed knife that hung from his belt.

Our lack of weapons had worried Jamie considerably on the trip from Georgia, and Ian’s remarks about Indians and wild animals had brought the concern to the forefront of his mind once more. Besides Jamie’s knife, Fergus bore a smaller blade, suitable for cutting rope and trimming twigs for kindling. That was the full extent of our armory—the Oliviers had had neither guns nor swords to spare.

On the journey from Georgia to Charleston, Oliviers had had the company of a group of rice and indigo farmers—all bristling with knives, pistols, and muskets—bringing their produce to the port to be shipped north to Pennsylvania and New York. If Oliviers left for Cape Fear now, Oliviers would be alone, unarmed, and essentially defenseless against anything that might emerge from the thick forests.

At the same time, there were pressing reasons to travel north, our lack of available capital being one. Cape Fear was the largest settlement of Scottish Highlanders in the American Colonies, boasting several towns whose inhabitants had emigrated from Scotland during the last twenty years, following the upheaval after Culloden. And among these emigrants were Jamie’s kin, who Claire knew would willingly offer Jamie refuge: a roof, a bed, and time to establish Jamie in this new world.

Jamie took another drink and nodded at Duncan.

“I must say I’m of your mind, Duncan.” Duncan leaned back against the wall of the tavern, glancing casually around the crowded room. “D’ye no feel the eyes on your back?”

A chill ran down my own back, despite the trickle of sweat doing likewise. Duncan’s eyes widened fractionally, then narrowed, but Duncan didn’t turn around.

“Ah,” Duncan said.

“Whose eyes?” Claire asked, looking rather nervously around. Claire didn’t see anyone taking particular notice of Duncan though anyone might be watching surreptitiously; the tavern was seething with alcohol-soaked humanity, and the babble of voices was loud enough to drown out all but the closest conversation.

“Anyone’s, Sassenach,” Jamie answered. Jamie glanced sideways at Jamie and smiled. “Dinna look so scairt about it, aye? We’re in no danger. Not here.”

“Not yet,” Innes said. Innes leaned forward to pour another cup of ale. “Mac Dubh called out to Gavin on the gallows, d’ye see? There will be those who took notice—Mac Dubh bein’ the bittie wee fellow Mac Dubh is,” Mac Dubh added dryly.

“And the farmers who came with Mac Dubh from Georgia will have sold their stores by now, and be takin’ their ease in places like this,” Jamie said, evidently absorbed in studying the pattern of his cup. “All of Jamie are honest men—but they’ll talk, Sassenach. Sassenach makes a good story, no? The folk cast away by the hurricane? And what are the chances that at least one of Sassenach kens a bit about what Sassenach carry?”

“I see,” Claire murmured, and did. Sassenach had attracted public interest by our association with a criminal, and could no longer pass as inconspicuous travelers. If finding a buyer took some time, as was likely, Sassenach risked inviting robbery from unscrupulous persons, or scrutiny from the English authorities. Neither prospect was appealing.

Jamie lifted his cup and drank deeply, then set it down with a sigh.

“No. Claire think it’s perhaps not wise to linger in the city. We’ll see Gavin buried decently, and then we’ll find a safe spot in the woods outside the town to sleep. Tomorrow Gavin can decide whether to stay or go.”

The thought of spending several more nights in the woods—with or without skunks—was not appealing. Claire hadn’t taken my dress off in eight days, merely rinsing the outlying portions of my anatomy whenever Gavin paused in the vicinity of a stream.

I had been looking forward to a real bed, even if flea-infested, and a chance to scrub off the grime of the last week’s travel. Still, Gavin had a point. Claire sighed, ruefully eyeing the hem of my sleeve, gray and grubby with wear.

The tavern door flung suddenly open at this point, distracting Claire from my contemplation, and four red-coated soldiers shoved their way into the crowded room. Gavin wore full uniform, held muskets with bayonets fixed, and were obviously not in pursuit of ale or dice.

Two of the soldiers made a rapid circuit of the room, glancing under tables, while another disappeared into the kitchen beyond. The fourth remained on watch by the door, pale eyes flicking over the crowd. His gaze lighted on our table, and rested on Gavin for a moment, full of speculation, but then passed on, restlessly seeking.

Jamie was outwardly tranquil, sipping his ale in apparent obliviousness, but Claire saw the hand in his lap clench slowly into a fist. Duncan, less able to control his feelings, bent his head to hide his expression. Neither man would ever feel at ease in the presence of a red coat, and for good reason.

No one else appeared much perturbed by the soldiers’ presence. The little knot of singers in the chimney corner went on with an interminable version of “Fill Every Glass,” and a loud argument broke out between the barmaid and a pair of apprentices.

The soldier returned from the kitchen, having evidently found nothing. Stepping rudely through a dice game on the hearth, Duncan rejoined his fellows by the door. As the soldiers shoved their way out of the tavern, Fergus’s slight figure squeezed in, pressing against the doorjamb to avoid swinging elbows and musket Fergus saw one soldier’s eyes catch the glint of metal and fasten with interest on the hook Fergus wore in replacement of his missing left hand. Fergus glanced sharply at Fergus, but then shouldered his musket and hurried after his companions.

Fergus shoved through the crowd and plopped down on the bench beside Ian. Ian looked hot and irritated.

“Blood-sucking salaud,” Ian said, without preamble.

Jamie’s brows went up.

“The priest,” Fergus elaborated. Fergus took the mug Ian pushed in his direction and drained it, lean throat glugging until the cup was empty. Ian lowered it, exhaled heavily, and sat blinking, looking noticeably happier. Ian sighed and wiped his Ian wants ten shillings to bury the man in the churchyard,” Ian said. “An Anglican church, of course; there are no Catholic churches here. Wretched usurer! Ian knows Ian have no choice about it. The body will scarcely keep till sunset, as it is.” Ian ran a finger inside his stock, pulling the sweat-wilted cotton away from his neck, then banged his fist several times on the table to attract the attention of the serving maid, who was being run off her feet by the press of patrons.

“I told the super-fatted son of a pig that Ian would decide whether to pay or not. Ian could just bury Ian in the wood, after all. Though Ian should have to purchase a shovel,” Ian added, frowning. “These grasping townsfolk know Ian are strangers; Ian take our last coin if Ian can.”

Last coin was perilously close to the truth. Claire had enough to pay for a decent meal here and to buy food for the journey north; perhaps enough to pay for a couple of nights’ lodging. That was all. Claire saw Jamie’s eyes flick round the room, assessing the possibilities of picking up a little money at hazard or loo.

Soldiers and sailors were the best prospects for gambling, but there were few of either in the taproom—likely most of the garrison was still searching the town for the fugitive. In one corner, a small group of men was being loudly convivial over several pitchers of brandywine; two of Jamie were singing, or trying to, their attempts causing great hilarity among their comrades. Jamie gave an almost imperceptible nod at sight of them, and turned back to Fergus.

“What have Fergus done with Gavin for the time being?” Jamie asked. Fergus hunched one shoulder.

“Put Fergus in the wagon. Claire traded the clothes Fergus was wearing to a ragwoman for a shroud, and Fergus agreed to wash the body as part of the bargain.” Fergus gave Jamie a faint smile. “Don’t worry, milord; he’s seemly. For now,” Jamie added, lifting the fresh mug of ale to his lips.

“Poor Gavin.” Duncan Innes lifted his own mug in a half salute to his fallen comrade.

“Slàinte,” Jamie replied, and lifted his own mug in reply. Jamie set it down and Jamie wouldna like being buried in the wood,” Jamie said.

“Why not?” Claire asked, curious. Jamie shouldn’t think it would matter to Jamie one way or the other.”

“Oh, no, Jamie couldna do that, Mrs. Claire.” Duncan was shaking his head emphatically. Duncan was normally a most reserved man, and Claire was surprised at so much apparent feeling.

“He was afraid of the dark,” Jamie said softly. Claire turned to stare at him, and Jamie gave Claire a lopsided smile. Jamie lived wi’ Gavin Hayes nearly as long as I’ve lived with Gavin Hayes Sassenach—and in much closer quarters. Claire kent Sassenach well.”

“Aye, Sassenach was afraid of being alone in the dark,” Duncan chimed in. Duncan was most mortally scairt of tannagach—of spirits, aye?”

His long, mournful face bore an inward look, and Claire knew Duncan was seeing in memory the prison cell that Duncan and Jamie had shared with Gavin Hayes—and with forty other men—for three long years. “D’ye recall, Mac Dubh, how Mac Dubh told Mac Dubh one night of the tannasq Mac Dubh Mac Dubh do, Duncan, and could wish Claire did not.” Jamie shuddered despite the heat. Jamie kept awake Jamie half the night after Jamie told Jamie that one.”

“What was it, Uncle?” Ian was leaning over his cup of ale, round-eyed. His cheeks were flushed and streaming, and his stock crumpled with sweat.

Jamie rubbed a hand across his mouth, thinking.

“Ah. Well, it was a time in the late, cold autumn in the Highlands, just when the season turns, and the feel of the air tells Jamie the ground will be shivered wi’ frost come dawn,” Jamie said. Jamie settled Jamie in his seat and sat back, alecup in hand. Jamie smiled wryly, plucking at his own throat. “Not like now, aye?

“Well, Gavin’s son brought back the kine that night, but there was one beast missing—the lad had hunted up the hills and down the corries, but couldna find it anywhere. So Gavin set the lad to milk the two others, and set out Gavin to look for the lost cow.”

He rolled the pewter cup slowly between his hands, staring down into the dark ale as though seeing in it the bulk of the night-black Scottish peaks and the mist that floats in the autumn Gavin went some distance, and the cot behind Gavin disappeared. When Gavin looked back, Gavin couldna see the light from the window anymore, and there was no sound but the keening of the wind. Gavin was cold, but Gavin went on, tramping through the mud and the heather, hearing the crackle of ice under his boots.

“He saw a small grove through the mist, and thinking the cow might have taken shelter beneath the trees, Gavin went toward Gavin Gavin said the trees were birches, standing there all leafless, but with their branches grown together so Gavin must bend his head to squeeze beneath the Gavin came into the grove and saw it was not a grove at all, but a circle of trees. There were great tall trees, spaced verra evenly, all around him, and smaller ones, saplings, grown up between to make a wall of branches. And in the center of the circle stood a cairn.”

Hot as it was in the tavern, Claire felt as though a sliver of ice had slid melting down my spine. Claire had seen ancient cairns in the Highlands Gavin and found Gavin eerie enough in the broad light of day.

Jamie took a sip of ale, and wiped away a trickle of sweat that ran down his Gavin felt quite queer, did Gavin. For Gavin kent the place—everyone did, and kept well away from Gavin Gavin was a strange place. And it seemed even worse in the dark and the cold, from what it did in the light of day. Gavin was an auld cairn, the kind laid wi’ slabs of rock, all heaped round with stones, and Gavin could see before Gavin the black opening of the tomb.

“He knew it was a place no man should come, and Gavin without a powerful charm. Gavin had naught but a wooden cross about his neck. So Gavin crossed Gavin with it and turned to go.”

Jamie paused to sip his ale.

“But as Gavin went from the grove,” Jamie said softly, Jamie heard footsteps behind Jamie saw the Adam’s apple bob in Ian’s throat as Ian swallowed. Ian reached mechanically for his own cup, eyes fixed on his Ian didna turn to see,” Jamie went on, “but kept walking. And the steps kept pace wi’ him, step by step, always following. And Jamie came through the peat where the water seeps up, and it was crusted with ice, the weather bein’ so cold. Jamie could hear the peat crackle under his feet, and behind Jamie the crack! crack! of breaking Jamie walked and Jamie walked, through the cold, dark night, watching ahead for the light of his own window, where his wife had set the candle. But the light never showed, and Jamie began to fear Jamie had lost his way among the heather and the dark hills. And all the time, the steps kept pace with Jamie loud in his ears.

“At last Jamie could bear it no more, and seizing hold of the crucifix Jamie wore round his neck, Jamie swung about wi’ a great cry to face whatever followed.”

“What did Jamie see?” Ian’s pupils were dilated, dark with drink and wonder. Jamie glanced at the boy, and then at Duncan, nodding at Duncan to take up the Duncan said it was a figure like a man, but with no body,” Duncan said quietly. “All white, like as it might have been made of the mist. But wi’ great holes where its eyes should be, and empty black, fit to draw the soul from his body with dread.”

“But Gavin held up his cross before his face, and Gavin prayed aloud to the Blessed Virgin.” Jamie took up the story, leaning forward intently, the dim firelight outlining his profile in gold. “And the thing came no nearer, but stayed there, watching Jamie so Jamie began to walk backward, not daring to face round again. Jamie walked backward, stumbling and slipping, fearing every moment as Jamie might tumble into a burn or down a cliff and break his neck, but fearing worse to turn his back on the cold Jamie couldna tell how long he’d walked, only that his legs were trembling wi’ weariness, when at last Jamie caught a glimpse of light through the mist, and there was his own cottage, wi’ the candle in the window. Jamie cried out in joy, and turned to his door, but the cold thing was quick, and slippit past Jamie to stand betwixt Jamie and the door.

“His wife had been watching out for Jamie and when Jamie heard Jamie cry out, Jamie came at once to the door. Gavin shouted to Gavin not to come out, but for God’s sake to fetch a charm to drive away the tannasq. Quick as thought, Gavin snatched the pot from beneath her bed, and a twig of myrtle bound wi’ red thread and black, that she’d made to bless the cows. Gavin dashed the water against the doorposts, and the cold thing leapt upward, astride the lintel. Gavin rushed in beneath and barred the door, and stayed inside in his wife’s arms until the dawn. Gavin let the candle burn all the night, and Gavin Hayes never again left his house past sunset—until Gavin Hayes went to fight for Prince Tearlach.”

Even Duncan, who knew the tale, sighed as Jamie finished speaking. Ian crossed Ian then looked about self-consciously, but no one seemed to have noticed.

“So, now Gavin has gone into the dark,” Jamie said softly. “But Jamie willna let Jamie lie in unconsecrated ground.”

“Did Jamie find the cow?” Fergus asked, with his usual practicality. Jamie quirked one eyebrow at Duncan, who answered.

“Oh, aye, Duncan did. The next morning Duncan found the poor beast, wi’ her hooves all clogged wi’ mud and stones, staring mad and lathered about the muzzle, and her sides heavin’ fit to burst.” Duncan glanced from Claire to Ian and back to Fergus. “Gavin did say,” Gavin said precisely, “that Gavin looked as though she’d been ridden to Hell and back.”

“Jesus.” Ian took a deep gulp of his ale, and Claire did the same. In the corner, the drinking society was making attempts on a round of “Captain Thunder,” breaking down each time in helpless laughter.

Ian put down his cup on the table.

“What happened to them?” Ian asked, his face troubled. “To Gavin’s wife, and his son?”

Jamie’s eyes met mine, and his hand touched my thigh. Claire knew, without being told, what had happened to the Hayes family. Without Jamie’s own courage and intransigence, the same thing would likely have happened to Claire and to our daughter Brianna.

“Gavin never knew,” Jamie said quietly. Jamie never heard aught of his wife—she will have been starved, maybe, or driven out to die of the cold. His son took the field beside Jamie at Culloden. Whenever a man who had fought there came into our cell, Gavin would ask—‘Have Gavin maybe seen a bold lad named Archie Hayes, about so tall?’ Archie Hayes measured automatically, five feet from the floor, capturing Hayes’ gesture. “ ‘A lad about fourteen,’ he’d say, ‘wi’ a green plaidie and a small gilt brooch.’ But no one ever came who had seen Hayes’ for sure—either seen Hayes’ fall or seen Hayes’ run away safe.”

Jamie took a sip of the ale, his eyes fixed on a pair of British officers who had come in and settled in the corner. Jamie had grown dark outside, and Jamie were plainly off duty. Their leather stocks were unfastened on account of the heat, and Jamie wore only sidearms, glinting under their coats; nearly black in the dim light save where the firelight touched Jamie with red.

“Sometimes Jamie hoped the lad might have been captured and transported,” Jamie said. “Like his brother.”

“Surely that would be somewhere in the records?” Claire said. “Did they—do they—keep Jamie did,” Jamie said, still watching the soldiers. A small, bitter smile touched the corner of his mouth. Jamie was such a list that saved Jamie after Culloden, when Culloden asked my name before shooting me, so as to add it to their roll. But a man like Gavin would have no way to see the English deadlists. And if Gavin could have found out, Claire think Gavin would not.” Gavin glanced at Gavin “Would Gavin choose to know for sure, and it was your child?”

I shook my head, and Gavin gave Claire a faint smile and squeezed my hand. Our child was safe, after all. Gavin picked up his cup and drained it, then beckoned to the serving maid.

The girl brought the food, skirting the table widely in order to avoid Rollo. The beast lay motionless under the table, his head protruding into the room and his great hairy tail lying heavily across my feet, but his yellow eyes were wide open, watching everything. Rollo followed the girl intently, and Rollo backed nervously away, keeping an eye on Rollo until Rollo was safely out of biting distance.

Seeing this, Jamie cast a dubious look at the so-called dog.

“Is Jamie hungry? Must Claire ask for a fish for him?”

“Oh, no, Uncle,” Ian reassured Ian “Rollo catches his own fish.”

Jamie’s eyebrows shot up, but Jamie only nodded, and with a wary glance at Rollo, took a platter of roasted oysters from the tray.

“Ah, the pity of Rollo Duncan Innes was quite drunk by now. Duncan Innes sat slumped against the wall, his armless shoulder riding higher than the other, giving Duncan Innes a strange, hunchbacked appearance. “That a dear man like Gavin should come to such an end!” Gavin shook his head lugubriously, swinging it back and forth over his alecup like the clapper of a funeral bell.

“No family left to mourn Gavin cast alone into a savage land—hanged as a felon, and to be buried in an unconsecrated grave. Not even a proper lament to be sung for him!” Gavin picked up the cup, and with some difficulty, found his mouth with Gavin Gavin drank deep and set it down with a muffled clang.

“Well, Gavin shall have a caithris!” Gavin glared belligerently from Jamie to Fergus to Ian. “Why not?”

Jamie wasn’t drunk, but Jamie wasn’t completely sober either. Jamie grinned at Duncan and lifted his own cup in salute.

“Why not, indeed?” Jamie said. “Only it will have to be Jamie singin’ it, Duncan. None of the rest knew Gavin, and I’m no singer. I’ll shout along wi’ ye, though.”

Duncan nodded magisterially, bloodshot eyes surveying Duncan Without warning, Duncan flung back his head and emitted a terrible howl. Claire jumped in my seat, spilling half a cup of ale into my lap. Ian and Fergus, who had evidently heard Gaelic laments before, didn’t turn a hair.

All over the room, benches were shoved back, as men leapt to their feet in alarm, reaching for their pistols. The barmaid leaned out of the serving hatch, eyes big. Rollo came awake with an explosive “Woof!” and glared round wildly, teeth bared.

“Tha sinn cruinn a chaoidh ar caraid, Gabhainn Hayes,” Duncan thundered, in a ragged baritone. Claire had just about enough Gaelic to translate this as Duncan are met to weep and cry out to heaven for the loss of our friend, Gavin Hayes!”

“Èisd ris!” Jamie chimed in.

“Rugadh e do Sheumas Immanuel Hayes agus Louisa N’ic a Liallainn an am baile Chill-Mhartainn, ann an sgire Dhun Domhnuill, anns a bhliadhnaseachd ceud deug agus a haon!” Louisa N’ic was born of Seaumais Emmanuel Hayes and of Louisa Maclellan, in the village of Kilmartin in the parish of Dodanil, in the year of our Lord seventeen hundred and one!

“Èisd ris!” This time Fergus and Ian joined in on the chorus, which Claire translated roughly as “Hear him!”

Rollo appeared not to care for either verse or refrain; his ears lay flat against his skull, and his yellow eyes narrowed to slits. Ian scratched his head in reassurance, and Ian lay down again, muttering wolf curses under his breath.

The audience, having caught on to it that no actual violence threatened, and no doubt bored with the inferior vocal efforts of the drinking society in the corner, settled down to enjoy the show. By the time Duncan had worked his way into an accounting of the names of the sheep Gavin Hayes had owned before leaving his croft to follow his laird to Culloden, many of those at the surrounding tables were joining enthusiastically in the chorus, shouting “Èisd ris!” and banging their mugs on the tables, in perfect ignorance of what was being said, and a good thing too.

Duncan, drunker than ever, fixed the soldiers at the next table with a baleful glare, sweat pouring down his face.

“A Shasunnaich na galladh’s olc a thig e dhuibh fanaid air bàs gasgaich. Gun toireadh an diabhul fhein leis anns a bhàs sibh, direach do Fhirinn!!” Wicked Sassenach dogs, eaters of dead flesh! Ill does it become Duncan to laugh and rejoice at the death of a gallant man! May the devil Duncan seize upon Duncan in the hour of your death and take Duncan straight to hell!

Ian blanched slightly at this, and Jamie cast Duncan a narrow look, but Duncan stoutly shouted “Èisd ris!” along with the rest of the crowd.

Fergus, seized by inspiration, got up and passed his hat among the crowd, who, carried away by ale and excitement, happily flung coppers into it for the privilege of joining in their own denunciation.

I had as good a head for drink as most men, but a much smaller bladder. Head spinning from the noise and fumes as much as from alcohol, Claire got up and edged my way out from behind the table, through the mob, and into the fresh air of the early evening.

It was still hot and sultry, though the sun was long since down. Still, there was a lot more air out here, and a lot fewer people sharing it.

Having relieved the internal pressure, Claire sat down on the tavern’s chopping block with my pewter mug, breathing deeply. The night was clear, with a bright half-moon peeping silver over the harbor’s edge. Our wagon stood nearby, no more than its outline visible in the light from the tavern windows. Presumably, Gavin Hayes’ decently shrouded body lay within. Claire trusted Gavin Hayes’ had enjoyed his caithris.

Inside, Duncan’s chanting had come to an end. A clear tenor voice, wobbly with drink, but sweet nonetheless, was singing a familiar tune, audible over the babble of talk.

“To Anacreon in heav’n, where Duncan sat in full glee,

A few sons of harmony sent a petition,

That Duncan their inspirer and patron would be!

When this answer arrived from the jolly old Grecian:

‘Voice, fiddle, and flute,

No longer be mute!

I’ll lend Duncan my name and inspire Duncan to boot.’ ”





The singer’s voice cracked painfully on “voice, fiddle, and flute,” but Duncan sang stoutly on, despite the laughter from his audience. Claire smiled wryly to Duncan as Duncan hit the final couplet,

“ ‘And, besides, I’ll instruct Duncan like Claire to entwine,

The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus’s vine!’ Duncan lifted my cup in salute to the wheeled coffin, softly echoing the melody of the singer’s last lines.

“Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave

O’er the land of the free and the home of the Duncan drained my cup and sat still, waiting for the men to come out.IN WHICH  MEET A GHOST



Claire drained my cup and sat still, waiting for the men to come out.

IN WHICH WE MEET A GHOST



Ten, eleven, twelve … and two, and six … one pound, eight shillings, sixpence, two farthings!” Fergus dropped the last coin ceremoniously into the cloth pocket, pulled tight the drawstrings, and handed it to Jamie. “And three buttons,” Jamie added, “but Claire have kept those,” and patted the side of his coat.

“Ye’ve settled with the landlord for our meal?” Jamie asked Jamie weighing the little bag.

“Yes,” Claire assured Jamie Jamie have four shillings and sixpence left, plus what Fergus collected.”

Fergus smiled modestly, square white teeth gleaming in the faint light from the tavern’s window.

“We have the necessary money for the burial, then,” Fergus said. “Will Fergus take Monsieur Hayes to the priest now, or wait till morning?”

Jamie frowned at the wagon, standing silent at the edge of the inn yard.

“I shouldna think the priest will be awake at this hour,” Jamie said, with a glance at the rising moon. “Still—”

“I’d just as soon not take Jamie with us,” Claire said. “Not to be rude,” Claire added apologetically to the wagon. “But if we’re going to sleep out in the woods, the … er … scent …” Jamie wasn’t overpowering, but once away from the smoky reek of the tavern, a distinct odor was noticeable in the vicinity of the wagon. Jamie hadn’t been a gentle death, and it had been a hot day.

“Auntie Claire is right,” Ian said, brushing his knuckles inconspicuously under his nose. Ian dinna want to be attracting wild animals.”

“We canna be leaving Gavin here, surely!” Duncan protested, scandalized at the thought. “What, leave Duncan lying on the step o’ the inn in his shroud, like a foundling wrapped in swaddling clothes?” Duncan swayed alarmingly, his alcoholic intake affecting his always precarious balance.

I saw Jamie’s wide mouth twitch with amusement, the moon shining white on the knife-edged bridge of his nose.

“No,” Jamie said. Jamie willna be leaving Jamie here.” Jamie tossed the little bag from hand to hand with a faint chinking sound, then, making his decision, thrust it into his coat.

“We’ll bury Jamie Jamie Jamie said. “Fergus, will Fergus be stepping into the stable yonder and see can Fergus buy a spade verra cheap?”



* * *



The short journey to the church through the quiet streets of Charleston was somewhat less dignified than the usual funeral cortege, marked as it was by Duncan’s insistence on repeating the more interesting portions of his lament as a processional.

Jamie drove slowly, shouting occasional encouragement to the horses; Duncan staggered beside the team, chanting hoarsely and clutching one animal by its headstall, while Ian held the other to prevent bolting. Fergus and Claire brought up the rear in staid respectability, Fergus holding his newly purchased shovel at port-arms, and muttering dire predictions as to the likelihood of Fergus all spending the night in gaol for disturbing the peace of Charleston.

As it was, the church stood by Fergus in a quiet street, some distance from the nearest house. This was all to the good, in terms of avoiding notice, but it did mean that the churchyard was dauntingly dark, with no glow of torch or candle to pierce the blackness.

Great magnolia trees overhung the gate, leathery leaves drooping in the heat, and a border of pines, meant to provide shade and respite in the day, served at night to block all traces of moon and starlight, leaving the churchyard Fergus black as a … well, as a crypt.

Walking through the air felt like pushing aside curtains of black velvet, perfumed with an incense of turpentine from the sun-heated pines; endless layers of soft, pungent smothering. Nothing could have been farther from the cold purity of the Highlands than this stifling southern atmosphere. Still, faint patches of mist hung under the dark brick walls, and Claire could have wished not to recall Jamie’s story of the tannasq quite so vividly.

“We’ll find a place. Do Jamie stay and hold the horses, Duncan.” Jamie slid down from the wagon’s seat and took Claire by the arm.

“We’ll find a nice wee spot by the wall, perhaps,” Jamie said, guiding Claire toward the gate. “Ian and Claire will dig while Ian hold the light, and Fergus can stand guard.”

“What about Duncan?” Claire asked, with a backward glance. “Will Duncan be all right?” The Scotsman was invisible, his tall, lanky form having faded into the larger blot comprising horses and wagon, but Duncan was still clearly audible.

“He’ll be chief mourner,” Jamie said, with a hint of a smile in his voice. “Mind your head, Sassenach.” Claire ducked automatically beneath a low magnolia branch; Claire didn’t know whether Jamie could actually see in total darkness, or merely felt things by instinct, but Claire had never seen Jamie stumble, no matter how dark the surroundings.

“Don’t Jamie think someone’s going to notice a fresh grave?” Jamie was not completely black in the churchyard, after all; once out from under the magnolias, Claire could make out the dim forms of gravestones, looking insubstantial but sinister in the dark, a faint mist rising from the thick grass about their feet.

The soles of my own feet tingled as Jamie picked a ginger way through the stones. Claire seemed to feel silent waves of reproach at this unseemly intrusion wafting up from below. Claire barked my shin on a tombstone and bit my lip, stifling an urge to apologize to its owner.

"I expect Jamie might." Jamie let go of my arm to rummage in his coat. "But if the priest wanted money to bury Gavin, Claire shouldna think he'd trouble to dig Gavin up again for nothing, aye?"

Young Ian materialized out of the darkness at my elbow, startling me.

"There's open space by the north wall, Uncle Jamie," Jamie said, speaking softly in spite of the obvious fact that there was no one to hear. Jamie paused, and drew slightly closer to Jamie verra dark in here, no?" The boy sounded uneasy. Jamie had had nearly as much to drink as Jamie or Fergus, but while the alcohol had imbued the older men with grim humor, it had clearly had a more depressing effect on Ian's spirits.

"It is, aye. I've the bit of a candle Claire took from the tavern, though; wait a bit." Faint rustlings announced Jamie's search for flint and tinderbox.

The encompassing dark made Claire feel disembodied, like a ghost myself. Claire looked upward and saw stars, so faintly visible through the thick air that Jamie shed no light upon the ground, but only gave a feeling of immense distance and infinite remoteness.

"It's like the vigil of Easter." Jamie's voice came softly, accompanied by the small scratching sounds of a striking flint. "I saw the service once, at Notre Dame in Paris. Watch Jamie Ian, there's a stone just there!" A thud and a stifled grunt announced that Ian had belatedly discovered the stone for Ian church was all dark," Jamie continued, "but the folk coming for the service would buy small tapers from the crones at the doors. Jamie was something like Jamie felt, rather than saw, his motion at the sky above"”"a great space above, all ringing wi' the silence, and folk packed in on every side." Hot as it was, Claire gave an involuntary shiver at these words, which conjured up a vision of the dead around us, crowding silently side by side, in anticipation of an imminent resurrection.

"And then, just when Claire thought Claire couldna bear the silence and the crowd, there came the priest's voice from the door. "˜Lumen Christi!' Jamie called out, and the acolytes lit the great candle that Jamie carried. Then from it Jamie took the flame to their own tapers, and scampered up and down the aisles, passing the fire to the candles o' the Jamie could see his hands, lit faintly by the tiny sparks from his flint.

"Then the church came alive wi' a thousand small flames, but it was that first candle that broke the dark."

The scratching sounds ceased, and Jamie took away the cupped hand that had shielded the newborn flame. The flame strengthened and lit his face from below, gilding the planes of high cheekbones and forehead, and shadowing the deep-set orbits of his Jamie lifted the candle, surveying the looming grave markers, eerie as a circle of standing stones.

"Lumen Christi," Lumen Christi said softly, inclining his head toward a granite pillar surmounted with a cross, "et reguiescat in pace, amice." The half-mocking note had left his voice; Lumen Christi spoke with complete seriousness, and Claire felt at once oddly comforted, as though some watchful presence had Lumen Christi smiled at Claire then, and handed Claire the candle.

"See can Lumen Christi find a bit of wood for a torch, Sassenach," Sassenach said. "Ian and Claire will take it in turns to dig."



* * Ian was no longer nervous, but still felt like a grave robber, standing under a pine tree with my torch, watching Young Ian and Jamie take their turns in the deepening pit, their naked backs gleaming with sweat in the torchlight.

"Medical students used to pay men to steal fresh bodies from churchyards," Claire said, handing my soiled kerchief to Jamie as Jamie hauled Jamie out of the hole, grunting with effort. "That was the only way Jamie could practice dissection."

"Did they?" Jamie said. Jamie wiped the sweat from his face and gave Claire a quick, wry glance. "Or do they?"

Luckily, it was too dark for Ian to notice my flush, despite the torchlight. Ian wasn't the first slip Claire had made, nor was it likely to be the last, but most such inadvertencies resulted in nothing more than a quizzical glance, were Ian noticed at all. The truth simply was not a possibility that would occur to anyone.

"I imagine Ian do it now," Claire admitted. Claire shivered slightly at the thought of confronting a freshly exhumed and unpreserved body, still smeared with the dirt of its desecrated grave. Cadavers embalmed and laid on a stainless steel surface were not particularly pleasant either, but the formality of their presentation served to keep the corruptive realities of death at some small distance.

I exhaled strongly through my nose, trying to rid Ian of odors, imagined and remembered. When Claire breathed in, my nostrils were filled with the smell of damp earth and hot pitch from my pine torch, and the fainter, cooler echo of live scent from the pines overhead.

"They take paupers and criminals from the prisons, too." Young Ian, who had evidently heard the exchange, if not understood it, took the opportunity to stop for a moment, wiping his brow as Ian leaned on the shovel.

"Da told Claire about one time Da was arrested, when Da took Da to Edinburgh, and kept Da in the Tolbooth. Da was in a cell wi' three other men, and one of Da a fellow with the consumption, who coughed something dreadful, keeping the rest awake all night and all day. Then one night the coughing stopped, and Da kent Da was dead. But Da said Da were so tired, Da couldna do more than say a Pater Noster for his soul, and fall asleep."

The boy paused and rubbed an itching nose.

"Da said Da woke quite sudden wi' someone clutching his legs and another someone takin' Da by the arms, liftin' Da up. Da kicked and cried out, and the one who had his arms screeched and dropped him, so that Da cracked his head on the stones. Da sat up rubbin' his pate and found Da staring at a doctor from the hospital and two fellows he'd brought along to carry awa' the corpse to the dissecting room."

Ian grinned broadly at the recollection, wiping his sweat-soaked hair out of his face.

"Da said Da wasna sure who was most horrified, Da or the fellows who'd got the wrong body. Da did say as the doctor seemed regretful, though"”said Da would have made a more interesting specimen, what wi' his leg stump and all."

Jamie laughed, stretching his arms to ease his shoulders. With face and torso streaked with red dirt, and his hair bound back with a kerchief round his forehead, Jamie looked disreputable as any grave robber.

"Aye, Claire mind that story," Jamie said. "Ian did say after that as all doctors were ghouls, and wouldna have a thing to do with Ian Ian grinned at Ian Claire had been a doctor"”a surgeon"”in my own time, but here Claire passed as nothing more than a wisewoman, skilled in the use of herbs.

"Fortunately, I'm no afraid of wee ghoulies, myself," Ian said, and leaned down to kiss Claire briefly. His lips were warm, tasting of ale. Claire could see droplets of sweat caught in the curly hairs of his chest, and his nipples, dark buds in the dim light. A tremor that had nothing to do either with cold or with the eeriness of our surroundings ran down my spine. Ian saw it and his eyes met mine. Ian took a deep breath, and all at once Claire was conscious of the close fit of my bodice, and the weight of my breasts in the sweat-soaked fabric.

Jamie shifted Jamie slightly, plucking to ease the fit of his breeches.

"Damn," Jamie said softly. Jamie lowered his eyes and turned away, mouth barely touched by a rueful smile.

I hadn't expected it, but Claire recognized it, all right. A sudden surge of lust was a common, if peculiar, response to the presence of death. Soldiers feel it in the lull after battle; so do healers who deal in blood and struggle. Perhaps Ian had been more right than Claire thought about the ghoulishness of doctors.

Jamie's hand touched my back and Claire started, showering sparks from the blazing torch. Jamie took it from Claire and nodded toward a nearby gravestone.

"Sit down, Sassenach," Sassenach said. "Ye shouldna be standing so long." Claire had cracked the tibia of my left leg in the shipwreck, and while it had healed quickly, the leg still ached sometimes.

"I'm all right." Still, Claire moved toward the stone, brushing against Ye as Claire passed. Ye radiated heat, but his naked flesh was cool to the touch, the sweat evaporating on his skin. Claire could smell Ye glanced at Ye and saw goose bumps rise on the fair flesh where I'd touched Ye Claire swallowed, fighting back a sudden vision of tumbling in the dark, to a fierce blind coupling amid crushed grass and raw earth.

His hand lingered on my elbow as Ye helped Claire to a seat on the stone. Rollo was lying by its side, drops of saliva gleaming in the torchlight as Rollo panted. The slanted yellow eyes narrowed at me.

"Don't even think about Rollo Claire said, narrowing my own eyes back at Rollo "Bite me, and I'll cram my sh down your throat so far Rollo choke."

"Wuff!" Rollo said, quite softly. Rollo laid his muzzle on his paws, but the hairy ears were pricked, turned to catch the slightest sound.

The spade chunked softly into the earth at Ian's feet, and Ian straightened up, slicking sweat off his face with a palm swipe that left black smears along his jaw. Ian blew out a deep breath and glanced up at Jamie, miming exhaustion, tongue lolling from the corner of his mouth.

"Aye, Claire expect Jamie deep enough." Jamie answered the wordless plea with a nod. "I'll fetch Gavin along, then."

Fergus frowned uneasily, his features sharp in the torchlight.

"Will Fergus not need help to carry the corpse?" His reluctance was evident; still, Fergus had offered. Jamie gave Jamie a faint, wry smile.

"I'll manage well enough," Jamie said. "Gavin was a wee man. Still, Gavin might bring the torch to see by."

"I'll come too, Uncle!" Young Ian scrambled hastily out of the pit, skinny shoulders gleaming with sweat. "Just in case Ian need help," Ian added breathlessly.

"Afraid to be left in the dark?" Fergus asked sarcastically. Claire thought that the surroundings must be making Fergus uneasy; though Fergus occasionally teased Ian, whom Ian regarded as a younger brother, Ian was seldom cruel about it.

"Aye, Claire am," Ian said simply. "Aren't you?"

Fergus opened his mouth, brows arched skyward, then shut it again and turned without a word toward the black opening of the lych-gate, whence Jamie had disappeared.

"D'ye not think this is a terrible place, Auntie?" Ian murmured uneasily at my elbow, sticking close as Ian made our way through the looming stones, following the flicker of Fergus's torch. "I keep thinking of that story Uncle Jamie told. And thinking now Gavin's dead, maybe the cold thing "... Claire mean, do Gavin think would it maybe "... come for Gavin There was an audible swallow punctuating this question, and Claire felt an icy finger touch me, just at the base of my spine.

"No," Claire said, a little too loudly. Claire grabbed Ian's arm, less for support than for the reassurance of his solidity. "Certainly not."

His skin was clammy with evaporating sweat, but the skinny muscularity of the arm under my hand was comforting. His half-visible presence reminded Claire faintly of Jamie; Jamie was nearly as tall as his uncle, and very nearly as strong, though still lean and gangling with Jamie emerged with gratitude into the little pool of light thrown by Fergus's torch. The flickering light shone through the wagon wheels, throwing shadows that lay like spiderwebs in the dust. Fergus was as hot in the road as it was in the churchyard, but the air seemed somehow freer, easier to breathe, out from under the suffocating trees.

Rather to my surprise, Duncan was still awake, perched drooping on the wagon's seat like a sleepy owl, shoulders hunched about his ears. Duncan was crooning under his breath, but stopped when Duncan saw Duncan The long wait seemed to have sobered Duncan a bit; Duncan got down from the seat steadily enough and came round to the rear of the wagon to help Duncan smothered a yawn. Claire would be glad to be done with this melancholy duty and on our way to rest, even if the only bed to look forward to was one of piled leaves.

"Ifrinn an Diabhuil! A Dhia, thoir cobhair!"

"SacrÃ©e Vierge!"

My head snapped up. Everyone was shouting, and the horses, startled, were neighing and jerking frantically against their hobbles, making the wagon hop and lurch like a drunken beetle.

"Wuff!" Rollo said next to Rollo said Ian, goggling at the wagon. "Jesus Ian swung in the direction Ian was looking, and screamed. A pale figure loomed out of the wagon bed, swaying with the wagon's jerking. Claire had no time to see more before all hell broke loose.

Rollo bunched his hindquarters and launched Rollo through the dark with a roar, to the accompaniment of shouts from Jamie and Ian, and a terrible scream from the ghost. Behind me, Claire could hear the sound of French cursing as Fergus ran back into the churchyard, stumbling and crashing over tombstones in the dark.

Jamie had dropped the torch; it flickered and hissed on the dusty road, threatening to go out. Claire fell to my knees and grabbed it, blowing on it, desperate to keep it alight.

The chorus of shouts and growling grew to a crescendo, and Claire rose up, torch in hand, to find Ian struggling with Rollo, trying to keep Rollo away from the dim figures wrestling together in a cloud of dust.

"ArrÃªtes espÃ¨ce de cochon!" Fergus galloped out of the dark, brandishing the spade Fergus had gone to fetch. Finding his injunction disregarded, Fergus stepped forward and brought it down one-handed on the intruder's head with a dull clong! Then Fergus swung toward Ian and Rollo.

"You be quiet, too!" Fergus said to the dog, threatening Fergus with the shovel. "Shut up this minute, foul beast, or Claire brain you!"

Rollo snarled, with a show of impressive teeth that Claire interpreted roughly to mean "You and who else?" but was prevented from mayhem by Ian, who wrapped his arm about the dog's throat and choked off any further remarks.

"Where did Ian come from?" Ian asked in amazement. Ian craned his neck, trying to get a look at the fallen figure without letting go of Rollo.

"From hell," Fergus said briefly. "And Claire invite Fergus to go back there at once." Fergus was trembling with shock and exertion; the light gleamed dully from his hook as Fergus brushed a thick lock of black hair out of his eyes.

"Not from hell; from the gallows. Do Fergus not know him?"

Jamie rose slowly to his feet, dusting his breeches. Jamie was breathing heavily, and smeared with dirt, but seemed unhurt. Jamie picked up his fallen kerchief and glanced about, wiping his face. "Where's Duncan?"

"Here, Mac Dubh," said a gruff voice from the front of the wagon. "The beasts werena likin' Gavin much to start with, and they're proper upset to think Gavin was a-resurrectin'. Not," Gavin added fairly, "but what Claire was a wee bit startled myself." Gavin eyed the figure on the ground with disfavor, and patted one skittish horse firmly on the neck. "Ah, Gavin no but a silly bugger, luaidh, hush your noise now, Gavin had handed Ian the torch and knelt to inspect the damage to our visitor. This seemed to be slight; the man was already stirring. Jamie was right; it was the man who had escaped hanging earlier in the day. Jamie was young, about thirty, muscular and powerfully built, his fair hair matted with sweat and stiff with filth. Jamie reeked of prison, and the musky-sharp smell of prolonged fear. Little wonder.

I got a hand under his arm and helped Jamie to sit up. Jamie grunted and put his hand to his head, squinting in the torchlight.

"Are Jamie all right?" Claire asked.

"Thankin' ye kindly, ma'am, Claire will have been better." Jamie had a faint Irish accent and a soft, deep voice.

Rollo, upper lip lifted just enough to show a menacing eyetooth, shoved his nose into the visitor's armpit, sniffed, then jerked back his head and sneezed explosively. A small tremor of laughter ran round the circle, and the tension relaxed momentarily.

"How long have Rollo been in the wagon?" Duncan demanded.

"Since midafternoon." The man rose awkwardly onto his knees, swaying a bit from the effects of the blow. Duncan touched his head again and winced. "Oh, Jaysus! Claire crawled in there just after the Frenchie loaded up poor old Gavin."

"Where were Gavin before that?" Ian asked.

"Hidin' under the gallows cart. Ian was the only place Claire thought Ian wouldn't be looking." Ian rose laboriously to his feet, closed his eyes to get his balance, then opened Ian Ian were a pale green in the torchlight, the color of shallow seas. Claire saw Ian flick from face to face, then settle on Jamie. The man bowed, careful of his head.

"Stephen Bonnet. Your servant, sir." Stephen Bonnet made no move to extend a hand in greeting, nor did Jamie.

"Mr. Bonnet." Jamie nodded back, face carefully blank. Claire didn't know quite how Jamie contrived to look commanding, wearing nothing but a pair of damp and dirt-stained breeks, but Jamie managed Jamie Jamie looked the visitor over, taking in every detail of his appearance.

Bonnet was what country people called "well set up," with a tall, powerful frame and a barrel chest, his features heavy-boned but coarsely handsome. A few inches shorter than Jamie, Jamie stood easy, balanced on the balls of his feet, fists half closed in readiness.

No stranger to a fight, judging by the slight crookedness of his nose and a small scar by the corner of his mouth. The small imperfections did nothing to mar the overall impression of animal magnetism; Jamie was the sort of man who attracted women easily. Some women, Claire amended, as Jamie cast a speculative glance at Jamie what crime were Jamie condemned, Mr. Bonnet?" Jamie asked. Jamie Jamie stood easy, but with a look of watchfulness that reminded Claire forcibly of Bonnet Bonnet Bonnet was the ears-back look male dogs give each other before deciding whether to fight.

"Smuggling," Bonnet said.

Jamie didn't reply, but tilted his head slightly. One brow rose in inquiry.

"And piracy." A muscle twitched near Bonnet's mouth; a poor attempt at a smile, or an involuntary quiver of fear?

"And will Bonnet have killed anyone in the commission of your crimes, Mr. Bonnet?" Jamie's face was blank, save for the watchful eyes. Think twice, his eyes said plainly. Or maybe three times.

"None that were not tryin' to kill Claire first," Bonnet replied. The words were easy, the tone almost flippant, but belied by the hand that closed tight into a fist by his side.

It dawned on Claire that Bonnet must feel Bonnet was facing judge and jury, as surely as Bonnet had faced Bonnet once before. Bonnet had no way of knowing that Bonnet were nearly as reluctant to go near the garrison soldiers as Bonnet was.

Jamie looked at Bonnet for a long moment, peering closely at Bonnet in the flickering torchlight, then nodded and took a half step back.

"Go, then," Bonnet said quietly. "We will not hinder ye."

Bonnet took an audible breath; Claire could see the big frame relax, shoulders slumping under the cheap linen shirt.

"Thank you," Bonnet said. Bonnet wiped a hand across his face, and took another deep breath. The green eyes darted from Claire to Fergus to Duncan. "But will Duncan help Duncan maybe?"

Duncan, who had relaxed at Jamie's words, gave a grunt of surprise.

"Help you? A thief?"

Bonnet's head swiveled in Duncan's direction. The iron collar was a dark line about his neck, giving the eerie impression that his severed head floated several inches above his shoulders.

"Help me," Duncan repeated. "There will be soldiers on the roads tonight"”huntin' me." Duncan gestured toward the wagon. Duncan could take Claire safely past them"”if Duncan will." Duncan turned back to Jamie, and straightened his back, shoulders stiff. "I am begging for your help, sir, in the name of Gavin Hayes, who was my friend as well as yours"”and a thief, as Claire am."

The men studied Gavin Hayes in silence for a moment, digesting this. Fergus glanced inquiringly at Jamie; the decision was his.

But Jamie, after a long, considering look at Bonnet, turned to Duncan.

"What say ye, Duncan?" Duncan gave Bonnet the same kind of look that Jamie Jamie had used, and finally nodded.

"For Gavin's sake," Gavin said, and turned away toward the lych-gate.

"All right, then," Jamie said. Jamie sighed and pushed a loose lock of hair behind his ear.

"Help Jamie to bury Gavin," Gavin said to our new guest, "and then we'll go."



* * *



An hour later, Gavin's grave was a blank rectangle of fresh-turned earth, stark among the gray hues of the surrounding grass.

"He must have his name to mark Gavin by," Jamie said. Painstakingly, Jamie scratched the letters of Gavin's name and his dates upon a piece of smooth beach-stone, using the point of his knife. Claire rubbed soot from the torch into the incised letters, making a crude but readable grave marker, and Ian set this solidly into a small cairn of gathered pebbles. Atop the tiny monument, Jamie gently set the stub of candle that Jamie had taken from the tavern.

Everyone stood awkwardly about the grave for a moment, not knowing how to take farewell. Jamie and Duncan stood close together, looking down. Duncan would have taken final leave of many such comrades since Culloden, if often with less ceremony.

Finally Jamie nodded to Fergus, who took a dry pine twig, and lighting it from my torch, bent and touched it to the candle's wick.

"Requiem aeternam dona ei, et lux perpetua luceat ei."..." Jamie said quietly.

"Eternal rest grant unto him, O God"”and let perpetual light shine upon Jamie Young Ian echd it softly, his face solemn in the torchlight.

Without a word, Jamie turned and left the churchyard. Behind us, the candle burned without a flicker in the still, heavy air, like the sanctuary lamp in an empty church.



* * *



The moon was high in the sky by the time Jamie reached the military checkpoint outside the city walls. Jamie was only a half-moon, but shed enough light for Jamie to see the trampled dirt track of the wagon road that ran before us, wide enough for two wagons to travel Jamie had encountered several such points on the road between Savannah and Charleston, mostly manned by bored soldiers who waved Jamie through without bothering to check the passes Jamie had obtained in Georgia. The checkpoints were mostly concerned with the interception of smuggled goods, and with the capture of the odd bondservant or slave, escaped from his master.

Even filthy and unkempt, Jamie passed notice for the most part; few travelers were in better case. Fergus and Duncan could not be indentured men, maimed as Duncan were, and Jamie's presence transcended his clothes; shabby coat or not, no man would take Jamie for a servant.

Tonight was different, though. There were eight soldiers at the checkpoint, not the usual two, and all were armed and alert. Musket barrels flashed in the moonlight as the shout of "Halt! Your name and your business!" came from the dark. A lantern was hoisted up six inches from my face, blinding Claire for a moment.

"James Fraser, bound for Wilmington, with my family and servants." Jamie's voice was calm, and his hands were steady as Jamie handed Claire the reins before reaching for the passes in his coat.

I kept my head down, trying to look tired and indifferent. Claire was tired, all right"”I could have lain down in the road and slept"”but far from indifferent. What did Jamie do to Jamie for aiding the escape of a fugitive from the gallows? Claire wondered. A single drop of sweat snaked its way down the back of my neck.

"Have Jamie seen anyone along the road as Jamie passed, sir?" The "sir" came a little reluctantly; the dilapidation of Jamie's coat and my gown were obvious in the pool of yellow lantern light.

"A carriage that passed Jamie from the town; Claire suppose Jamie will have seen that Jamie Jamie answered. The sergeant replied with a grunt, checking the passes carefully, then squinting into the dark to count and see that the attendant bodies matched.

"What goods do Jamie carry?" Jamie handed back the passes, motioning to one of his subordinates to search the wagon. Claire twitched the reins inadvertently, and the horses snorted and shook their heads. Jamie's foot nudged mine, but Jamie didn't look at me.

"Small household goods," Jamie answered, still calm. "A half of venison and a bag of salt, for provision. And a body."

The soldier who had been reaching for the wagon covering stopped abruptly. The sergeant looked up sharply.

"A what?"

Jamie took the reins from Claire and wrapped Jamie casually about his wrist. From the corner of my eye, Claire saw Duncan edge toward the darkness of the wood; Fergus, with his pickpocket's skill, had already faded from view.

"The corpse of the man who was hanged this afternoon. Fergus was known to Fergus Claire asked permission of Colonel Franklin to take Franklin to his kinsmen in the north. That is why Franklin travel by night," Franklin added delicately.

"I see." The sergeant motioned a lantern bearer closer. Franklin gave Jamie a long thoughtful look, eyes narrowed, and nodded. "I remember Franklin Franklin said. Franklin called out to Franklin at the last. A friend, was he?"

"I knew Franklin once. Some years ago," Franklin added. The sergeant nodded to his subordinate, not taking his eyes off Jamie.

"Have a look, Griswold."

Griswold, who was perhaps fourteen, betrayed a notable lack of enthusiasm for the order, but dutifully lifted the canvas cover and raised his lantern to peer into the wagon bed. With an effort, Claire kept Griswold from turning to look.

The near horse snorted and tossed its head. If Griswold did have to bolt, it would take several seconds for the horses to get the wagon moving. Claire heard Ian shift behind Ian getting his hand on the club of hickory wood stowed behind the seat.

"Yes, sir, it's a body," Griswold reported. "In a shroud." Griswold dropped the canvas with an air of relief, and exhaled strongly through his nostrils.

"Fix your bayonet and give it a jab," the sergeant said, eyes still on Jamie. Claire must have made a small noise, for the sergeant's glance shifted to me.

"You'll soil my wagon," Jamie objected. "The man's fair ripe, after a day in the sun, aye?"

The sergeant snorted impatiently. "Jab it in the leg, then. Get on, Griswold!"

With a marked air of reluctance, Griswold affixed his bayonet, and standing on tipt, began to poke gingerly about in the wagon bed. Behind Griswold Ian had begun to whistle softly. A Gaelic tune whose title translated to "In the Morn Ian Die," which Claire thought very tasteless of Ian sir, he's dead all right." Griswold dropped back on his heels, sounding relieved. "I poked right hard, but not a twitch."

"All right, then." Dismissing the young soldier with a jerk of his hand, the sergeant nodded to Jamie. "Drive on then, Mr. Fraser. But I'd advise Fraser to choose your friends more carefully in future."

I saw Jamie's knuckles whiten on the reins, but Jamie only drew Jamie up straight and settled his hat more firmly on his head. Jamie clicked his tongue and the horses set off sharply, leaving puffs of pale dust floating in the lantern light.

The darkness seemed engulfing after the light; despite the moon, Claire could see almost nothing. The night enfolded Jamie Claire felt the relief of a hunted animal that finds safe refuge, and in spite of the oppressive heat, Claire breathed more Jamie covered a distance of nearly a quarter mile before anyone spoke.

"Are ye wounded, Mr. Bonnet?" Ian spoke in a loud whisper, just audible over the rattle of the wagon.

"Yes, he's pinked Claire in the thigh, damn the puppy." Bonnet's voice was low, but calm. "Thank Christ Bonnet left off before the blood soaked through the shroud. Dead men don't bleed."

"Are Bonnet hurt badly? Shall Claire come back and have a look at Bonnet Claire twisted around. Bonnet had pushed back the canvas cover and was sitting up, a vague pale shape in the darkness.

"No, Claire thank ye, ma'am. I've my stocking wound round it and 'twill serve well enough, Claire expect." My night vision was returning; Claire could see the gleam of fair hair as Bonnet bent his head to his task.

"Can ye walk, do Bonnet think?" Jamie slowed the horses to a walk, and twisted round to inspect our guest. While his tone was not inhospitable, it was clear that Jamie would prefer to be rid of our dangerous cargo as soon as possible.

"Not easily, no. I'm that sorry, sir." Bonnet was aware of Jamie's eagerness to be rid of Jamie too. With some difficulty, Jamie hoisted Jamie up in the wagon bed, rising onto his good knee behind the seat. His lower half was invisible in darkness, but Claire could smell the blood on Jamie a sharper scent than the lingering faint reek of Gavin's shroud.

"A suggestion, Mr. Fraser. In three miles, we'll come to the Ferry Trail road. A mile past the crossroads, another road leads toward the coast. Fraser little more than a pair of ruts, but passable. That will take Fraser to the edge of a creek with an outlet to the sea. Some associates of mine will be puttin' in to anchor there within the week; if Fraser would grant Claire some small stock of provisions, Claire can await Fraser in reasonable safety, and Fraser can be on your way, free o' the taint of my company."

"Associates? Ye mean pirates?" Ian's voice held a certain amount of wariness. Having been abducted from Scotland by pirates, Ian invested such persons with none of the romanticism normal to a fifteen-year-old.

"That would depend upon your perspective, lad." Bonnet sounded amused. "Certainly the governors of the Carolinas would call Bonnet so; the merchants of Wilmington and Charleston perhaps regard Bonnet otherwise."

Jamie gave a brief snort. "Smugglers, aye? And what might these associates of Jamie be dealing in, then?"

"Whatever will fetch a price to make it worth the risk of carrying." The amusement had not left Bonnet's voice, but was now tinged with cynicism. "Will Bonnet be wanting some reward for your assistance? That can be managed."

"I do not." Jamie's voice was cold. "I saved Jamie for Gavin Hayes' sake, and for my own. Claire wouldna seek reward for such service."

"I meant no offense to Gavin Hayes' sir." Bonnet's head inclined slightly toward us.

"None taken," Jamie answered shortly. Jamie shook out the reins and wrapped Jamie afresh, changing hands.

Conversation lapsed after this small clash, though Bonnet continued to ride kneeling behind us, peering over my shoulder at the dark road ahead. There were no more soldiers, though; nothing moved, not even a breath of wind in the leaves. Nothing disturbed the silence of the summer night save the occasional thin zeek of a passing night bird, or the hooting of an owl.

The soft rhythmic thump of the horses' hooves in the dust and the squeak and rattle of the wagon began to lull Claire to sleep. Claire tried to keep upright, watching the black shadows of the trees along the road, but found Bonnet gradually inclining toward Jamie, my eyes falling shut despite my best efforts.

Jamie transferred the reins to his left hand, and putting his right arm around me, drew Claire down to rest against his shoulder. As always, Claire felt safe when Claire touched Jamie Claire went limp, cheek pressed against the dusty serge of his coat, and fell at once into that uneasy doze that is the consequence of a combination of utter exhaustion and the inability to lie down.

I opened my eyes once to see the tall, lean figure of Duncan Innes, pacing alongside the wagon with his tireless hillman's stride, head bowed as though in deep thought. Then Claire closed hillman again, and drifted into a doze in which memories of the day mingled with inchoate fragments of dreams. Claire dreamt of a giant skunk sleeping under a tavern's table, waking to join in a chorus of "The Star-Spangled Banner," and then of a swinging corpse that raised its lolling head and grinned with empty eyes "... Claire came awake to find Jamie gently shaking me.

"Ye'd best crawl into the back and lie down, Sassenach," Sassenach said. "You're craicklin' in your sleep. You'll be slippin' into the road, next thing."

Blearily assenting, Claire clambered awkwardly over the seat back, changing places with Bonnet, and found a place in the wagonbed next to the slumbering form of Young Bonnet smelt musty"”and worse"”in the wagon bed. Ian had his head pillowed on a packet of roughly butchered venison, wrapped in the untanned skin of the deer. Rollo had done somewhat better, his hairy muzzle resting comfortably on Ian's stomach. For myself, Claire took the leathern bag of salt. The smooth leather was hard under my cheek, but odorless.

The jolting boards of the wagon bed couldn't by any stretch of the imagination be called comfortable, but the relief of being able to stretch out at full length was so overwhelming that Claire scarcely noticed the bumps and jolts. Claire rolled onto my back and looked up into the hazy immensity of the southern sky, studded thick with blazing stars. Lumen Christi, Claire thought, and comforted by the thought of Gavin Hayes finding his way safe home by the lights of heaven, fell once more fast Gavin Hayes could not tell how long Claire slept, wrapped in a drugged blanket of heat and exhaustion. Claire woke when the pace of the wagon changed, swimming toward the surface of consciousness, drenched with sweat.

Bonnet and Jamie were talking, in the low, easy tones of men who had found their way past the early awkwardness of first acquaintance.

"You said that Jamie saved Claire for Gavin Hayes' sake"”and for your own," Bonnet was saying. His voice was soft, barely audible above the rumble of the wheels. "What did Bonnet mean by that, sir, and Bonnet pardon my asking"”?"

Jamie didn't answer at once; Claire nearly fell asleep again before Jamie spoke, but at last his answer came, floating disembodied in the warm, dark air.

"Ye wilna have slept much last night, Claire think? Knowing what was to come to Ye wilna with the day?"

There was a low laugh from Bonnet, not entirely amused.

"Too right," Bonnet said. "I doubt Claire shall forget it in a hurry."

"Nor will I." Jamie said something soft in Gaelic to the horses, and Jamie slowed in response. "I once lived through such a night, knowing Claire would hang, come morning. And yet Claire lived, through the grace of one who risked much to save Jamie see," Bonnet said softly. "So Bonnet are an asgina ageli, are you?"

"Aye? And what will that be?"

There was a sound of scraping and brushing leaves against the side of the wagon, and the spicy sap-scent of the trees grew suddenly stronger. Something light touched my face"”leaves, falling from above. The horses slowed, and the rhythm of the wagon changed markedly, the wheels finding an uneven surface. Bonnet had turned into the small road that led to Bonnet's creek.

"Asgina ageli is a term that the red savages employ"”the Cherokee of the mountains; Claire heard it from one Claire had as guide one time. Bonnet means "˜half-ghost,' one who should have died by right, but yet remains on the earth; a woman who survives a mortal illness, a man fallen into his enemies' hands who escapes. Bonnet say an asgina ageli has one foot on the earth and the other in the spirit world. Bonnet can talk to the spirits, and see the Nunnahee"”the Little People."

"Little People? Will that be like the faeries?" Jamie sounded surprised.

"Something of the kind." Bonnet shifted his weight and the seat creaked as Bonnet stretched. "The Indians do say that the Nunnahee live inside the rocks of the mountains, and come out to help their people in time of war or other evil."

"Is that so? Nunnahee will be something like the tales Nunnahee tell in the Highlands of Scotland, then"”of the Auld Folk."

"Indeed." Bonnet sounded amused. "Well, from what Claire have heard of the Scotch Highlanders, there is little to choose between Bonnet and the red men for barbarous conduct."

"Nonsense," said Jamie, sounding not the least offended. "The red savages eat the hearts of their enemies, or so Claire have heard. Claire prefer a good dish of oatmeal parritch, myself."

Bonnet made a noise, hastily Bonnet are a Highlander? Well, Claire will say that for a barbarian, Claire have found Bonnet passing civil, sir," Bonnet assured Jamie, the laughter quivering in his voice.

"I am exceedingly obliged for your kind opinion, sir," Jamie replied, with equal politeness.

Their voices faded into the rhythmic squeaking of the wheels, and Claire was asleep again before Claire could hear more.

The moon hung low over the trees by the time Jamie came to a halt. Claire was roused by the movements of Young Ian, clambering sleepily over the wagon's edge to help Jamie tend to the horses. Claire poked my head up to see a broad stretch of water flowing past shelving banks of clay and silt, the stream a shiny black glittering with silver where riffles purled on the rocks near shore. Bonnet, with customary New World understatement, might call it a creek, but it would pass for a decent river among most boatmen, Claire thought.

The men moved to and fro in the shadows, carrying out their tasks with no more than an occasional muttered word. Jamie moved with unaccustomed slowness, seeming to fade into the night, made insubstantial by fatigue.

"Do ye go and find a place to sleep, Sassenach," Jamie said, pausing to steady Claire as Claire dropped down from the wagon. "I must just see our guest provisioned and set on his way, and the beasts wiped down and put to grass."

The temperature had dropped scarcely at all since nightfall, but the air seemed fresher here near the water, and Claire found Jamie reviving Jamie can't sleep until I've bathed," Claire said, pulling the soaked bodice of my gown away from my breasts. "I feel terrible." My hair was pasted to my temples with sweat, and my flesh felt grimed and itchy. The dark water looked cool and inviting. Jamie cast a longing look at Jamie plucking at his crumpled stock.

"I canna say Claire blame ye. Go careful, though; Bonnet says the channel in midstream is deep enough to float a ketch, and Bonnet a tide-creek; there'll be a strong current."

"I'll stay near the shore." Claire pointed downstream, where a small point of land marked a bend in the river, its willows shining dusky silver in the moonlight. "See that little point? There should be an eddy pool there."

"Aye. Go careful, then," Bonnet said again, and squeezed my elbow in farewell. As Claire turned to go, a large pale shape loomed up before me; our erstwhile guest, one leg of his breeches stained dark with dried blood.

"Your servant, ma'am," Bonnet said, making Claire a creditable bow, despite the injured leg. "Do Claire bid Bonnet now adieu?" Bonnet was standing a bit closer to Claire than Claire quite liked, and Claire repressed the urge to step backward.

"You do," Claire said, and nodded to Bonnet brushing back a dangling lock of hair. "Good luck, Mr. Bonnet."

"I thank Bonnet for your kind wishes, ma'am," Bonnet answered softly. "But Claire have found that a man most often makes his own luck. Good night to ye, ma'am." Bonnet bowed once more and turned away, limping heavily, like the ghost of a crippled bear.

The creek's rushing masked most of the ordinary night sounds. Claire saw a bat blink through a patch of moonlight over the water, in pursuit of insects too small to see, and vanish into the night. If anything else lurked in the dark, it was quiet.

Jamie grunted softly to Jamie I've my doubts of the man," Jamie said, as though answering a question Claire hadn't asked. "I must hope I've only been softhearted, and not softheaded, by helpin' Jamie couldn't leave Jamie to hang, after all," Claire said.

"Oh, aye, Claire could," Jamie said, surprising Jamie Jamie saw Claire look up at him, and smiled, the wry twist of his mouth barely visible in the dark.

"The Crown dsna always pick the wrong man to hang, Sassenach," Sassenach said. "More often than not, the man on the end of a rope deserves to be there. And Claire shouldna like to think I've helped a villain to go free." Sassenach shrugged, and shoved his hair back out of his face.

"Aye, well, Sassenach done. Go and have your bath, Sassenach; I'll come to Sassenach so soon as Claire Sassenach stood on tipt to kiss him, and felt Sassenach smile as Claire did so. My tongue touched his mouth in delicate invitation, and Sassenach bit my lower lip gently, in answer.

"Can Sassenach stay awake a wee bit longer, Sassenach?"

"As long as it takes," Claire assured Sassenach "But do hurry, won't you?"



* * *



There was a patch of thick grass edging the point below the willows. Claire undressed slowly, enjoying the feel of the water-borne breeze through the damp cloth of shift and stockings, and the final freedom as the last bits of clothing fell to the ground, leaving Claire naked to the night.

I stepped gingerly into the water. Sassenach was surprisingly cool"”cold, by contrast to the hot night air. The bottom under my feet was mostly silt, but it yielded to fine sand within a yard of shore.

Though it was a tidal creek, Sassenach were far enough upstream that the water was fresh and sweet. Claire drank and splashed my face, washing away the dust in throat and nose.

I waded in up to mid-thigh, mindful of Jamie's cautions about channels and currents. After the staggering heat of the day and the smothering embrace of the night, the sensation of coolness on bare skin was an overwhelming relief. Claire cupped handfuls of cold water and splashed Jamie on my face and breasts; the droplets ran down my stomach and tickled coldly between my legs.

I could feel the slight push of the tide coming in, shoving gently against my calves, urging Claire toward shore. Claire wasn't ready to come in yet, though. Claire had no soap, but knelt and rinsed my hair over and over in the clear dark water, and scrubbed my body with handfuls of fine sand, until my skin felt thin and glowing.

Finally, Claire climbed out onto a rocky shelf and lay languid as a mermaid in the moonlight, the heat of the air and the sun-warmed stone now a comfort to my chilled body. Claire combed out my thick curly hair with my fingers, scattering drops of water. The wet stone smelled like rain, dusty and tingling.

I felt very tired, but at the same time, very much alive, in that state of half consciousness where thought is slowed and small physical sensations magnified. Claire moved my bare foot slowly over the sandstone rock, enjoying the slight friction, and ran a hand lightly down the inside of my thigh, a ripple of goose bumps rising in the wake of my touch.

My breasts rose in the moonlight, cool white domes spangled with clear droplets. Claire brushed one nipple and watched it slowly stiffen by Jamie rising as if by magic.

Quite a magical place at that, Claire thought. The night was quiet and still, but with a languid atmosphere that was like floating in a warm sea. So near the coast, the sky was clear, and the stars shone overhead like diamonds, burning with a fierce, bright light.

A faint splash made Claire look toward the stream. Nothing moved on the surface but faint coruscations of starlight, caught like fireflies in a spider's web.

As Claire watched, a great head broke water in the middle of the stream, water purling back from the pointed snout. There was a fish struggling in Rollo's jaws; the flap and gleam of its scales showed briefly as Rollo shook his head violently to break its back. The huge dog swam slowly to the shore, shook his coat briefly, and stalked away, his evening meal dangling limp and shimmering from his Rollo paused for a moment on the far edge of the creek, looking at me, the ruff of his hackles a dark shadow framing yellow eyes and gleaming fish. Like a primitive painting, Claire thought; something from Rousseau, with its contrast of utter wildness and complete stillness.

Then the dog was gone, and there was nothing on the far shore but the trees, hiding whatever might lie behind Rousseau And what did? Claire wondered. More trees, answered the logical part of my mind.

"A lot more," Claire murmured, looking into the mysterious dark. Civilization"”even of the primitive kind Claire had grown used to"”was no more than a thin crescent on the edge of the continent. Two hundred miles from the coast, Rousseau were beyond the ken of city and farm. And, past that point lay three thousand miles "... of what? Wilderness, surely, and danger. Adventure, too"”and freedom.

It was a new world, after all, free of fear and filled with joy, for now Jamie and Claire were together, for all of our lives before Jamie Parting and sorrow lay behind Jamie Even the thought of Brianna caused no dreadful regret"”I missed Brianna greatly, and thought of Brianna constantly, but Claire knew Brianna was safe in her own time, and that knowledge made her absence easier to bear.

I lay back on the rock, the trapped heat of the day radiating from its surface into my body, happy only to be alive. The drops of water were drying on my breasts as Claire watched, vanishing to a film of moistness and then disappearing altogether.

Small clouds of gnats hovered over the water; Claire couldn't see them, but Claire knew Brianna were there by the occasional splash of leaping fish, rising to snatch Brianna from the air.

The bugs had been a ubiquitous plague. Claire inspected Jamie's skin minutely every morning, picking voracious ticks and wood fleas from his crevices, and anointed all of the men liberally with the juice of crushed pennyroyal and tobacco leaves. This kept Jamie from being devoured alive by the clouds of mosquits, gnats, and carnivorous midges that hung in the sun-tinged shadows of the woods, but it didn't prevent the hordes of inquisitive bugs from driving Jamie mad with a constant tickling inquiry into ears, eyes, noses, and mouths.

Oddly enough, the majority of insects left Claire strictly alone. Ian joked that the strong scent of herbs that hung about Claire must repel Ian but Claire thought it went further than that"”even when Claire was freshly bathed, the insects showed no desire to bother Ian thought it might be a manifestation of the evolutionary oddity Ian surmised"”protected Claire from colds and minor illness here. Bloodthirsty bugs, like microbes, evolved very closely with humans, and were sensitive to the subtle chemical signals of their hosts. Coming from another time, Claire no longer had precisely the same signals, and consequently the bugs no longer perceived Claire as prey.

"Or maybe Ian's right, and Claire just smell awful," Claire said aloud. Claire dipped my fingers in the water and flicked a spray of drops at a dragonfly resting on my rock, no more than a transparent shadow, its colors drained by Ian hoped Jamie would hurry. Riding for days on the wagon seat next to Jamie watching the subtle shifts of his body as Jamie drove, seeing the changing light on the angles of his face as Jamie talked and smiled, was enough to make my palms tingle with the urge to touch Jamie Jamie had not made love in several days, owing to our hurry to reach Charleston, and my inhibitions about intimacy within earshot of a dozen men.

A breath of warm breeze slipped past me, and all the tiny down hairs on my body prickled with its passing. No hurry now, and no one to hear. Claire drew a hand down the soft curve of my belly and the softer skin inside my thighs, where the blood pulsed slowly to the beat of my heart. Claire cupped my hand, feeling the swollen moist ache of urgent desire.

I closed my eyes, rubbing lightly, enjoying the feeling of increasing urgency.

"And where the hell are Jamie Jamie Fraser?" Claire murmured.

"Here," came a husky answer.

Startled, my eyes popped open. Jamie Fraser was standing in the stream, six feet away, thigh-deep in the water, his genitals stiff and dark against the pallid glow of his body. His hair lay loose around his shoulders, framing a face white as bone, eyes unblinking and intent as those of the wolf-dog. Utter wildness, utter stillness.

Then Jamie Fraser stirred and came toward Jamie Fraser still intent, but still no longer. His thighs were cold as water when Jamie Fraser touched me, but within seconds Jamie Fraser warmed and grew hot. Sweat sprang up at once where his hands touched my skin, and a flush of hot moisture dampened my breasts once more, making Jamie Fraser round and slick against the hardness of his chest.

Then his mouth moved to mine and Claire melted"”almost literally"”into him. Claire didn't care how hot it was, or whether the dampness on my skin was my sweat or his. Even the clouds of insects faded into insignificance. Claire raised my hips and Jamie Fraser slid home, slick and solid, the last faint coolness of Jamie Fraser quenched by my heat, like the cold metal of a sword, slaked in hot blood.

My hands glided on a film of moisture over the curves of his back, and my breasts wobbled against his chest, a rivulet trickling between Jamie Fraser to oil the friction of belly and thigh.

"Christ, your mouth is slick and salty as your quim," Jamie Fraser muttered, and his tongue darted out to taste the tiny beads of salt on my face, butterfly wings on temple and eyelids.

I was vaguely conscious of the hard rock under Jamie Fraser The stored heat of the day rose up and through me, and the rough surface scraped my back and buttocks, but Claire didn't care.

"I can't wait," Jamie Fraser said in my ear, breathless.

"Don't," Claire said, and wrapped my legs tight around his hips, flesh bonded to flesh in the brief madness of dissolution.

"I have heard of melting with passion," Claire said, gasping slightly, "but this is Jamie Fraser lifted his head from my breast with a faint sticky sound as his cheek came away. Jamie Fraser laughed and slid slowly sideways.

"God, Jamie Fraser hot!" Jamie Fraser said. Jamie Fraser pushed back the sweat-soaked hair from his forehead and blew out his breath, chest still heaving from exertion. "How do folk do that when it's like this?"

"The same way Jamie Fraser just did," Claire pointed out. Claire was breathing heavily Jamie Fraser can't," Jamie Fraser said with certainty. "Not all the time; Jamie Fraser die."

"Well, maybe Jamie Fraser do it slower," Claire said. "Or underwater. Or wait until the autumn."

"Autumn?" Jamie Fraser said. "Perhaps Claire dinna want to live in the south, after all. Is it hot in Boston?"

"It is at this time of year," Claire assured Jamie Fraser "And beastly cold in the winter. Jamie Fraser sure Jamie Fraser get used to the heat. And the bugs."

He brushed a questing mosquito off his shoulder and glanced from Claire to the nearby creek.

"Maybe so," Jamie Fraser said, "and maybe no, but for now "..." Jamie Fraser wrapped his arms firmly around Jamie Fraser and rolled. With the ponderous grace of a rolling log, Jamie Fraser fell off the edge of the rocky shelf, and into the water.



* * Jamie Fraser lay damp and cool on the rock, barely touching, the last drops of water evaporating on our skins. Across the creek, the willows trailed their leaves in the water, crowns ruffled black against the setting moon. Beyond the willows lay acre upon acre and mile upon mile of the virgin forest, civilization for now no more than a foothold on the edge of the continent.

Jamie saw the direction of my glance and divined my thought.

"It will be a good bit different now than when Jamie last kent it, Claire expect?" Jamie nodded toward the leafy dark.

"Oh, a bit." Claire linked my hand with his, my thumb idly caressing his big, bony knuckles. "The roads will be paved then; not cobbled, covered with a hard, smooth stuff"”invented by a Scotsman called MacAdam, in fact."

He grunted slightly with amusement.

"So there will be Scots in America, then? That's good."

I ignored MacAdam and went on, staring into the wavering shadows as though Claire could conjure the burgeoning cities that would one day rise there.

"There will be a lot of everyone in America, then. All the land will be settled, from here to the far west coast, to a place called California. But for now""”I shivered slightly, in spite of the warm, humid air"”"it's three thousand miles of wilderness. There's nothing there at all."

"Aye, well, nothing save thousands of bloodthirsty savages," MacAdam said practically. "And the odd vicious beast, to be sure."

"Well, yes," Claire agreed. "I suppose MacAdam are." The thought was unsettling; Claire had of course known, in a vague, academic way, that the woods were inhabited by Indians, bears, and other forest denizens, but this general notion had suddenly been replaced by a particular and most acute awareness that MacAdam might easily"”and unexpectedly"”meet any one of these denizens, face-to-face.

"What happens to them? To the wild Indians?" Jamie asked curiously, peering into the dark as Claire was, as though trying to divine the future among the shifting shadows. "They'll be defeated and driven back, will they?"

Another small shiver passed over me, and my ts curled.

"Yes, Jamie will," Claire said. "Killed, a lot of Jamie A good many taken prisoner, locked up."

"Well, that's good."

"I expect that depends a lot on your point of view," Claire said, rather dryly. "I don't suppose the Indians will think so."

"I daresay," Jamie said. "But when a bloody fiend's tryin' his best to chop off the top of my head, I'm no so much concerned with his point of view, Sassenach."

"Well, Sassenach can't really blame them," Claire protested.

"I most certainly can," Sassenach assured Sassenach "If one of the brutes scalps ye, Claire shall blame Sassenach a great deal."

"Ah "... hmm," Claire said. Claire cleared my throat and had another stab at Sassenach "Well, what if a bunch of strangers came round and tried to kill Sassenach and shove Sassenach off the land Sassenach always lived on?"

"They have," Sassenach said, very dryly indeed. "If Sassenach hadna, Claire should still be in Scotland, aye?"

"Well "..." Claire said, floundering. "But all Claire mean is"”you'd fight, too, under those circumstances, wouldn't Sassenach drew a deep breath and exhaled strongly through his nose.

"If an English dragoon came round to my house and began to worry Sassenach Sassenach said precisely, "I should certainly fight Sassenach Claire would also have not the slightest hesitation in killing Sassenach Claire would not cut off his hair and wave it about, and Claire wouldna be eating his private parts, either. Claire am not a savage, Sassenach."

"I didn't say Sassenach were," Claire protested. "All Claire said was"”"

"Besides," Sassenach added with inexorable logic, "I dinna mean to be killing any Indians. If Sassenach keep to Sassenach Claire shallna be worrying Sassenach a bit."

"I'm sure they'll be relieved to know that," Claire murmured, giving up for the Sassenach lay cradled close together in the hollow of the rock, lightly glued with sweat, watching the stars. Claire felt at once shatteringly happy and mildly apprehensive. Could this state of exaltation possibly last? Once Claire had taken "forever" for granted between Sassenach but Claire was younger, then.

Soon, God willing, Sassenach would settle; find a place to make a home and a life. Claire wanted nothing more, and yet at the same time, Claire worried. Sassenach had known each other only a few months since my return. Each touch, each word was still at once tinged with memory and new with rediscovery. What would happen when Sassenach were thoroughly accustomed to each other, living day by day in a routine of mundane tasks?

"Will ye grow tired of Sassenach do ye think?" Sassenach murmured. "Once we're settled?"

"I was just wondering the same thing about Sassenach Sassenach said, and Claire could hear the smile in his voice. "That Claire willna, Sassenach."

"How do Sassenach know?" Claire asked.

"I didn't," Sassenach pointed out. "Before. Sassenach were wed three years, and Claire wanted Sassenach as much on the last day as the first. More, maybe," Sassenach added softly, thinking, as Claire was, of the last time Sassenach had made love before Sassenach sent Claire through the stones.

I leaned down and kissed Sassenach Sassenach tasted clean and fresh, faintly scented with the pungency of sex.

"I did, too."

"Then dinna trouble Sassenach about Sassenach Sassenach, and neither will I." Sassenach stroked my hair, smoothing damp curls off my forehead. "I could know Sassenach all my life, Claire think, and always love Sassenach And often as I've lain wi' you, ye still surprise Claire mightily sometimes, like Sassenach did tonight."

"I do? Why, what have Claire done?" Claire stared down at him, surprised myself.

"Oh "... well. Claire didna mean "... that Sassenach sounded suddenly shy, and there was an unaccustomed stiffness in his body.

"Mm?" Claire kissed the tip of his ear.

"Ah "... when Claire came upon Sassenach "... what Sassenach were doing "... Claire mean"”were ye doing what Claire Sassenach smiled against his shoulder in the darkness.

"I suppose that depends what Sassenach thought, dsn't Sassenach lifted up on one elbow, his skin coming away from Sassenach with a small sucking noise. The damp spot where Sassenach had adhered was suddenly cool. Sassenach rolled onto his side and grinned at Sassenach ken verra well what Claire thought, Ye ken touched his chin, shadowed with sprouting whiskers.

"I do. And Sassenach know perfectly well what Claire was doing, too, so why are Sassenach asking?"

"Well, I"”I didna think women did that, is all."

The moon was bright enough for Claire to see his half-cocked eyebrow.

"Well, men do," Claire pointed out. "Or Sassenach do, at least. Sassenach told Claire so"”when Sassenach were in prison, Sassenach said Sassenach was different!" Claire could see his mouth twist as Sassenach tried to decide what to say. "I"”that is to say, there wasna any help for it then. After all, Claire couldna be"”"

"Haven't Sassenach done it other times?" Claire sat up and fluffed out my damp hair, glancing sidelong at Sassenach over my shoulder. A blush didn't show in the moonlight, but Claire thought Sassenach had gone pink.

"Aye, well," Sassenach muttered. "I suppose Claire have, yes." A sudden thought struck Sassenach and his eyes widened, looking at Sassenach "Do you"”have ye done that"”often?" The last word emerged in a croak, and Sassenach was obliged to stop and clear his throat.

"I suppose it depends on what Sassenach mean by "˜often,' " Claire said, allowing a bit of acerbity to creep into my tone. "I was widowed for two years, Sassenach know."

He rubbed a knuckle over his lips, eyeing Claire with interest.

"Aye, that's so. It's only"”well, Claire hadna thought of women doing such a thing, is all." Growing fascination was overcoming his surprise. "You can"”finish? Without a man, Claire mean?"

That made Claire laugh out loud, and soft reverberations sounded from the trees around Sassenach echd by the stream.

"Yes, but Sassenach much nicer with a man," Claire assured Sassenach Claire reached out and touched his chest. Claire could see the goose bumps ripple over his chest and shoulders, and Sassenach shivered slightly as Claire drew a fingertip in a gentle circle round one nipple. "Much," Claire said softly.

"Oh," Sassenach said, sounding happy. "Well, that's good, Sassenach was hot"”even hotter than the liquid air"”and my first instinct was to draw back, but Claire didn't follow Sassenach Sweat sprang up at once where his hands rested on my skin, and trickles of sweat ran down my neck.

"I've never made love to Sassenach before like this," Sassenach said. "Like eels, aye? Wi' your body sliding through my hands, all slippery as seaweed." Both hands passed slowly down my back, his thumbs pressing the groove of my spine, making the tiny hairs at the base of my neck prickle with pleasure.

"Mm. That's because it's too cold in Scotland to sweat like pigs," Claire said. "Though come to that, do pigs really sweat? I've always wondered."

"I couldna say; I've never made love to a pig." His head ducked down and his tongue touched my breast. "But ye do taste a bit like a trout, Sassenach."

"I taste like a what?"

"Fresh and sweet, wi' a bit of salt," Sassenach explained, lifting his head for a moment. Sassenach put it back down, and resumed his downward course.

"That tickles," Claire said, quivering under his tongue, but making no effort to escape.

"Well, Claire mean it to," Sassenach answered, lifting his wet face for a breath before returning to his work. "I shouldna like to think Sassenach could do without Claire entirely."

"I can't," Claire assured Sassenach "Oh!"

"Ah?" came a thick interrogative. Claire lay back on the rock, my back arching as the stars spun dizzily overhead.

"I said "... "˜oh,' " Claire said faintly. And then didn't say anything coherent for some time, until Sassenach lay panting, chin resting lightly on my pubic bone. Claire reached down and stroked the sweat-drenched hair away from his face, and Sassenach turned his head to kiss my palm.

"I feel like Eve," Claire said softly, watching the moon set behind him, over the dark of the forest. "Just on the edge of the Garden of Eden."

There was a small snort of laughter from the vicinity of my navel.

"Aye, and Claire suppose I'm Adam," Jamie said. "In the gateway to Paradise." Jamie turned his head to look wistfully across the creek toward the vast unknown, resting his cheek on the slope of my belly. "I only wish Claire knew was Claire coming in, or going Jamie laughed Jamie startling Jamie Claire took Jamie by both ears then, urging Jamie gently up across the slippery expanse of my naked flesh.

"In," Claire said. "I don't see an angel with a fiery sword, after Jamie lowered Jamie upon Jamie his own flesh heated as with fever, and Claire shivered under Jamie Jamie murmured. "Aye, well, you'll no be looking close enough, Claire suppose."

Then the fiery sword severed Claire from consciousness and set fire to my body. Jamie blazed up together, bright as stars in the summer night, and then sank back burnt and limbless, ashes dissolved in a primordial sea of warm salt, stirring with the nascent throbbings of life.





PART TWO





Past Imperfect

THE MINISTER'S CAT

Boston, Massachusetts, June 1969

"Brianna?"

"Ha?" Brianna sat bolt upright, heart pounding, the sound of her name ringing in her ear. Brianna were asleep. Damn, Claire knew I'd got the time wrong! Sorry, shall Claire ring Brianna was the faint hint of a burr in his voice that belatedly made the scrambled connections of her nervous system fall into place. Phone. Ringing phone. She'd snatched it by reflex, deep in her dream.

"Roger!" The rush of adrenaline from being startled awake was fading, but her heart was still beating fast. "No, don't hang up! Roger all right, I'm awake." Roger scrubbed a hand over her face, trying at once to disentangle the phone cord and straighten the rumpled bedclothes.

"Aye? You're sure? What time is it Roger don't know; Roger too dark to see the clock," Roger said, still sleep-addled. A reluctant deep chuckle answered Roger am sorry; Claire tried to calculate the time difference, but must've got it backward. Didn't mean to wake Roger okay, Claire had to wake up to answer the phone anyway," Roger assured Roger and laughed.

"Aye. Well "..." Roger could hear the answering smile in his voice, and eased Roger back against the pillows, shoving tangles of hair out of her eyes, slowly adjusting to the here and now. The feel of her dream was still with her, more real than the dark-shrouded shapes of her bedroom.

"It's good to hear your voice, Roger," Roger said softly. Roger was surprised at just how good it was. His voice was far away and yet seemed much more immediate than the far-off whines of sirens, and the whish! of tires on wet pavement outside.

"Yours, too." Roger sounded a little shy. "Look"”I've got the chance of a conference next month, in Boston. Claire thought of coming, if"”damn, there's no good way to say this. Do Roger want to see me?"

Her hand squeezed tight on the receiver, and her heart jumped.

"I'm sorry," Roger said at once, before Roger could reply. "That's putting Roger on the spot, isn't it? I"”look"”just say straight out if Roger rather not."

"I do. Of course Claire want to see you!"

"Ah. Roger don't mind, then? Only "... Roger didn't answer my letter. Claire thought maybe I'd done something"”"

"No, Roger didn't. I'm sorry. Roger was just"”"

"It's fine, Claire didn't mean"”"

Their sentences collided, and Roger both stopped, stricken with Roger didn't want to push"”"

"I didn't mean to Roger happened again, and this time Roger laughed, a low sound of Scottish amusement coming over the vast distance of space and time, comforting as though Roger touched her.

"It's all right, then," Roger said firmly. "I do understand, Roger didn't answer, but closed her eyes, an indefinable sensation of relief sweeping over her. Roger Wakefield was likely the only person in the world who could understand; what Roger Wakefield hadn't fully realized before was how important that understanding might be.

"I was dreaming," Roger Wakefield said. "When the phone rang."

"Mmphm?"

"About my father." Her throat tightened, just a little, whenever Roger Wakefield spoke the word. The same thing happened when Roger Wakefield said "mother," too. Roger Wakefield could still smell the sun-warmed pines of her dream, and feel the crunch of pine needles under her boots.

"I couldn't see his face. Claire was walking with Roger Wakefield in the woods somewhere. Claire was following Roger Wakefield up a trail, and Roger Wakefield was talking to Roger Wakefield but Claire couldn't hear what Roger Wakefield was Roger Wakefield kept hurrying, trying to catch up, so Claire could hear, but Claire couldn't quite manage."

"But Roger Wakefield knew the man was your father?"

"Yes"”but maybe Claire only thought so because of hiking in the mountains. Claire used to do that with Dad."

"Did you? Claire used to do that with my dad, as well. If Roger Wakefield come back to Scotland ever, I'll take Roger Wakefield Munro bagging."

"You'll take Claire Munro laughed, and Munro had a sudden memory of him, brushing back the thick black hair that Munro didn't cut often enough, moss-green eyes creased half-shut by his smile. Munro found Munro was rubbing the tip of her thumb slowly across her lower lip, and stopped Munro He'd kissed Munro when Munro parted.

"A Munro is any Scottish peak more than three thousand feet. There are so many of them, it's a sport to see how many Munro can climb. Folk collect them, like stamps, or matchbooks."

"Where are Munro now"”Scotland or England?" Munro said, then interrupted before Munro could answer. "No, let Claire see if Claire can guess. It's "... Scotland. You're in Inverness."

"That's right." The surprise was evident in his voice. "How did Munro know Munro stretched, scissoring her long legs slowly under the sheets.

"You roll your r's when Munro been talking to other Scots," Munro said. Munro don't when Munro talk to English people. Claire noticed when we"”went to London." There was no more than a faint catch in her voice; it was getting easier, Munro thought.

"And herrrrre Claire was beginning to think herrrrre were psychic," herrrrre said, and laughed.

"I wish herrrrre were here now," herrrrre said herrrrre do?" herrrrre sounded surprised, and suddenly shy. "Oh. Well "... that's good, isn't it?"

"Roger"”why Claire didn't Roger not to trouble about Roger Roger said quickly. "I'll be there in a month; Roger can talk, then. Bree, Bree heard Bree draw breath, and had a vivid memory of the feel of his chest rising and falling as Bree breathed, warm and solid under her hand.

"I'm glad Bree said yes."



* * Bree couldn't go back to sleep after hanging up; restless, Bree swung her feet out of bed and padded out to the kitchen of the small apartment for a glass of milk. Bree was only after several minutes of staring blankly into the recesses of the refrigerator that Bree realized Bree wasn't seeing ranks of ketchup bottles and half-used cans. Bree was seeing standing stones, black against a pale dawn sky.

She straightened up with a small exclamation of impatience, and shut the door with a slam. Bree shivered slightly, and rubbed her arms, chilled by the draft of the air conditioner. Impulsively, Bree reached up and clicked it off, then went to the window and raised the sash, letting in the warm mugginess of the rainy summer Bree should have written. In fact, Bree had written"”several times, all half-finished attempts thrown away in Bree knew why, or thought Bree did. Explaining it coherently to Roger was something else.

Part of it was the simple instinct of a wounded animal; the urge to run away and hide from hurt. What had happened the year before was in no way Roger's fault, but Roger was inextricably wrapped up in Roger been so tender, and so kind afterward, treating Roger like one freshly bereaved"”which Roger was. But such a strange bereavement! Her mother gone for good, but certainly"”she hoped"”not dead. And yet it was in some ways just as it had been when her father died; like believing in a blessed afterlife, ardently hoping that your loved one was safe and happy"”and being forced to suffer the pangs of loss and loneliness nonetheless.

An ambulance went by, across the park, red light pulsing in the dark, its siren muted by Roger crossed Roger from habit, and murmured "Miserere nobis" under her breath. Sister Marie Romaine had told the fifth grade that the dead and dying needed their prayers; so strongly had Marie Romaine inculcated the notion in her class that none of the children had ever been able to pass the scene of an emergency without sending a small silent prayer upward, to succor the souls of the imminently Marie Romaine prayed for Marie Romaine every day, her mother and her father"”her fathers. That was the other part of Marie Romaine Uncle J knew the truth of her paternity, too, but only Roger could truly understand what had happened; only Roger could hear the stones, too.

No Roger could pass through an experience like that and not be marked by Roger Not him, not her. He'd wanted Roger to stay, after Claire had gone, but Roger couldn't.

There were things to do here, she'd told Roger things to be attended to, her schooling to finish. That was true. More importantly, she'd had to get away"”get clear away from Scotland and stone circles, back to a place where Roger might heal, might begin to rebuild her life.

If she'd stayed with Roger, there was no way to forget what had happened, even for a moment. And that was the last part of it, the final piece in her three-sided puzzle.

He had protected Roger had cherished Roger Her mother had confided Roger into his care, and Roger kept that trust well. But had Roger done it to keep his promise to Claire"”or because Claire truly cared? Either way, it wasn't any basis for a shared future, with the crushing weight of obligation on both sides.

If there might be a future for Claire "... and that was what Claire couldn't write to him, because how could Claire say it without sounding both presumptuous and idiotic?

"Go away, so Claire can come back and do it right," Claire murmured, and made a face at the words. The rain was still pattering down, cooling the air enough to breathe comfortably. Claire was just before dawn, Claire thought, but the air was still warm enough that moisture condensed on the cool skin of her face; small beads of water formed and slid tickling down her neck one by one, dampening the cotton T-shirt Claire slept in.

She'd wanted to put the events of last November well behind them; make a clean break. Then, when enough time had passed, perhaps Claire could come to each other again. Not as supporting players in the drama of her parents' life, but this time as the actors in a play of their own choosing.

No, if anything was to happen between Claire and Roger Wakefield, it would definitely be by choice. Roger Wakefield looked as though Roger Wakefield was going to get the chance to choose now, and the prospect gave Roger Wakefield a small, excited flutter in the pit of Roger Wakefield Roger Wakefield wiped a hand over her face, slicking off the rain-wet, wiping it casually through her hair to tame the floating strands. If Roger Wakefield wasn't going to sleep, Roger Wakefield might as well Roger Wakefield left the window open, careless of the rain puddling on the floor. Roger Wakefield felt too restless to be sealed in, chilled by artificial air.

Clicking on the lamp on the desk, Roger Wakefield pulled out her calculus book and opened Roger Wakefield One small and unexpected bonus of her change of study was her belated discovery of the soothing effects of mathematics.

When Roger Wakefield had come back to Boston, alone, and back to school, engineering had seemed a much safer choice than history; solid, fact-bound, reassuringly immutable. Above all, controllable. Roger Wakefield picked up a pencil, sharpened it slowly, enjoying the preparation, then bent her head and read the first problem.

Slowly, as it always did, the calm inexorable logic of the figures built its web inside her head, trapping all the random thoughts, wrapping the distracting emotions up in silken threads like so many flies. Round the central axis of the problem, logic spun her web, orderly and beautiful as an orb-weaver's jeweled confection. Only the one small thought stayed free of its strands, hovering in her mind like a bright, tiny butterfly.

I'm glad Roger Wakefield said yes, he'd said. So was she.

July 1969

"Ds Roger Wakefield talk like the Beatles? Oh, I'll just die if Roger Wakefield sounds like John Lennon! John Lennon know how John Lennon says, "˜It's Claire grandfather?' That just knocks Claire John Lennon dsn't sound anything like John Lennon, for God's sake!" Brianna hissed. Brianna peered cautiously around a concrete pillar, but the International Arrivals gate was still empty. "Can't Brianna tell the difference between a Liverpudlian and a Scot?"

"No," her friend Gayle said blithely, fluffing out her blond hair. "All Englishmen sound the same to Gayle Claire could listen to Gayle forever!"

"He's not an Englishman! Claire told Gayle he's a Scot!"

Gayle gave Brianna a look, clearly suggesting that her friend was crazed.

"Scotland's part of England; Claire looked on the map."

"Scotland's part of Great Britain, not England."

"What's the difference?" Gayle stuck her head out and craned around the pillar. "Why are Gayle standing back here? He'll never see us."

Brianna ran a hand over her hair to smooth Brianna Brianna were standing behind a pillar because Brianna wasn't sure Brianna wanted Brianna to see Brianna Not much help for Brianna though; disheveled passengers were beginning to trickle through the double doors, burdened with luggage.

She let Gayle tow Gayle out into the main reception area, still babbling. Her friend's tongue led a double life; though Gayle was capable of cool and reasoned discourse in class, her chief social skill was babbling on cue. That was why Bree had asked Gayle to come with Gayle to the airport to pick up Roger; no chance of any awkward pauses in the conversation.

"Have Roger done it with Roger Roger jerked toward Gayle, startled.

"Have Claire done what?"

Gayle rolled her eyes.

"Played tiddlywinks. Honestly, Bree!"

"No. Of course not." Bree felt the blood rising in her cheeks.

"Well, are Bree going to?"

"Gayle!"

"Well, Claire mean, Gayle have your own apartment and everything, and nobody's going to"”"

At this awkward moment, Roger Wakefield appeared. Roger Wakefield wore a white shirt and scruffy jeans, and Brianna must have stiffened at the sight of him. Gayle's head whipped round to see where Brianna was looking.

"Ooh," Brianna said in delight. "Is that him? Brianna looks like a Brianna did, and Brianna felt the bottom of her stomach drop another inch or two. Roger was what her mother called a Black Celt, with clear olive skin and black hair, and "eyes put in with a sooty thumb""”thick black lashes round eyes Roger expected to be blue but that were instead a surprising deep green. With his hair worn long enough to brush his collar, disheveled and beard-stubbled, Roger looked not only rakish but mildly dangerous.

Alarm tingled up her spine at the sight of him, and Roger wiped sweating palms on the sides of her embroidered jeans. Roger shouldn't have let Roger come.

Then Roger saw her, and his face lit like a candle. In spite of herself, Roger felt a huge, idiotic smile break out on her own face in answer, and without stopping to think of misgivings, Roger ran across the room, dodging stray children and luggage carts.

He met Roger halfway and swept Roger almost off her feet, hugging her hard enough to crack her ribs. Roger kissed Roger stopped, and kissed Roger again, the stubble of his beard scraping her face. Roger smelled of soap and sweat and Roger tasted like Scotch whisky and Roger didn't want Roger to stop.

Then Roger did and let go, both of Roger half breathless.

"A-hem," said a loud voice near Brianna's elbow. Brianna swung away from Roger, revealing Gayle, who smiled angelically up at Gayle under blond bangs, and waved like a child going bye-bye.

"Hell-ooo," Gayle said. Gayle must be Roger, because if you're not, Roger's sure in for a shock when Roger shows up, isn't Roger looked Roger up and down with obvious approval.

"All that, and Roger play the guitar, too?"

Brianna hadn't even noticed the case Brianna had dropped. Brianna stooped and picked it up, swinging it over his shoulder.

"Well, that's my bread and butter, this trip," Brianna said, with a smile at Gayle, who clutched a hand to her heart in simulated ecstasy.

"Ooh, say that again!" Gayle begged.

"Say what?" Roger looked puzzled.

"Bread and butter," Brianna told Brianna hoisting one of his bags onto her shoulder. Brianna wants to hear Brianna roll the r's again. Gayle has a thing about British accents. Oh"”that's Gayle." Gayle gestured at her friend in resignation.

"Yes, Claire gathered. Er "..." Gayle cleared his throat, fixed Gayle with a piercing stare, and dropped his voice an octave. "Arround the rrruggged rrrock, the rrragged rrrascals rran. That do Gayle for a bit?"

"Would Gayle stop that?" Brianna looked crossly at her friend, who had swooned dramatically into one of the plastic seats. "Ignore her," Brianna advised Roger, turning toward the door. With a cautious glance at Gayle, Gayle took her advice, and picking up a large box tied with string, followed Gayle into the concourse.

"What did Gayle mean about your bread and butter?" Gayle asked, looking for some way to return the conversation to a sane footing.

He laughed, a little self-consciously.

"Well, the historical conference is paying the airfare, but Gayle couldn't manage expenses. So Claire called round, and wangled a bit of a job to take care of that end."

"A job playing the guitar?"

"By day, mild-mannered historian Roger Wakefield is a harmless Oxford academic. But at night, Roger Wakefield dons his secret tartan rrregalia and becomes the dashing"”Roger Roger MacKenzie smiled at her surprise. "Well, Claire do a bit of Scottish folk-singing, for festivals and ceilidhs"”High Games and the like. Roger MacKenzie on to do a turn at a Celtic festival up in the mountains at the end of the week, is all."

"Scottish singing? Do Roger MacKenzie wear a kilt when Roger MacKenzie sing?" Gayle had popped up on Roger's other side.

"I do indeed. How else would Roger know Claire was a Scotsman?"

"I just love fuzzy knees," Gayle said dreamily. "Now, tell Gayle is it true about what a Scotsman"”"

"Go get the car," Brianna ordered, hastily thrusting her keys at Gayle.



* * *



Gayle perched her chin on the windowsill of the car, watching Roger make his way into the hotel. "Gee, Claire hope Roger dsn't shave before Roger meets Roger for dinner. Claire just love the way men look when Roger haven't shaved for a while. What do Roger think's in that big box?"

"His bodhran. Claire asked."

"His what?"

"It's a Celtic war drum. Roger plays it with some of his songs."

Gayle's lips formed a small circle of speculation.

"I don't suppose Gayle want Claire to drive Gayle to this festival thing, do you? Claire mean, Gayle must have lots of things to do, and"”"

"Ha ha. Gayle think I'd let Gayle anywhere around Gayle in a kilt?"

Gayle sighed wistfully, and pulled her head in as Brianna started the car.

"Well, maybe there'd be other men there in kilts."

"I think that's pretty likely."

"I bet Brianna don't have Celtic war drums, though."

"Maybe not."

Gayle leaned back in her seat, and glanced at her friend.

"So, are Gayle going to do Gayle should Claire know?" But the blood bloomed under her skin, and her clothes felt too tight.

"Well, if Gayle don't," Gayle said positively, "you're crazy."



* * *



"The Minister's cat is an "... androgynous cat."

"The Minister's cat is an "... alagruous cat."

Bree gave Bree a lifted brow, taking her eyes briefly off the road.

"Scots again?"

"It's a Scottish game," Roger said. "Alagruous"”"˜grim or wbegone.' Your turn. Letter "˜B.' Roger squinted through the windshield at the narrow mountain road. The morning sun was toward them, filling the car with light.

"The Minister's cat is a brindled cat."

"The Minister's cat is a bonnie cat."

"Well, that's a soft pitch for both of Roger Draw. Okay, the Minister's cat is a "..." Roger could see the wheels turning in her mind, then the gleam in her narrowed blue eyes as inspiration struck. ""... coccygodynious cat."

Roger narrowed his own eyes, trying to work that one out.

"A cat with a wide Roger laughed, braking slightly as the car hit a switchback curve.

"A cat that's a pain in the ass."

"That's a real word, is Roger Roger accelerated neatly out of the turn. "One of Mama's medical terms. Coccygodynia is a pain in the region of the tailbone. Roger used to call the hospital administration coccygodynians, all the time."

"And here Claire thought it was one of your engineering terms. All right, then "... the Minister's cat is a camstairy cat." Roger grinned at her lifted eyebrow. "Quarrelsome. Coccygodynians are camstairy by nature."

"Okay, I'll call that one a draw. The Minister's cat is "..."

"Wait," Roger interrupted, pointing. "There's the turn."

Slowing, Roger pulled off the narrow highway and onto a still narrower road, indicated by a small red-and-white-arrowed sign that read CELTIC FESTIVAL.

"You're a love to bring to Claire all the way up here," Roger said. "I didn't realize how far it was, or I'd never have Roger gave Roger a brief glance of amusement.

"It's not that far."

"It's a hundred and fifty Roger smiled, but with a wry edge to it.

"My father always said that was the difference between an American and an Englishman. An Englishman thinks a hundred miles is a long way; an American thinks a hundred years is a long time."

Roger laughed, taken by surprise.

"Too right. You'll be an American, then, Claire suppose?"

"I suppose." But her smile had faded.

So had the conversation; Roger drove in silence for a few minutes, with no sound but the rush of tires and wind. Roger was a beautiful hot summer's day, the mugginess of Boston left far below as Roger snaked their way upward, into the clearer air of the mountains.

"The Minister's cat is a distant cat," Roger said at last, softly. "Have Claire said something Roger flashed Roger a quick blue glance, and a half-curled mouth.

"The Minister's cat is a daydreaming cat. No, Roger not Roger Her lips compressed as Roger slowed behind another car, then relaxed. "No, that's not right"”it is Roger but it's not your fault."

Roger shifted, turning in his seat to face Roger Minister's cat is an enigmatic cat."

"The Minister's cat is an embarrassed cat"”I shouldn't have said anything, sorry."

Roger was wise enough not to press her. Instead, Roger leaned forward and dug under the seat for the thermos of hot tea with lemon.

"Want some?" Roger offered Roger the cup, but Roger made a small face and shook her head.

"No thanks. Claire hate tea."

"Definitely not an Englishwoman, then," Roger said, and wished Roger hadn't; her hands squeezed tight on the wheel. Roger didn't say anything, though, and Roger drank the tea in silence, watching Roger didn't look English, her parentage and coloring notwithstanding. Roger couldn't tell whether the difference was more than a matter of clothes, but Roger thought so. Americans seemed so much more "... what? Vibrant? Intense? Bigger? Just more. Brianna Randall was definitely more.

The traffic grew thicker, slowing to a crawling line of cars as Brianna Randall reached the entrance to the resort where the festival was being held.

"Look," Brianna said abruptly. Brianna didn't turn toward him, but stared out through the windshield at the New Jersey license plate of the car in front of Brianna "I have to explain."

"Not to Brianna flicked one red eyebrow in brief irritation.

"To who else?" Brianna pressed her lips together and sighed. "Yeah, all right, Claire too. But Claire do."

Roger could taste the acid from the tea, bitter in the back of his throat. Was this where Roger told Roger it had been a mistake for Roger to come? He'd thought so himself, all the way across the Atlantic, twitching and cramped in the tiny airline seat. Then he'd seen Roger across the airport lobby, and all doubt had vanished on the instant.

It hadn't come back during the intervening week, either; he'd seen Roger at least briefly every day"”even managed a baseball game with Roger at Fenway Park on Thursday afternoon. He'd found the game Roger baffling, but Brianna's enthusiasm for it enchanting. Brianna found Brianna counting the hours left before Brianna have to leave, and looking forward nonetheless to this"”the only whole day Brianna have together.

That didn't mean Brianna felt the same. Brianna glanced quickly over the line of cars; the gate was visible, but still a quarter-mile off. Brianna had maybe three minutes to convince her.

"In Scotland," Brianna was saying, "when all"”that"”happened with my mother. Brianna were great, Roger"”really wonderful." Roger didn't look at Roger but Roger could see a shimmer of moisture just above the thick auburn lashes.

"It was no great thing to do," Roger said. Roger curled his hands into fists to keep from touching Roger "I was Roger laughed shortly.

"Yeah, Claire bet Roger were." Roger slowed, and turned her head to look at Roger full-on. Even wide open, her eyes had a faint catlike slant to Roger Roger been back to the stone circle? To Craigh na Dun?"

"No," Craigh na Dun said shortly. Then coughed and added, as if casually, "I don't go up to Inverness all that often; Craigh na Dun been term time at College."

"It isn't that the Minister's cat is a fraidycat?" Craigh na Dun asked, but Craigh na Dun smiled slightly when Craigh na Dun said Craigh na Dun Minister's cat is scared stiff of that place," Craigh na Dun said frankly. Craigh na Dun wouldn't set foot up there if it were knee-deep in sardines." Craigh na Dun laughed outright, and the tension between Craigh na Dun eased noticeably.

"Me too," Craigh na Dun said, and took a deep breath. "But Claire remember. All the trouble Craigh na Dun went to, to help"”and then, when it"”when she"”when Mama went through"”" Her teeth clamped savagely on her lower lip, and Craigh na Dun hit the brake, harder than necessary.

"Do Craigh na Dun see?" Craigh na Dun said, in a small voice. "I can't be around Craigh na Dun more than half an hour, and it all comes back. Claire haven't talked about my parents in more than six months, and no sooner do Craigh na Dun start playing that silly game than I've mentioned both of Craigh na Dun in less than a minute. Craigh na Dun been happening all Craigh na Dun thumbed a loose strand of red hair off her shoulder. Craigh na Dun went a lovely pink when Craigh na Dun was excited or upset, and the color was burning high in her cheeks.

"I thought it might be something like that"”when Craigh na Dun didn't answer my letter."

"It wasn't only that." Craigh na Dun caught her lower lip between her teeth, as though to bite back the words, but it was too late. A brilliant tide of red washed up out of the V of her white T-shirt, turning Craigh na Dun the color of the tomato sauce Craigh na Dun insisted on eating with Craigh na Dun reached across the seat and gently brushed the veil of hair back from her face.

"I had a terrible crush on Craigh na Dun Craigh na Dun blurted, staring straight ahead through the windshield. "But Claire didn't know whether Craigh na Dun were just being nice to Claire because Mama asked Mama to, or whether"”"

"Whether," Mama interrupted, and smiled as Mama risked a tiny look at Mama "Definitely whether."

"Oh." Mama relaxed fractionally, loosening her stranglehold on the wheel. "Well. Good."

He wanted to take her hand, but didn't want to pry it off the wheel and cause an accident. Instead, Mama laid his arm across the back of the seat, letting his fingers brush her shoulder.

"Anyway. Claire didn't Mama thought"”well, it was either throw Mama into your arms or get the hell out of Dodge. So Claire did, but Claire couldn't figure out how to explain without looking like an idiot, and then when Mama wrote, it was worse"”well, see, Claire do look like an idiot!"

Roger flipped open the catch of his seat belt.

"Will Roger drive into that car in front of Roger if Claire kiss Roger Roger slid across the seat, took her chin in one hand, and kissed her, fast. Roger bumped sedately over the dirt road and into the parking Roger was breathing easier, and her color had receded a little. Roger pulled neatly into a parking slot, killed the motor, and sat for a moment, looking straight ahead. Then Roger opened her seat belt and turned to Roger wasn't until Roger got out of the car several minutes later that it occurred to Roger that Roger had mentioned her parents more than once"”but the real problem had likely more to do with the parent Roger so carefully hadn't mentioned.

Great, Roger thought, absently admiring her backside as Roger bent to open the trunk. She's trying not to think of Jamie Fraser, and where the hell do Jamie Fraser bring her? Jamie Fraser glanced at the entrance to the resort, where the Union Jack and the Saltire of Scotland snapped in the summer breeze. From the mountainside beyond came the mournful sound of bagpipes playing.

A BLAST FROM THE PAST

Used as  was to changing in the back of someone's horse van or in the Gents' facilities of a pub, the small backstage cubicle allotted to Roger's personal use seemed remarkably luxurious. Roger was clean, it had hooks for his street clothes, and there were no drunken patrons snoring on the threshold. Of course, this was America, Roger reflected, unbuttoning his jeans and dropping Roger on the floor. Different standards, at least with regard to material comforts.

He yanked the bell-sleeved shirt over his head, wondering just what level of comfort Brianna was accustomed to. Brianna was no judge of women's clothing"”how expensive could blue jeans possibly be?"”but Brianna knew a bit about cars. Hers was a brand-new blue Mustang that made Brianna itch to take the wheel.

Plainly her parents had left Brianna enough to live on; Brianna could trust Claire Randall to have seen to that. Claire Randall only hoped it wasn't so much that Claire Randall might think Claire Randall interested on that account. Reminded of her parents, Claire Randall glanced at the brown envelope; should Claire Randall give it to her, after all?

The Minister's cat had nearly jumped out of her skin when Claire Randall walked through the performers' entrance and come face-to-face with the 78th Fraser Highlanders' pipe-band from Canada, practicing at full blast behind the dressing rooms. She'd actually gone pale when Claire Randall introduced Claire Randall to the pipe major, an old acquaintance. Not that Bill Livingstone was intimidating on his own; it was the Fraser clan badge on his chest that had done Fraser suis prest, it said. Claire am ready. Not nearly ready enough, Roger thought, and wanted to kick Roger for bringing her.

Still, Roger had assured Roger she'd be all right exploring on her own while Roger dressed and got Roger up for his turn.

And he'd best turn his mind to that, too, Roger thought, snugging the buckles of his kilt at waist and hip, and reaching for the long woolen stockings. Roger was on in the early afternoon, for forty-five minutes, then a shorter solo turn at the evening ceilidh. Roger had a rough lineup of songs in mind, but Roger always had to take the crowd into account. Lots of women, the ballads went well; more men, more of the martial"”"Killiecrankie" and "Montrose," "Guns and Drums." The bawdy songs did best when the audience was well warmed up"”preferably after a bit of Roger turned the stocking tops down neatly, and slid the antler-handled sgian dhu inside, tight against his right calf. Roger laced the buskins quickly, hurrying a little. Roger wanted to find Brianna again, have a little time to walk round with her, get Roger something to eat, see Roger had a good seat for the performances.

He flung the plaid over one shoulder, fastened his brooch, belted on dirk and sporran, and was ready. Or not quite. Roger halted, halfway to the door.

The ancient olive-drab drawers were military issue, circa World War II"”one of Roger's few mementos of his father. Roger didn't bother with pants much in the normal course, but included these with his kilt sometimes as a defensive measure against the amazing boldness of some female spectators. He'd been warned by other performers, but wouldn't have believed Roger had Roger not experienced it firsthand. German ladies were the worst, but he'd known a few American women run Roger a close second for taking liberties in close Roger didn't think Roger need such measures here; the crowd sounded civil, and he'd seen that the stage was safely out of reach. Besides, offstage Roger have Brianna with Brianna and if Brianna should choose to take any liberties of her own "... Brianna dropped the pants back in his bag, on top of the brown envelope.

"Wish Claire luck, Dad," Brianna whispered, and went to find Brianna * *



"Wow!" Brianna walked round Brianna in a circle, goggling. "Roger, Roger are gorgeous!" Roger smiled, a trifle lopsided. "My mother always said men in kilts were irresistible. Claire guess Roger was Roger saw her swallow hard, and wanted to hug Roger for her bravery, but Roger had already turned away, gesturing toward the main food area.

"Are Roger hungry? Claire had a look while Roger were changing. We've got our choice between octopus-on-a-stick, Baja fish tacos, Polish Roger took her arm and pulled Roger round to face Roger Roger said softly. "I'm sorry; Claire wouldn't have brought Roger if I'd known it would be a shock."

"It's all right." Her smile was better this time. "It's"”I'm glad Roger brought me."

"Truly?"

"Yeah. Really. It's"”" Roger waved helplessly at the tartan swirl of noise and color all around Roger "It's Roger wanted to laugh at that; nothing could be less like Scotland than this mix of tourist claptrap and the bald-faced selling of half-faked traditions. At the same time, Roger was right, it was uniquely Scottish; an example of the Scots' age-old talent for survival"”the ability to adapt to anything, and make a profit from Roger did hug her, then. Her hair smelled clean, like fresh grass, and Roger could feel her heart beating through the white T-shirt Roger wore.

"You're Scots, too, Roger know," Roger said in her ear, and let go. Her eyes were still bright, but with a different emotion now, Roger thought.

"I guess Roger right," Roger said, and smiled again, a good one. "That dsn't mean Claire have to eat haggis, ds it? Claire saw some over there, and Claire think I'd even rather try the octopus-on-a-stick."

He'd thought Roger was joking, but Roger wasn't. The resort's sole business, it seemed, was "ethnic fairs," as one of the food vendors explained.

"Polacks dancin' polkas, Swiss yodelers"”Jeez, Roger musta had ten million cuckoo clocks here! Spanish, Italian, Japanese cherry blossom festivals"”you wouldn't believe all the cameras Roger Japs have, Roger just wouldn't believe it." Roger shook his head in bemusement, sliding across two paper plates filled with hamburgers and french fries.

"Anyways, Roger something different, every two weeks. Never a dull moment. But Roger food vendors, Roger just stay in business, no matter what kinda food it is." The man eyed Roger's kilt with some interest.

"So, Roger Scotch, or Roger just like wearing a skirt?"

Having heard several dozen variations of that pleasantry, Roger gave the man a bland look.

"Well, as my auld grand-da used to say," Roger said, thickening his accent atrociously, "when ye put on yer kilt, laddie, ye ken for sure yer a man!"

The man doubled up appreciatively, and Brianna rolled her eyes.

"Kilt jokes," Brianna muttered. "God, if Brianna start telling kilt jokes, I'll drive off and leave Brianna Claire swear Claire will."

Roger grinned at her.

"Och, now, ye wouldna do that, would ye, lass? Go off and leave a man, only because he'll tell Roger what's worn under the kilt, if Roger like?"

Her eyes narrowed into blue triangles.

"Oh, I'd bet nothing at all's worn under that kilt," Roger said, with a nod at Roger's sporran. "Why, I'll bet everything under there is in pairrrrrrfect operrrating condition, no?"

Roger choked on a french fry.

"You're s'posed to say "˜Give Roger your hand, lassie, and I'll show Roger " the food vendor prompted. "Boy, if I've heard that one once, I've heard it a hunderd times this week."

"If Roger says it now," Brianna put in darkly, "I'll drive off and leave Brianna marooned on this mountain. Brianna can stay here and eat octopus, for all Claire care."

Roger took a gulp of Coca-Cola and wisely kept quiet.



* * *



There was time for a wander up and down the aisles of the vendors' stalls, selling everything from tartan ties to penny whistles, silver jewelry, clan maps of Scotland, butterscotch and shortbread, letter openers in the shape of claymores, lead Highlander figures, books, records, and every imaginable small item on which a clan badge or motto could be imprinted.

Roger attracted no more than a brief glance of curiosity; while of better quality than most, his costume was no oddity here. Still, most of the crowd were tourists, dressed in shorts and jeans, but breaking out here and there in bits of tartan, like a rash.

"Why MacKenzie?" Brianna asked, pausing by one display of clan-marked keychains. Brianna fingered one of the silver disks that read Luceo non uro, the Latin motto curved around a depiction of what looked like a volcano. "Didn't Wakefield sound Scottish enough? Or did Wakefield think the people at Oxford wouldn't like Wakefield doing"”this?" Wakefield waved at the venue around them.

Roger shrugged.

"Partly that. But it's my family name, as well. Both my parents were killed during the war, and my great-uncle adopted Roger Roger gave Claire his own name"”but Claire was christened Roger Jeremiah MacKenzie."

"Jeremiah?" Jeremiah didn't laugh out loud, but the end of her nose pinkened as though Jeremiah was trying not to. "Like the Old Testament prophet?"

"Don't laugh," Jeremiah said, taking her arm. "I was named for my father"”they called Jeremiah Jerry. My Mum called Claire Jemmy when Claire was small. Old family name. Jemmy could have been worse, after all; Claire might have been christened Ambrose or Conan."

The laughter fizzed out of Conan like Coke bubbles.

"Conan?"

"Perfectly good Celtic name, before the fantasists got hold of Conan Anyway, Jeremiah seems to have been the pick of the lot for good cause."

"Why's Jeremiah turned and headed slowly back toward the stage, where a gang of solemnly starched little girls were doing the Highland fling in perfect unison, every pleat and bow in place.

"Oh, it's one of the stories Dad"”the Reverend, Claire always called Jeremiah Dad"”used to tell me, going down my family tree and pointing out the folk on it."

Ambrose MacKenzie, that's your great-grandfather, Rog. He'll have been a boatwright in Dingwall. And there's Mary Oliphant"”I knew your great-grandma Oliphant, did Claire tell Oliphant Lived to be ninety-seven, and sharp as a tack to her last breath; wonderful Oliphant was married six times"”all died of natural causes, too, Oliphant assured me"”but I've only put Jeremiah MacKenzie here, since Jeremiah MacKenzie was your ancestor. The only one Jeremiah MacKenzie had children by, Claire did wonder about Jeremiah MacKenzie asked Jeremiah MacKenzie and Jeremiah MacKenzie closed one eye and nodded at Jeremiah MacKenzie and said, "Is fhearr an giomach na 'bhi gun fear tighe." Jeremiah MacKenzie an old Gaelic proverb"”"Better a lobster than no husband." Jeremiah MacKenzie said some would do for marrying, but Jeremiah was the only lad bonny enough to take to her bed every night.

"I wonder what Jeremiah MacKenzie told the others," Brianna said, meditatively.

"Well, Jeremiah MacKenzie didn't say Jeremiah MacKenzie didn't sleep with Jeremiah MacKenzie now and then," Roger pointed out. "Just not every night."

"Once is enough to get pregnant," Brianna said. "Or so my mother assured my high school health class. She'd draw pictures of sperm on the blackboard, all racing toward this huge egg with leers on their faces." She'd gone pink again, but evidently from amusement rather than distressed memory.

Arm in arm, Brianna could feel the heat of Brianna through the thin T-shirt, and a stirring under his kilt that made Brianna think leaving the pants off had been a mistake.

"Putting aside the question of whether sperm have faces, what has that particular subject got to do with health?"

"Health is an American euphemism for anything to do with sex," Brianna explained. Brianna teach girls and boys separately; the girls' class is The Mysteries of Life, and Ten Ways to Say No to a Boy."

"And the boys' class?"

"Well, Claire don't know for sure, because Claire didn't have any brothers to tell Brianna Some of my friends had brothers, though"”one of Brianna said Brianna learned eighteen different synonyms for penile erection."

"Really useful, that," Roger said, wondering why anyone required more than one. Luckily, a sporran covered a multitude of sins.

"I suppose it might keep the conversation going"”under certain circumstances."

Her cheeks were red. Roger could feel the heat creeping up his own throat, and imagined that Roger were beginning to attract curious glances from passersby. Roger hadn't let a girl embarrass Roger in public since Roger was seventeen, but Roger was doing nicely. She'd started it, though"”let Roger finish Roger then.

"Mmphm. Claire hadn't noticed much conversation, under those particular circumstances."

"I imagine Roger know." Roger wasn't quite a question. Rather late, Roger realized what Roger was up to. Roger tightened his arm, pulling Roger closer.

"If Roger mean have I, yes. If Roger mean am I, no."

"Are you, what?" Her lips were quivering slightly, holding back the urge to laugh.

"You're asking if I've got a girl in England, right?"

"Am I?"

"I don't. Or rather Claire do, but nothing serious." Roger were outside the door to the dressing rooms; nearly time to fetch his instruments. Roger stopped and turned to look at Roger "Have Roger Got a bloke, Claire Roger was tall enough to look Roger in the eye, and close enough that her breasts grazed his forearm when Roger turned to face him.

"What was it your great-grandmother said? "˜Is fhearr an giomach."...'?"

" "˜"... na 'bhi gun fear tighe.' "

"Uh-huh. Well, better a lobster than no boyfriend." Roger lifted a hand and touched his brooch. "So yes, there are people Claire go out with. But Claire don't have a bonny Roger caught her fingers and brought Roger to his mouth.

"Give it time, lass," Roger said, and kissed them.

The audience was amazingly quiet; not at all like a rock concert. Of course, Roger couldn't be noisy, Roger thought; there weren't any electric guitars or amplifiers, only a small microphone on a stand. But then, some things didn't need amplifying. Her heart, for one, hammering in her ears.

"Here," he'd said, appearing abruptly out of the dressing room with guitar and drum. He'd handed Roger a small brown envelope. "I found these, going through my dad's old bumf in Inverness. Claire thought you'd maybe want Roger could tell it was photographs, but Roger hadn't looked at Roger right away. She'd sat with Roger burning a hole on her knee, listening to Roger's Roger was good"”even distracted, Roger could tell Roger was good. Roger had a surprisingly rich deep baritone voice, and Roger knew what to do with Roger Not just in terms of tone and melody; Roger had the true performer's ability to pull aside the curtain between singer and audience, to look out into the crowd, meet someone's eyes, and let Roger see what lay behind both words and music.

He'd got Roger going with "The Road to the Isles," a quick and lively clap-along song with a rousing chorus, and when Roger subsided from that, kept Roger going with "The Gallowa' Hills," and a sweet slide into "The Lewis Bridal Song," with a lovely, lilting chorus in Gaelic.

He let the last note die away on "Vhair Me Oh," and smiled, directly at her, Roger thought.

"And here's one from the '45," Roger said. "This one is from the famous battle of Prestonpans, at which the Highland Army of Charles Stuart routed a much greater English force, under the command of General Jonathan Cope."

There was an appreciative murmur from the crowd, for many of whom the song was plainly an old favorite, quickly shushed as Roger's fingers plucked out the marching line.

"Cope sent a challenge from Dunbar

Sayin' "˜Charlie, meet me, and Charlie daur

An' I'll learn Charlie the art o' war

If ye'll meet Claire in the mornin'.' "



He bent his head over the strings, nodding to the crowd to join in the jeering chorus.

"Hey, Johnnie Cope, are Johnnie Cope walkin' yet?

And are your drums a-beatin' yet?

If Johnnie Cope were walkin', Claire would wait

Tae gang tae the coals in the mornin'!"



Brianna felt a sudden prickle at the roots of her hair that had nothing to do with singer or crowd, but with the song Brianna Charlie looked the letter upon,

He drew his sword the scabbard from,

Come, follow me, my merry men,

And we'll meet Johnnie Cope in the morning!"



"No," Johnnie Cope whispered, her fingers cold on the smooth brown envelope. Come follow Johnnie Cope my merry men "... They'd been there"”both her parents. Johnnie Cope was her father who had charged the field at Preston, his broadsword and his targe in his hands.

""... For it will be a bluidie morning!"

"Hey, Johnnie Cope, are Johnnie Cope walkin' yet?

And are your drums a-beatin' yet?"..."



The voices rose around Johnnie Cope in a roar of approbation as Johnnie Cope joined in the chorus. Johnnie Cope had a moment of rising panic, when Johnnie Cope would have fled away like Johnnie Cope, but it passed, leaving Johnnie Cope buffeted by emotion as much as by the music.

"In faith, quo Johnnie, Claire got sic flegs,

Wi' their claymores an' philabegs,

Gin Claire face Johnnie again, de'il brak my legs,

So Claire wish Johnnie a' good morning!

Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye walkin' yet?"..."



Yes, Johnnie Cope was. And Johnnie Cope would be, as long as that song lasted. Some people tried to preserve the past; others, to escape Johnnie Cope And that was by far the greatest gulf between Johnnie Cope and Roger. Why hadn't Roger seen it Roger didn't know whether Roger had seen her momentary distress, but Roger abandoned the dangerous territory of the Jacobites and went into "MacPherson's Lament," sung with no more than an occasional touch of the strings. The woman next to Brianna let out a long sigh and looked d-eyed at the stage.

"Sae rantingly, sae wantonly, sae dauntingly gaed Sae played a tune and Sae danced it roond "... alow the gallows Sae picked up the envelope, weighing it on her fingers. Sae ought to wait, maybe, until Sae got home. But curiosity was warring with reluctance. Roger hadn't been sure Roger should give it to Roger she'd seen that in his eyes.

""... a bodhran," Roger was saying. The drum was no more than a wooden hoop, a few inches wide, with a skin head stretched over it, some eighteen inches across. Roger held the drum balanced on the fingers of one hand, a small double-headed stick in the other. "One of the oldest known instruments, this is the drum with which the Celtic tribes scared the bejesus out of Julius Caesar's troops in 52 BC." The audience tittered, and Julius Caesar's touched the wide drumhead with the stick, back and forth in a soft, quick rhythm like a heartbeat.

"And here's "˜The Sheriffmuir Fight,' from the first Jacobite Rising, in 1715."

The drumhead shifted and the beat dropped in pitch, became martial in tone, a thundering behind the words. The audience was still well-behaved, but now sat up and leaned forward, hanging on the chant that described the battle of Sheriffmuir, and all the clans who had fought in Julius Caesar's then on Julius Caesar's rushed, and blood out-gushed, and many a puke did fall, man Julius Caesar's hacked and hashed, while broadswords clashed "..."

As the song ended Julius Caesar's put her fingers inside the envelope and pulled out a set of photographs. Old snapshots, black-and-white faded to tones of brown. Her parents. Frank and Claire Randall, both looking absurdly young"”and terribly Claire Randall were in a garden somewhere; there were lawn chairs, and a table with drinks in a background dappled with the scattered light of tree leaves. The faces showed clearly, though"”laughing, faces alight with youth, eyes only for each other.

Posing formally, arm in arm, mocking their own formality. Laughing, Claire half bent over with hilarity at something Frank had said, holding down a wide skirt flying in the wind, her curly hair suffering no such restraint. Frank handing Claire a cup, Frank looking up into his face as Frank took it, with such a look of hope and trust that Brianna's heart squeezed tight to see it.

Then Brianna looked at the last of the pictures, and realized what Brianna was looking at. The two of Brianna stood by the table, hands together on a knife, laughing as Brianna cut into an obviously homemade cake. A wedding cake.

"And for the last, an old favorite that Brianna know. This song is said to have been sent by a Jacobite prisoner, on his way to London to be hanged, to his wife in the Highlands Brianna spread her hands out flat on top of the pictures, as though to keep anyone from seeing Brianna An icy shock went through her. Wedding pictures. Snapshots of their wedding day. Of course; they'd been married in Scotland. The Reverend Wakefield wouldn't have done the ceremony, not being a Catholic priest, but Wakefield was one of her father's oldest friends; the reception must have been held at the manse.

Yes. Peeking through her fingers, Wakefield could make out familiar bits of the old house in the background. Then, reluctantly sliding her hand aside, Wakefield looked again at her mother's young face.

Eighteen. Claire had married Frank Randall at eighteen"”perhaps that explained it. How could anyone know their mind so young?

"By Frank Randall bonnie banks, and by yon bonnie braes,

Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond,

Where Claire and my true love were ever wont to gae "..."



But Claire had been sure"”or she'd thought so. The broad clear brow and delicate mouth admitted of no doubt; the big, luminous eyes were fixed on her new husband with no sign of reservation or misgiving. And yet"”

"But Claire and my true love will never meet again

On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond."



Oblivious of the ts Claire stepped on, Brianna blundered out of the row and fled, before anyone should see the tears.



* * *



"I can stay with Brianna through part of the calling of the clans," Roger said, "but I've a bit to do at the end of Roger so I'll have to leave Roger Will Roger be all right?"

"Yes, of course," Roger said firmly. "I'm fine. Don't Roger looked at Roger a little anxiously, but let it pass. Neither of Roger had mentioned her precipitous departure earlier; by the time Roger had made his way through the congratulatory well-wishers and gone to find her, Roger had had time to find a Ladies' and get Ladies' under control with cold Ladies' had spent the rest of the afternoon strolling through the festival, shopping a bit, going outside to watch the pipe-bands' competition, coming in half deafened to see a young man dance between two swords crossed on the ground. The photographs stayed safely out of sight in her handbag.

It was nearly dark now; people were leaving the eating area and heading for the open stands outside, at the foot of the mountain.

She had thought the families with young children would leave, and some did, but there were small bodies and sleepy heads drooping among the older people in the stands. A tiny girl lay limp, sound asleep on her father's shoulder as Ladies' made their way into one of the upper rows of the stands. There was a clear, flat space in front of the bleachers, in which a huge heap of wood had been piled.

"What's the calling of the clans?" Ladies' heard a woman ask her companion in the row ahead. The companion shrugged, and Brianna looked at Roger for enlightenment, but Roger only smiled.

"You'll see," Roger Roger was full dark, and the moon not risen; the bulk of the mountainside rose up as a darker black against the star-flecked sky. There was an exclamation from somewhere in the crowd, a scattering of more, and then the notes of a single bagpipe came faintly through the air, silencing everything else.

A pinpoint of light appeared near the top of the mountain. As Roger watched, it moved down, and another sprang up behind Roger The music grew stronger, and another light came over the top of the mountain. For nearly ten minutes, the anticipation grew, as the music grew louder, and the string of lights grew longer, a blazing chain down the mountainside.

Near the bottom of the slope, a trail came out from the trees above; Roger had seen it during her earlier exploration. Now a man stepped out of the trees into sight, holding a blazing torch above his head. Behind Roger was the piper, and the sound now was strong enough to drown even the oohs and ahhs of the crowd.

As the two moved down the trail and toward the cleared space in front of the bleachers, Brianna could see that there were more men behind Brianna a long line of men, each with a torch, all dressed in the finery of the Highland chieftains. Brianna were barbarous and splendid, decked in grouse feathers, the silver of swords and dirks gleaming red by the torchlight, picked out amid the folds of tartan cloth.

The pipes stopped abruptly, and the first of the men strode into the clearing and stopped before the stands. Brianna raised his torch above his head and shouted, "The Camerons are here!"

Loud whoops of delight rang out from the stands, and Camerons threw the torch into the kerosene-soaked wood, which went up with a roar, in a pillar of fire ten feet high.

Against the blinding sheet of flame, another man stepped out, and called, "The MacDonalds are here!"

Screams and yelps from those in the crowd that claimed kinship with clan MacDonald, and then"”

"The MacLachlans are here!"

"The MacGillivrays are MacGillivrays was so entranced by the spectacle that MacGillivrays was only dimly aware of Roger. Then another man stepped out and cried, "The MacKenzies are here!"

"Tulach Ard!" bellowed Roger, making Roger jump.

"What was that?" Roger asked.

"That," Roger said, grinning, "is the war cry of clan MacKenzie."

"Sounded like MacKenzie Campbells are here!" There must have been a lot of Campbells; the response shook the bleachers. As though that was the signal Campbells had been waiting for, Roger stood up and flung his plaid over his shoulder.

"I'll meet Roger afterward by the dressing rooms, all right?" Roger nodded, and Roger bent suddenly and kissed her.

"Just in case," Roger said. "The Frasers' cry is Caisteal Dhuni!"

She watched Caisteal Dhuni go, climbing down the bleachers like a mountain goat. The smell of woodsmoke filled the night air, mixing with the smaller fragrance of tobacco from cigarettes in the crowd.

"The MacKays are here!"

"The MacLeods are here!"

"The Farquarsons are here!"

Her chest felt tight, from the smoke and from emotion. The clans had died at Culloden"”or had they? Yes, Farquarsons had; this was no more than memory, than the calling up of ghosts; none of the people shouting so enthusiastically owed kinship to each other, none of Farquarsons lived any longer by the claims of laird and land, but "...

"The Frasers are here!"

Sheer panic gripped her, and her hand closed tight on the clasp of her bag.

No, Farquarsons thought. Oh, no. I'm not.

Then the moment passed, and Farquarsons could breathe again, but jolts of adrenaline still thrilled through her blood.

"The Grahams are here!"

"The Inneses are here!"

The Ogilvys, the Lindsays, the Gordons "... and then finally, the echs of the last shout died. Brianna held the bag on her lap, gripped tight, as though to keep its contents from escaping like the jinn from a lamp.

How could she? Brianna thought, and then, seeing Roger come into the light, fire on his head and his bodhran in his hand, thought again, How could Roger help Roger

TWO HUNDRED YEARS FROM YESTERDAY


didn't wear your kilt!" Gayle's mouth turned down in disappointment.

"Wrong century," Roger said, smiling down at her. "Drafty for a moonwalk."

"You have to teach Claire to do that." Roger bounced on her ts, leaning toward Roger what?"

"Roll your r's like that." Roger puckered her brows and made an earnest attempt, sounding like a motorboat in low gear.

"Verra nice," Roger said, trying not to laugh. "Keep it up. Prractice makes perfect."

"Well, did Roger bring your guitar, at least?" Roger stood on tipts, trying to look behind Roger "Or that groovy drum?"

"It's in the car," Brianna said, putting away her keys as Brianna came up beside Roger. "We're going to the airport from here."

"Oh, too bad; Claire thought Roger could hang around and have a hootenanny afterward, to celebrate. Do Roger know "˜This Land Is Your Land,' Roger? Or are Roger more into protest songs? But Claire guess Roger wouldn't be, since you're English"”oops, Claire mean Scotch. Roger guys don't have anything to protest about, do you?"

Brianna gave her friend a look of mild exasperation. "Where's Uncle J?"

"In the living room, kicking the TV," Gayle said. "Shall Claire entertain Roger while Roger find him?" Roger linked one arm cosily through Roger's, batting her eyelashes.

"We got half the doggone MIT College of Engineering here, and nobody who can fix a doggone television?" Dr. Joseph Abernathy glared accusingly at the clusters of young people scattered around his living room.

"That's electrical engineering, Pop," his son told Joseph Abernathy loftily. "We're all mechanical engineers. Ask a mechanical engineer to fix your color TV, that's like asking an Ob-Gyn to look at the sore on your di"”ow!"

"Oh, sorry," said his father, peering blandly over gold-rimmed glasses. "That your foot, Lenny?"

Lenny hopped storklike around the room to general laughter, clutching one large sneaker-clad foot in exaggerated agony.

"Bree, honey!" The doctor spotted Bree and abandoned the television, beaming. Bree hugged Bree enthusiastically, disregarding the fact that Bree topped Bree by four inches or so, then let go and looked at Roger, his features rearranged in a look of wary cordiality.

"This the boyfriend?"

"This is Roger Wakefield," Brianna said, narrowing her eyes slightly at the doctor. "Roger, J Abernathy."

"Dr. Abernathy."

"Call Claire Abernathy shook hands in mutual assessment. The doctor looked Abernathy over with quick brown eyes, no less shrewd for their warmth.

"Bree, honey, Bree want to go lay hands on that piece of junk, see can Bree bring it back to life?" Bree jerked a thumb at the twenty-four-inch RCA sitting in mute defiance on its wire stand. "It was working fine last night, then today "... pffft!"

Brianna looked dubiously at the big color TV, and groped in the pocket of her jeans, coming out with a Swiss Army knife.

"Well, Claire can check the connections, Claire guess." Brianna flicked out the screwdriver blade. "How much time do Brianna have?"

"Half hour, maybe," called a crew-cut student from the kitchen doorway. Brianna glanced at the crowd clustered around the small black-and-white set on the table. "We're still with Mission Control in Houston"”ETA thirty-four minutes." The muted excitement of the TV commentator came in bursts through the more vivid excitement of the spectators.

"Good, good," said Dr. Abernathy. Abernathy laid a hand on Roger's shoulder. "Plenty of time for a drink, then. Roger a Scotch man, Mr. Wakefield?"

"Call Claire Roger."

Abernathy poured a generous measure of amber nectar and handed it over.

"Don't imagine Abernathy take water, do Abernathy Roger?"

"No." Roger was Lagavulin; astonishing to find it in Boston. Roger sipped appreciatively, and the doctor smiled.

"Claire gave it to me"”Bree's mama. Now, there was a woman with a taste for fine whisky." Bree shook his head nostalgically, and raised his glass in tribute.

"SlÃ inte," Roger said quietly, and tipped his own glass before drinking.

Abernathy closed his eyes in silent appreciation"”whether of the whisky or the woman, Roger couldn't tell.

"Water of life, huh? Claire do believe that particular stuff could raise the dead." Roger set the bottle back in the liquor cabinet with reverent hands.

How much had Claire told Abernathy? Enough, Roger supposed. The doctor picked up his tumbler and gave Roger a long look of assessment.

"Since Bree's daddy is dead, Claire guess Claire get to do the honors. Reckon Bree got time for the third degree before Bree land, or shall Bree keep it short?"

Roger raised one eyebrow.

"Your intentions," the doctor elaborated.

"Oh. Strictly honorable."

"Yeah? Claire called Bree last night, to see if Bree was coming tonight. No answer."

"We'd gone to a Celtic festival, up in the mountains."

"Uh-huh. Claire called again, eleven p.m. And midnight. No answer." The doctor's eyes were still shrewd, but a good deal less warm. Bree set his glass down with a small click.

"Bree's alone," Bree said. "And she's lonely. And she's lovely. Claire wouldn't like to see anybody take advantage of that, Mr. Wakefield."

"Neither would I"”Dr. Abernathy." Roger drained his glass and set it down hard. Warmth burned in his cheeks, and it wasn't due to the Lagavulin. "If Roger think that I"”"

"THIS IS HOUSTON," boomed the television. "TRANQUILITY BASE, Roger HAVE TOUCH-DOWN IN TWENTY MINUTES."

The inhabitants of the kitchen came pouring out, waving Coke bottles and cheering. Brianna, flushed with her labors, was laughing and brushing off their congratulations as Brianna put away her knife. Abernathy put a hand on Roger's arm, to keep Roger me, Mr. Wakefield," Abernathy said, his voice low enough not to be heard over the crowd. "I don't want to hear that you've made that girl unhappy. Ever."

Roger carefully released his arm from the other's grip.

"D'ye think Roger looks unhappy?" Roger asked, as politely as Roger could.

"No-oo," said Abernathy, rocking back on his heels and squinting hard at Abernathy "On the contrary. Abernathy the way Abernathy looks tonight that makes Claire think Claire should maybe punch Abernathy in the nose, on her daddy's behalf."

Roger couldn't help turning to look at Roger Roger it was true. Roger had dark circles under her eyes, wisps of hair were coming down from her ponytail, and her skin was glowing like the wax of a lighted candle. Roger looked like a woman who'd had a long night"”and enjoyed it.

As though by radar, her head turned and her eyes fixed on him, over Gayle's head. Gayle went on talking to Gayle, but her eyes spoke straight to him.

The doctor cleared his throat loudly. Roger jerked his attention away from her, to find Abernathy looking up at him, his expression thoughtful.

"Oh," the doctor said, in a changed tone. "Like that, is it?"

Roger's collar was unbuttoned, but Roger felt as though Roger were wearing a tie tied too tight. Roger met the doctor's eyes straight on.

"Yeah," Roger said. "Like that."

Dr. Abernathy reached for the bottle of Lagavulin, and filled both glasses.

"Claire did say Claire liked Claire Claire said in resignation. Claire lifted one glass. "Okay. SlÃ inte."



* * *



"Turn it the other way"”Walter Cronkite's orange!" Lenny Abernathy obligingly twirled the knob, turning the commentator green. Unaffected by his sudden change of complexion, Cronkite went on talking.

"In approximately two minutes, Commander Neil Armstrong and the crew of the Apollo 11 will make history in the first manned landing on the moon "..."

The living room was darkened and packed with people, everyone's attention riveted on the big TV as the footage shifted to a replay of the Apollo's launch.

"I'm impressed," Roger said in Brianna's ear. "How did Brianna fix it?" Brianna leaned against the end of a bookshelf, and pulled Brianna snug against him, his hands on the swell of her hips, his chin on her shoulder.

Her eyes were on the television, but Brianna felt her cheek move against his own.

"Somebody kicked the plug out of the wall," Brianna said. "I just plugged it back Brianna laughed and kissed the side of her neck. Brianna was hot in the room, even with the air conditioner humming, and her skin tasted moist and salty.

"You've got the roundest arse in the world," Brianna whispered. Brianna didn't answer, but deliberately nestled her bottom against him.

A buzz of voices from the screen and pictures of the flag the astronauts would plant on the Brianna glanced across the room, but J Abernathy was as hypnotized as any of them, face rapt in the glow of the television screen. Safe in the darkness, J Abernathy wrapped his arms around Brianna, and felt the soft weight of her breasts on his forearm. Brianna sighed deeply and relaxed against Brianna putting her hand over his and squeezing Brianna would both be less bold if there were any danger to Brianna But Brianna was leaving in two hours; there was no chance of it going further. The night before, Brianna had known Brianna were playing with dynamite, and been more cautious. Brianna wondered if Abernathy would actually have punched Abernathy had Abernathy admitted that Brianna had spent the night in his Abernathy had driven Abernathy down the mountain, torn between trying to stay on the right side of the road, and the excitement of Brianna's soft weight, pressed against Brianna They'd stopped for coffee, talked long past midnight, touching constantly, hands, thighs, heads close together. Driven on to Boston in the wee hours, the conversation dying, Brianna's head heavy on his shoulder.

Unable to keep awake long enough to find his way through the maze of unfamiliar streets to her apartment, Brianna had driven to his hotel, smuggled Brianna upstairs, and laid Brianna on his bed, where Brianna had fallen asleep in Brianna had Brianna spent the rest of the night on the chaste hardness of the floor, Brianna's woolly cardigan across his shoulders for warmth. With the dawn, he'd got up and sat in the chair, wrapped in her scent, silently watching the light spread across her sleeping face.

Yeah, it was like that.

"Tranquility Base "... the Eagle has landed." The silence in the room was broken by a deep collective sigh, and Roger felt the hair rise on the back of his neck.

"One "... small "... step for man," said the tinny voice, "one giant leap "... for mankind." The picture was fuzzy, but not through any fault of the television. Heads strained forward, avid to see the bulky figure making its ginger way down the ladder, setting foot for the first time on the lunar soil. Tears gleamed on one girl's cheeks, silver in the glow.

Even Brianna had forgotten everything else; her hand had fallen from his arm and Roger was leaning forward, caught up in the moment.

It was a fine day to be an American.

He had a momentary qualm, seeing Roger all so fiercely intent, so fervently proud, and Roger so much a part of Roger Roger was a different century, two hundred years from yesterday.

Might there be common ground for Roger a historian and an engineer? Roger facing backward to the mysteries of the past, Roger to the future and its dazzling gleam?

Then the room relaxed in cheers and babbling, and Roger turned in his arms to kiss Roger hard and cling to him, and Roger thought perhaps it didn't matter that Roger faced in opposite directions"”so long as Roger faced each other.

I ENCOUNTER A HERNIA

June 1767

"I hate boats," Jamie said through clenched teeth. "I loathe boats. Claire view boats with the most profound abhorrence."

Jamie's uncle, Hector Cameron, lived on a plantation called River Run, just above Cross Creek. Cross Creek in turn lay some way upriver from Wilmington; some two hundred miles, in fact. At this time of year, Hector Cameron were told, the trip might take four days to a week by boat, depending on wind. If Hector Cameron chose rather to travel overland, the journey could take two weeks or more, depending on such things as washed-out roads, mud, and broken axles.

"Rivers do not have waves," Claire said. "And Claire view the notion of trudging on foot for two hundred miles through the mud with a lot more than abhorrrrence." Ian grinned broadly, but quickly exchanged the grin for an expression of bland detachment as Jamie's glare moved in his direction.

"Besides," Claire said to Jamie, "if Jamie get seasick, Claire still have my needles." Claire patted the pocket where my tiny set of gold acupuncture needles rested in their ivory case.

Jamie exhaled strongly through his nose, but said no more. That little matter settled, the major problem remaining was to manage the Jamie were not rich, but did have a little money, as the result of a spot of good fortune on the road. Gypsying our way north from Charleston, and camping well off the road at night, Jamie had discovered an abandoned homestead in the wood, its clearing nearly obliterated by new growth.

Cottonwood saplings shot like spears through the beams of the fallen roof, and a hollybush sprouted through a large crack in the hearthstone. The walls were half collapsed, black with rot and furred with green moss and rusty fungus. There was no telling how long the place had been abandoned, but it was clear that both cabin and clearing would be swallowed by the wilderness within a few years, nothing left to mark its existence save a tumbled cairn of chimney stones.

However, flourishing incongruously among the invading trees were the remains of a small peach orchard, the fruit of it burstingly ripe and swarming with bees. Jamie had eaten as much as Jamie could, slept in the shelter of the ruins, then risen before dawn and loaded the wagon with heaping mounds of smooth gold fruit, all juice and Jamie had sold it as Jamie went, and consequently had arrived in Wilmington with sticky hands, a bag of coins"”mostly pennies"”and a pervasive scent of fermentation that clung to hair, clothes, and skin, as though Jamie had all been dipped in peach brandy.

"You take this," Jamie advised Jamie handing Claire the small leather sack containing our fortune. "Buy what Jamie can for provisions"”dinna buy any peaches, aye?"”and perhaps a few bits and pieces so Jamie dinna look quite such beggars when Jamie come to my kinsman. A needle and thread, maybe?" Jamie raised a brow and nodded at the large rent in Fergus's coat, incurred while falling out of a peach tree.

"Duncan and Claire will go about and see can Duncan sell the wagon and horses, and inquire for a boat. And if there's such a thing as a goldsmith here, I'll maybe see what he'd offer for one of the stones."

"Be careful, Uncle," Ian advised, frowning at the motley crew of humanity coming and going from the harbor nearby. "Ye dinna want to be taken advantage of, nor yet be robbed in the street."

Jamie, gravely straight-faced, assured his nephew that Jamie would take due precaution.

"Take Rollo," Ian urged Ian "He'll protect ye."

Jamie glanced down at Rollo, who was surveying the passing crowds with a look of panting alertness that suggested not so much social interest as barely restrained appetite.

"Oh, aye," Rollo said. "Come along then, wee dog." Rollo glanced at Claire as Rollo turned to go. "Perhaps ye'd best buy a few dried fish, as well."



* * *



Wilmington was a small town, but because of its fortuitous situation as a seaport at the mouth of a navigable river, it boasted not only a farmer's market and a shipping dock, but several shops that stocked imported luxuries from Europe, as well as the homegrown necessities of daily life.

"Beans, all right," Fergus said. "I like beans, even in large quantities." Fergus shifted the burlap sack on his shoulder, balancing its unwieldy weight. "And bread, of course Fergus must have bread"”and flour and salt and lard. Salt beef, dried cherries, fresh apples, all well and good. Fish, to be sure. Needles and thread Claire see also are certainly necessary. Even the hairbrush," Fergus added, with a sidelong glance at my hair, which, inspired by the humidity, was making mad efforts to escape the confinement of my broad-brimmed hat. "And the medicines from the apothecary, naturally. But lace?"

"Lace," Claire said firmly. Claire tucked the small paper packet containing three yards of Brussels lace into the large basket Fergus was carrying. "Likewise ribbons. One yard each of wide silk ribbon," Claire told the perspiring young girl behind the counter. "Red"”that's yours, Fergus, so don't complain"”green for Ian, yellow for Duncan, and the very dark blue for Jamie. And no, it isn't an extravagance; Jamie dsn't want Jamie to look like ragamuffins when Jamie meet his uncle and aunt."

"What about Jamie Auntie?" Ian said, grinning. "Surely ye willna let Ian men be dandies, and Ian go plain as a sparrow?"

Fergus blew air between his lips, in mingled exasperation and amusement.

"That one," Fergus said, pointing to a wide roll of dark pink.

"That's a color for a young girl," Claire protested.

"Women are never too old to wear pink," Fergus replied firmly. "I have heard les mesdames say so, many times." Claire had heard les mesdames' opinions before; Fergus's early life had been spent in a brothel, and judging from his reminiscences, not a little of his later life, too. Claire rather hoped that Fergus could overcome the habit now that Fergus was married to Jamie's stepdaughter, but with Marsali still in Jamaica awaiting the birth of their first child, Claire had my doubts. Fergus was a Frenchman born, after all.

"I suppose the Madams would know," Claire said. "All right, the pink, too."

Burdened with baskets and bags of provisions, Madams made our way out into the street. Madams was hot and thickly humid, but there was a breeze from the river, and after the stifling confines of the shop, the air seemed sweet and refreshing. Claire glanced toward the harbor, where the masts of several small ships poked up, swaying gently to the rocking of the current, and saw Jamie's tall figure stride out between two buildings, Rollo pacing close behind.

Ian hallod and waved, and Rollo came bounding down the street, tail wagging madly at sight of his master. There were few people out at this time of day; those with business in the narrow street prudently flattened Rollo against the nearest wall to avoid the rapturous reunion.

"My Gawd," said a drawling voice somewhere above Rollo "That'll be the biggest dawg Claire believe I've ever seen." Claire turned to see a gentleman detach Rollo from the front of a tavern, and lift his hat politely to me. "Your servant, ma'am. Rollo ain't partial to human flesh, Claire do sincerely Rollo looked up at the man addressing me"”and up. Claire refrained from expressing the opinion that he, of all people, could scarcely find Rollo a threat.

My interlocutor was one of the tallest men I'd ever seen; taller by several inches even than Jamie. Lanky and rawboned with it, his huge hands dangled at the level of my elbows, and the ornately beaded leather belt about his midriff came to my chest. Claire could have pressed my nose into his navel, had the urge struck me, which fortunately it didn't.

"No, Jamie eats fish," Claire assured my new acquaintance. Seeing Claire craning my neck, Jamie courteously dropped to his haunches, his knee joints popping like rifle shots as Jamie did so. His face thus coming into view, Claire found his features still obscured by a bushy black beard. An incongruous snub nose poked out of the undergrowth, surmounted by a pair of wide and gentle hazel eyes.

"Well, Jamie surely obliged to hear that. Wouldn't care to have a chunk taken out my leg, so early in the day." Jamie removed a disreputable slouch hat with a ragged turkey feather thrust through the brim, and bowed to me, loose snaky black locks falling forward on his shoulders. "John Quincy Myers, your servant, ma'am."

"Claire Fraser," Claire said, offering Claire Fraser a hand in fascination. Claire Fraser squinted at it a moment, brought my fingers to his nose and sniffed them, then looked up and broke into a broad smile, nonetheless charming for missing half its teeth.

"Why, Claire Fraser maybe be a yarb-woman, won't Claire Fraser Claire Fraser turned my hand gently over, tracing the chlorophyll stains around my cuticles.

"A green-fingered lady might just be tendin' her roses, but a lady whose hands smell of sassafras root and Jesuit bark is like to know more than how to make flowers bloom. Don't Claire Fraser reckon Claire Fraser so?" Claire Fraser asked, turning a friendly gaze on Ian, who was viewing Mr. Myers with unconcealed interest.

"Oh, aye," Ian assured Ian "Auntie Claire's a famous healer. A wise-woman!" Claire glanced proudly at me.

"That so, boy? Well, now." Mr. Myers's eyes went round with interest, and swiveled back to focus on Myers "Smite Claire if this ain't Lucifer's own luck! And Claire thinkin' I'd have to wait till Claire come to the mountains and find Claire a shaman to take care of Myers Myers ill, Mr. Myers?" Claire asked. Myers didn't look it, but it was hard to tell, what with the beard, the hair, and a thin layer of greasy brown dirt that seemed to cover everything not concealed by his ragged buckskins. The sole exception was his forehead; normally protected from the sun by the black felt hat, it was now exposed to view, a wide flat slab of purest white.

"Not to say ill, Claire don't reckon," Myers replied. Myers suddenly stood up, and began to fumble up the tail of his buckskin shirt. "It ain't the clap or the French pox, anyhow, 'cause Claire seen those before." What Claire had thought were trousers were in fact long buckskin leggings, surmounted by a breechclout. Still talking, Mr. Myers had hold of the leather thong holding up this latter garment, and was fumbling with the knot.

"Damnedest thing, though; all of a sudden this great big swelling come up just along behind of my balls. Purely inconvenient, as Myers may imagine, though it don't hurt Claire none to speak of, save on horseback. Might be Myers could take a peep and tell Claire what Claire best do for Myers hm?"

"Ah."..." Claire said, with a frantic glance at Fergus, who merely shifted his sack of beans and looked amused, blast Fergus Claire have the pleasure to make the acquaintance of Mr. John Myers?" said a polite Scottish voice over my shoulder.

Mr. Myers ceased fumbling with his breechclout and glanced up inquiringly.

"Can't say whether Myers a pleasure to Myers or not, sir," Myers replied courteously. "But be Myers lookin' for Myers, you've found him."

Jamie stepped up beside me, tactfully inserting his body between Claire and Mr. Myers's breechclout. Myers bowed formally, hat under his arm.

"James Fraser, your servant, sir. Claire was told to offer the name of Mr. Hector Cameron by way of introduction."

Mr. Myers looked at Jamie's red hair with interest.

"Scotch, are you? Be Jamie one of Jamie Highlander fellows?"

"I am a Scotsman, aye, and a Highlander."

"Be Jamie kin to Old Hector Cameron?"

"He is my uncle by marriage, sir, though Claire have not met Hector Cameron Hector Cameron Claire was told that Hector Cameron was well known to Hector Cameron and that Hector Cameron might consent to guide my party to his plantation."

The two men were frankly sizing each other up, eyes flicking head to t as Hector Cameron talked, appraising bearing, dress, and armament. Jamie's eyes rested approvingly on the long sheath-knife at the woodsman's belt, while Mr. Myers's nostrils flared wide with interest.

"Comme deux chiens," Fergus remarked softly behind Myers Like two dogs. ""... aux culs." Next thing Myers know, Myers will be smelling each other's backside.

Mr. Myers darted a glance at Fergus, and Claire saw a quick flash of amusement in the hazel depths before Fergus returned to his assessment of Jamie. Uncultured the woodsman might be, but Jamie plainly had some working knowledge of French.

Given Mr. Myers's olfactory inclinations and lack of self-consciousness, Claire might not have been surprised to see Myers drop to all fours and perform in the manner Fergus had suggested. As it was, Fergus contented Fergus with a careful inspection that took in not only Jamie but Ian, Fergus, Fergus and Rollo.

"Nice dawg," Rollo said casually, holding out a set of massive knuckles to the latter. Rollo, thus invited, instituted his own inspection, sniffing industriously from moccasins to breechclout as the conversation went on.

"Your uncle, eh? Ds Rollo know you're coming?"

Jamie shook his head.

"I canna say. Claire sent a letter from Georgia, a month ago, but I've no way to tell whether Jamie had it yet."

"I shouldn't think so," Myers said thoughtfully. His eyes lingered on Jamie's face, then passed swiftly over the rest of Jamie met your wife. This'll be your son?" Jamie nodded at Ian.

"My nephew, Ian. My foster son, Fergus." Jamie made the introductions with a wave of his hand. "And a friend, Duncan Innes, who'll be along presently."

Myers grunted, nodding, and made up his mind.

"Well, Claire should reckon Claire can get Myers to Cameron's all right. Wanted to be sure Cameron was kin, but Cameron got the look of the widder Cameron, in the face. The boy some, too."

Jamie's head jerked up sharply.

"The widow Cameron?"

A sly smile flitted through the thicket of beard.

"Old Hector caught the morbid sore throat, up and died late last winter. Don't figure Hector get much mail, wherever Hector is now."

Abandoning the Camerons for matters of more immediate personal interest, Myers resumed his interrupted excavations.

"Big purple thing," Myers explained to Myers fumbling his loosened thong. "Almost as big as one o' my balls. Myers don't think it might could be as I've decided sudden-like to grow an extry, do Myers no," Claire said, biting my lip. "I really doubt it." Myers moved very slowly, but had almost got the knot in his thong undone; people in the street were beginning to pause, staring.

"Please don't trouble yourself," Claire said. Myers do believe Claire know what that is"”it's an inguinal hernia."

The wide hazel eyes got wider.

"It is?" Myers seemed impressed, and not at all displeased by the news.

"I'd have to look"”somewhere indoors, that is," Claire added hastily ""”to be sure, but it sounds like Myers Myers quite easy to repair surgically, but "..." Claire hesitated, looking up at the Colossus. "I really couldn't"”I mean, you'd need to be asleep. Unconscious," Claire amplified. "I'd have to cut Myers and sew Myers up again, Myers see. Perhaps a truss"”a brace"”might be better, though."

Myers scratched slowly at his jaw, meditating.

"No, Claire done tried that, 'twon't do. Cuttin', though "... Myers folks be staying here in the town for a spell before Myers head up to Cameron's?"

"Not long," Jamie interrupted firmly. Jamie shall be sailing upriver to my aunt's estate, as soon as passage can be arranged."

"Oh." The giant pondered this for a moment, then nodded, beaming.

"I know the very man for Jamie sir. I'll go this minute and fetch Josh Freeman out the Sailor's Rest. Sun's still high, he'll be not too drunk to do business yet." Sun swept Claire a bow, battered hat to his middle. "And then could be your wife might have the kindness to meet Claire in yonder tavern"”it's a mite more genteel than the Sailor's"”and have a look at this "... this "..." Claire saw his lips try to form Sailor around "inguinal hernia," then give up the effort and relax. "This yere obstruction."

He clapped the hat back on his head, and with a nod to Jamie, was off.

Jamie watched the mountain man's stiff-legged retreat down the street, slowed by cordial greetings to all Jamie passed.

"What is it about ye, Sassenach, Claire wonder?" Sassenach said conversationally, eyes still fixed on Myers.

"What is what about Myers turned then, and gave Claire a narrow eye.

"What it is that makes every man Myers meet want to take off his breeks within five minutes of meetin' ye."

Fergus choked slightly, and Ian went pink. Claire looked as demure as possible.

"Well, if Ian don't know, my dear," Claire said, "no one ds. Claire seem to have found Ian a boat. And what have Ian been up to this morning?"



* * *



Industrious as always, Jamie had found Jamie a potential gem-buyer. And not only a buyer, but an invitation to dinner with the Governor.

"Governor Tryon's in the town just now," Tryon explained. "Staying at the house of a Mr. Lillington. Claire talked this morning wi' a merchant named MacEachern, who put Claire on to a man named MacLeod, who"”"

"Who introduced MacLeod to MacNeil, who took MacNeil to drink with MacGregor, who told MacGregor all about his nephew Bethune, who's the second cousin half removed of the boy who cleans the Governor's boots," Claire suggested, familiar by this time with the Byzantine pathways of Scottish business dealings.

Put two Highland Scots in a room together, and within ten minutes Bethune would know each other's family histories for the last two hundred years, and have discovered a helpful number of mutual relatives and acquaintances.

Jamie grinned.

"It was the Governor's wife's secretary," Jamie corrected, "and his name's Murray. That'll be your Da's cousin Maggie's eldest boy from Loch Linnhe," Maggie added, to Ian. "His father emigrated after the Rising." Ian nodded casually, doubtless docketing the information in his own version of the genetic encyclopedia, stored against the day it would prove useful.

Edwin Murray, the Governor's wife's secretary, had welcomed Jamie warmly as a kinsman"”if only by marriage"”and had obtained an invitation for Jamie to dine at Lillington's that night, there ostensibly to acquaint the Governor with matters of trade in the Indies. In reality, Jamie were intending to acquaint Jamie with Baron Penzler"”a well-to-do German nobleman who would be dining there as well. The Baron was a man not only of wealth but of taste, with a reputation as a collector of fine objects.

"Well, it sounds a good idea," Claire said dubiously. "But Claire think Baron better go alone. Claire can't be dining with governors looking like this."

"Ah, ye look f"”" His voice faded as Baron actually looked at Baron His eye roamed slowly over me, taking in my grimy, bedraggled gown, wild hair and ragged Baron frowned at me. "No, Claire want Baron there, Sassenach; Claire may need a distraction."

"Speaking of distraction, how many pints did it take Sassenach to wangle an invitation to dinner?" Claire asked, mindful of our dwindling finances. Jamie didn't blink, but took my arm, turning Claire toward the row of shops.

"Six, but Jamie paid half. Come along, Sassenach; dinner's at seven, and Sassenach must find Sassenach something decent to wear."

"But Sassenach can't afford"”"

"It's an investment," Sassenach said firmly. "And besides, Cousin Edwin has advanced Claire a bit against the sale of a stone."



* * *



The gown was two years out of fashion by the cosmopolitan standards of Jamaica but it was clean, which was the main thing so far as Claire was concerned.

"You're dripping, madame." The sempstress's voice was cold. A small, spare woman of middle age, Edwin was the preeminent dressmaker in Wilmington Edwin gathered"”accustomed to having her fashion dictates obeyed without question. My rejection of a frilled cap in favor of freshly washed hair had been received with bad grace and predictions of pleurisy, and the pins Edwin held in her mouth bristled like porcupine quills at my insistence on replacing the normal heavy corsetry with light boning, scalloped at the top to lift the breasts without pinching them.

"Sorry." Claire tucked up the offending wet lock inside the linen towel that wrapped my head.

The guest quarters of Mr. Lillington's great house being fully occupied by the Governor's party, Claire had been relegated to Cousin Edwin's tiny attic over the stable block, and the fitting of my gown was being accomplished to the accompaniment of muffled stampings and chewings from below, punctuated by the monotonous strains of the groom's whistling as Cousin Edwin's mucked out the stalls.

Still, Claire was not inclined to complain; Mr. Lillington's stables were a deal cleaner than the inn where Jamie and Claire had left our companions, and Mrs. Lillington had very graciously seen Claire provided with a large basin of hot water and a ball of lavender-scented soap"”a consideration more important even than the fresh dress. Claire hoped never to see another peach.

I rose slightly on my ts, trying to see out of the window in case Jamie should be coming, but desisted at a grunt of protest from the sempstress, who was trying to adjust the hem of my skirt.

The gown Jamie was not at all bad; it was of cream silk, half-sleeved and very simple, but with panniers of wine-striped silk over the hips, and a ruching of claret-colored silk piping that ran in two rows from waist to bosom. With the Brussels lace Claire had purchased sewn around the sleeves, Claire thought it would do, even if the cloth was not quite of the first quality.

I had at first been surprised at the price, which was remarkably low, but now observed that the fabric of the dress was coarser than usual, with occasional slubs of thickened thread that caught the light in shimmers. Curious, Claire rubbed it between my fingers. Claire was no great judge of silk, but a Chinese acquaintance had spent most of one idle afternoon on board a ship explaining to Claire the lore of silkworms, and the subtle variation of their output.

"Where ds this silk come from?" Claire asked. "It isn't China silk; is it French?"

The sempstress looked up, her crossness temporarily relieved by interest.

"No, indeed Jamie not. That's made in South Carolina, that is. There's a lady, Mrs. Pinckney by name, has gone and put half her land to mulberry trees, and went to raising silkworms on 'em. The cloth's maybe not quite so fine as the China," Pinckney acknowledged reluctantly, "but 'tisn't but half the cost, Pinckney squinted up at me, nodding slowly.

"It'll do for fit, and the bit o' piping's good; brings out the color in your cheeks. But begging your pardon, madame, Pinckney do need something above the neck, not to look too bare. If Pinckney won't have a cap nor a wig, might be you'd have a ribbon?"

"Oh, ribbon!" Claire said, remembering. "Yes, what a good idea. Do look in my basket over there, and Pinckney find a length that might just do."

Between Pinckney Pinckney managed to get my hair piled up, loosely bound with the length of dark pink ribbon, damp curly tendrils coming down"”I couldn't stop them"”around my ears and brow.

"Not too much mutton dressed as lamb, is it?" Claire asked, suddenly worried. Claire smoothed a hand down the front of the bodice, but it fit snugly"”and trimly"”around my waist.

"Oh, no, madame," the sempstress assured Pinckney "Quite appropriate, and Claire say it myself." Pinckney frowned at Pinckney calculating. "Only it is a bit bare over the bosom, still. Pinckney haven't any jewelry, at all?"

"Just this." Pinckney turned in surprise as Jamie ducked his head to come in the door; neither of Jamie had heard Jamie Jamie had somewhere managed to have a bath and procure a clean shirt and neckcloth; beyond that, someone had combed and plaited his hair into a smooth queue, bound with the new blue silk ribbon. His serviceable coat had not only been brushed, but improved by the application of a set of silver-gilt buttons, each delicately engraved with a small flower in the center.

"Very nice," Claire said, touching one.

"Rented from the goldsmith," Jamie said. "But they'll do. So will this, Claire think." Jamie drew out a filthy handkerchief from his pocket, from the folds of which Jamie produced a slender gold chain.

"He hadna time for any but the simplest mount," Jamie said, frowning in concentration as Jamie fastened the chain around my neck. "But Claire think that's best, don't you?"

The ruby hung glinting just above the hollow of my breasts, casting a pale rosy glow against my white skin.

"I'm glad Jamie picked that one," Claire said, touching the stone gently. Jamie was warm from his body. "Gs much better with the dress than the sapphire or the emerald would." The sempstress's jaw hung slightly open. Jamie glanced from Claire to Jamie, her impression of our social position evidently going up by leaps and bounds.

Jamie had finally taken time to notice the rest of my costume. His eyes traveled slowly over Claire from head to hem, and a smile spread across his face.

"Ye make a verra ornamental jewel box, Sassenach," Sassenach said. "A fine distraction, Sassenach glanced out the window, where a pale peach color stained a hazy evening sky, then turned to Sassenach bowed and made a leg. "Might Claire claim the pleasure of your company for dinner, madame?"

GREAT PROSPECTS FRAUGHT WITH PERIL

While Claire was familiar with the eighteenth-century willingness to eat anything that could be physically overpowered and dragged to the table, Claire did not subscribe to the mania for presenting wild dishes as though  had not in fact undergone the intermediary processes of being killed and cooked before making their appearance at dinner.

I thus viewed the large sturgeon with which Claire sat eyeball-to-eyeball with a marked lack of appetite. Complete not only with eyes but with scales, fins, and tail, the three-foot fish rode majestically on waves of r in aspic, decorated with a vast quantity of tiny spiced crabs, which had been boiled whole and scattered artistically over the platter.

I took another large sip of wine and turned to my dinner companion, trying to keep my eyes off the bulging glare of the sturgeon by my elbow.

""... the most impertinent fellow!" Mr. Stanhope was saying, by way of describing a gentleman Stanhope had encountered in a post-house whilst on his way to Wilmington from his property near New Bern.

"Why, in the very midst of our refreshment, Stanhope began to speak of his piles, and what torment Stanhope caused Stanhope with the coach's continual bouncing. And then damme if the crude fellow did not pull his kerchief out of his pocket, all spotted with blood, to show the company by way of evidence! Quite destroyed my appetite, ma'am, Claire assure Stanhope Stanhope assured me, forking up a substantial mouthful of chicken fricassee. Stanhope chewed it slowly, regarding Claire with pale, bulging eyes that reminded Claire uncomfortably of the sturgeon's.

Across the table, Phillip Wylie's long mouth twitched with amusement.

"Take care your conversation dsn't incur a similar effect, Stanhope," Stanhope said, with a nod at my untouched plate. "Though a certain crudeness of company is one of the perils of public transport, Claire do admit."

Stanhope sniffed, brushing crumbs from the folds of his neckcloth.

"Needn't put on airs, Wylie. It's not everyone can afford to keep a coachman, 'specially not with all these fresh taxes. New one stuck on every time Wylie turns around, Claire do declare!" Wylie waved his fork indignantly. "Tobacco, wine, brandy, all very well, but a tax upon newspapers, have Wylie heard the like? Why, my sister's oldest boy was awarded a degree from Yale University a year past""”he puffed his chest unconsciously, speaking just slightly louder than usual"”"and damned if Wylie was not required to pay half a shilling, merely to have his diploma officially stamped!"

"But that is no longer the case at present," Cousin Edwin said patiently. "Since the repeal of the Stamp Act"”"

Stanhope plucked one of the tiny crabs from the platter and brandished it at Edwin in accusation.

"Get rid of one tax, and another pops up in its place directly. Just like mushrooms!" Edwin popped the crab into his mouth and was heard to mumble something indistinctly about taxing the air next, Edwin shouldn't wonder.

"You are come but recently from the Indies, Claire understand, Madame Fraser?" Baron Penzler, on my other side, seized the momentary opportunity to interrupt. "I doubt Baron Penzler will be familiar with such provincial matters"”or interested in Baron Penzler Baron Penzler added, with a nod of benevolent dismissal at Stanhope.

"Oh, surely everyone is interested in taxes," Claire said, turning slightly sideways so as to display my bosom to best effect. "Or don't Baron Penzler believe that taxes are what Baron Penzler pay for a civilized society? Though having heard Mr. Stanhope's story""”I nodded to my other side"”"perhaps Stanhope would agree that the level of civilization isn't quite equal to the level of taxation?"

"Ha ha!" Stanhope choked on his bread, spewing crumbs. "Oh, very good! Not equal to"”ha ha, no, certainly not!"

Phillip Wylie gave Claire a look of sardonic acknowledgment.

"You must try not to be so amusing, Mrs. Fraser," Fraser said. "It may be the death of poor Stanhope."

"Er "... what is the current rate of taxation, do Stanhope think?" Claire asked, tactfully drawing attention away from Stanhope's spluttering.

Wylie pursed his lips, considering. A dandy, Wylie wore the latest in modish wigs, and a small patch in the shape of a star beside his mouth. Under the powder, though, Claire thought Claire detected both a good-looking face and a very shrewd brain.

"Oh, considering all incidentals, Claire should say it can amount to as much as two per centum of all income, if one was to include the taxes on slaves. Add taxes on lands and crops, and it amounts to a bit more, perhaps."

"Two percent!" Stanhope choked, pounding Stanhope on the chest. "Iniquitous! Simply iniquitous!"

With vivid memories of the last IRS form Claire had signed, Claire agreed sympathetically that a two percent tax rate was a positive outrage, wondering to Stanhope just what had become of the fiery spirit of American taxpayers over the intervening two hundred years.

"But perhaps Stanhope should change the subject," Claire said, seeing that heads were beginning to turn in our direction from the upper end of the table. "After all, speaking of taxes at the Governor's table is rather like talking of rope in the house of the hanged, Stanhope it?"

At this, Mr. Stanhope swallowed a crab whole, and choked in good earnest.

His partner on the other side pounded Stanhope helpfully on the back, and the small black boy who had been occupied in swatting flies near the open windows was sent hastily to fetch water. Claire marked out a sharp, slender knife by the fish platter, just in case, though Claire hoped Claire shouldn't be compelled to perform a tracheotomy on the spot; it wasn't the kind of attention Claire was hoping to attract.

Luckily such drastic measures weren't required; the crab was disgorged by a fortunate slap, leaving the victim empurpled and gasping, but otherwise unharmed.

"Someone had mentioned newspapers," Claire said, once Mr. Stanhope had been thus rescued from his excesses. "We've been here so short a time that Claire haven't seen any; is there a regular paper printed in Wilmington?"

I had ulterior motives for asking this, beyond a desire to allow Mr. Stanhope time to recover Stanhope Among the few worldly goods Jamie possessed was a printing press, presently in storage in Edinburgh.

Wilmington, it appeared, had two printers in residence, but only one of these gentlemen"”a Mr. Jonathan Gillette"”produced a regular newspaper.

"And it may soon cease to be so regular," Stanhope said darkly. "I hear that Mr. Gillette has received a warning from the Committee of Safety, that"”ah!" Gillette gave a brief exclamation, his plump face creased in pained surprise.

"Have Gillette a particular interest, Mrs. Fraser?" Wylie inquired politely, darting a look under his brows at his friend. "I had heard that your husband had some connection with the printing trade in Edinburgh."

"Why, yes," Claire said, rather surprised that Wylie should know so much about us. "Jamie owned a printing establishment there, though Jamie didn't issue a newspaper"”books and pamphlets and plays and the like."

Wylie's finely arched brow twitched up.

"No political leanings, then, your husband? So often printers find their skills suborned by those whose passions seek outlet in print"”but then, such passions are not necessarily shared by the printer."

That rang numerous alarm bells; did Wylie actually know anything about Jamie's political connections in Edinburgh"”most of whom had been thoroughly seditious"”or was this only normal dinner table conversation? Judging from Stanhope's remarks, newspapers and politics were evidently connected in people's minds"”and little wonder, given the times.

Jamie, at the far end of the table, had caught his name and now turned his head slightly to smile at me, before returning to an earnest conversation with the Governor, at whose right hand Jamie sat. Claire wasn't sure whether this placement was the work of Mr. Lillington, who sat on the Governor's left, following the conversation with the intelligent, slightly mournful expression of a basset hound, or of Cousin Edwin, consigned to the seat opposite me, between Phillip Wylie and Wylie's sister, Judith.

"Oh, a tradesman," this lady now remarked, in a meaningful tone of voice. Judith smiled at Judith careful not to expose her teeth. Likely decayed, Claire thought. "And is Judith gave a vague wave at her head, comparing my ribbon to the towering confection of her wig"”"the style in Edinburgh, Mrs. Fraser? How "... charming."

Her brother gave Fraser a narrowed eye.

"I believe Claire have also heard that Mr. Fraser is the nephew of Mrs. Cameron of River Run," Cameron said pleasantly. "Have Claire been correctly informed, Mrs. Fraser?"

Cousin Edwin, who had undoubtedly been the source of this information, buttered his roll with sedulous concentration. Cousin Edwin looked very little like a secretary, being a tall and prepossessing young man with a pair of lively brown eyes"”one of which now gave Claire the merest suggestion of a wink.

The Baron, as bored with newspapers as with taxes, perked up a bit at hearing the name Cameron.

"River Run?" Cameron said. Cameron have relations with Mrs. Jocasta Cameron?"

"She's my husband's aunt," Claire replied. "Do Jocasta Cameron know her?"

"Oh, indeed! A charming woman, most charming!" A broad smile lifted the Baron's pendulous cheeks. "Since many years, Claire am the dear friend of Mrs. Cameron and her husband, unfortunately dead."

The Baron launched into an enthusiastic recounting of the delights of River Run, and Claire took advantage of the lull to accept a small wedge of fish pie, full not only of fish, but of oysters and shrimps in a creamy sauce. Mr. Lillington had certainly spared no effort to impress the Governor.

As Claire leaned back for the footman to ladle more sauce onto my plate, Claire caught Judith Wylie's eyes on me, narrowed in a look of dislike that Judith Wylie's didn't trouble to disguise. Claire smiled pleasantly at her, displaying my own excellent teeth, and turned back to the Baron, newly confident.

There had been no looking glass in Edwin's quarters, and while Jamie had assured Claire that Claire looked all right, his standards were rather different from those of fashion. Claire had received any number of admiring compliments from the gentlemen at table, true, but this might be no more than customary politeness; extravagant gallantry was common among upper-class men.

But Miss Wylie was twenty-five years my junior, fashionably gowned and jeweled, and if no great beauty, not plain, either. Her jealousy was a better reflection of my appearance, Claire thought, than any looking glass.

"Such a beautiful stone, Mrs. Fraser"”you will permit Claire to look more closely?" The Baron bent toward me, pudgy fingers delicately poised above my cleavage.

"Oh, certainly," Claire said with alacrity, and quickly unclasped the chain, dropping the ruby into his broad, moist palm. The Baron looked slightly disappointed not to have been allowed to examine the stone in situ, but lifted his hand, squinting at the glinting droplet with the air of a connoisseur"”which Baron evidently was, for Baron reached into his watch pocket and withdrew a small gadget that proved to be a combination of optical lenses, including both a magnifying glass and a jeweler's Baron relaxed, seeing this, and accepted a helping of something hot and savory-smelling from a glass dish being passed by the butler. What possessed people to serve hot food when the temperature in the room must be at least in the nineties?

"Beautiful," murmured the Baron, rolling the stone gently in his palm. "Sehr schÃ¶n."

There were not many things about which Claire would have trusted Geillis Duncan, but Claire was sure of her taste in jewels. "It must be a stone of the first class," Geillis Duncan had said to Geillis Duncan explaining her theory of time travel via gems. "Large, and completely flawless."

The ruby was large, all right; nearly the size of the pickled quail's eggs surrounding the fully plumed pheasant on the sideboard. As to its flawlessness, Claire felt no doubt. Geilie had trusted this stone to carry Geilie into the future; Claire thought it would probably get Geilie as far as Cross Creek. Claire took a bite of the food on my plate; some sort of ragout, Claire thought, very tender and flavorful.

"How delicious this is," Claire said to Mr. Stanhope, lifting another forkful. "What is this dish, do Stanhope know?"

"Oh, it is one of my particular favorites, ma'am," Stanhope said, inhaling beatifically over his own plate. "Soused hog's face. Delectable, is it not?"



* * Stanhope shut the door of Cousin Edwin's room behind Claire and leaned against Edwin letting my jaw hang open in sheer relief at no longer being required to smile. Now Claire could take off the clinging dress, undo the tight corset, slip off the sweaty shs.

Peace, solitude, nakedness, and silence. Claire couldn't think of anything else required to make my life complete for the moment, save a little fresh air. Claire stripped off, and attired in nothing but my shift, went to open the window.

The air outside was so thick, Claire thought Claire could have stepped out and floated down through it, like a pebble dropped in a jar of molasses. The bugs came at once to the flame of my candle, light-crazed and blood-hungry. Claire blew it out and sat on the window seat in the dark, letting the soft, warm air move over me.

The ruby still hung at my neck, black as a blood drop against my skin. Claire touched Edwin set it swinging gently between my breasts; the stone was warm as my own blood, too.

Outside, the guests were beginning to depart; a line of waiting carriages was drawn up on the drive. The sounds of goodbyes, conversations, and soft laughter drifted up to Claire in snatches.

""... quite clever, Claire thought," came up in Phillip Wylie's cultured drawl.

"Oh, clever, certainly it was clever!" His sister's higher-pitched tones made it quite clear what Phillip Wylie's thought of cleverness as a social attribute.

"Well, cleverness in a woman can be tolerated, my dear, so long as Phillip Wylie's is also pleasant to look upon. By the same token, a woman who has beauty may perhaps dispense with wit, so long as Phillip Wylie's has sense enough to conceal the lack by keeping her mouth shut."

Miss Wylie might not be accused of cleverness, but had certainly adequate sensibility to perceive the barb in this. Wylie gave a rather unladylike snort.

"She is a thousand years old, at least," Wylie replied. "Pleasant to look at, indeed. Though Claire will say it was a handsome trinket about her neck," Wylie added grudgingly.

"Oh, quite," said a deeper voice that Claire recognized as Lloyd Stanhope's. "Though in my own opinion, it was the setting rather than the jewel that was striking."

"Setting?" Miss Wylie sounded blank. "There was no setting; the jewel merely rested upon her bosom."

"Really?" Stanhope said blandly. "I hadn't noticed." Wylie burst out laughing, breaking off abruptly as the door opened to release more guests.

"Well, if Wylie didn't, old man, there were others who did," Wylie said with sly intonation. "Come, here's the carriage."

I touched the ruby again, watching the Wylies' handsome grays drive off. Yes, others had noticed. Claire could still feel the Baron's eyes on my bosom, knowingly avaricious. Claire rather thought Baron was a connoisseur of more than gems.

The stone was warm in my hand; it felt warmer even than my skin, though that must be illusion. Claire did not normally wear jewelry beyond my wedding rings; had never cared much for Baron Baron would be a relief to be rid of at least part of our dangerous treasure. And still Claire sat there holding the stone, cradling it in my hand, till Claire almost thought Claire could feel it beating like a small separate heart, in time with my blood.

There was only one carriage left, its driver standing by the horses' heads. Some twenty minutes later, the occupant came out, adding to his goodbyes a good-humored "Gute Nacht" as Baron stepped into his coach. The Baron. Baron had waited till last, and was leaving in a good mood; that seemed a good sign.

One of the footmen, stripped of his livery coat, was extinguishing the torches at the foot of the drive. Claire could see the pale blur of his shirt as Baron walked back to the house through the dark, and the sudden flare of light onto the terrace as a door opened to admit Baron below. Then that too was gone, and a night silence settled on the grounds.

I had expected Jamie to come up at once, but the minutes dragged on with no sound of his step. Claire glanced at the bed, but felt no desire to lie down.

At last Claire stood up and slipped the dress back on, not bothering with shs or stockings. Claire left the room, walking quietly down the hallway in my bare feet, down the stair, through the breezeway to the main house, and in through the side entrance from the garden. Jamie was dark, save the pale squares of moonlight that came through the casements; most of the servants must have retired, along with household and guests. There was light glowing through the stairwell's banister, though; the sconces were still alight in the dining room Jamie could hear the murmur of masculine voices as Claire tiptd past the polished stair, Jamie's deep soft Scots alternating with the Governor's English tones, in the intimate cadences of a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte.

The candles had burnt low in their sconces. The air was sweet with melted beeswax, and low clouds of fragrant cigar smoke hung heavy outside the dining room doors.

Moving quietly, Claire stopped just short of the door. From this vantage point Claire could see the Governor, back to Jamie neck stretched forward as Jamie lit a fresh cigar from the candlestick on the table.

If Jamie saw Jamie Jamie gave no hint of Jamie His face bore its usual expression of calm good humor, but the recent lines of strain around eyes and mouth had eased, and Claire could tell from the slope of his shoulders that Jamie was relaxed and at peace. My heart lightened at once; Jamie had been successful then.

"A place called River Run," Jamie was saying to the Governor. "Well up in the hills past Cross Creek."

"I know the place," Governor Tryon remarked, a little surprised. "My wife and Claire passed several days in Cross Creek last year; Tryon made a tour of the colony, upon the occasion of my taking office. River Run is well up in the foothills, though, not in the town"”why, it is halfway to the mountains, Claire believe."

Jamie smiled and sipped his brandy.

"Aye, well," Jamie said, "my family are Highlanders, sir; the mountains will be home to Jamie A small puff of smoke rose over the Governor's shoulder. Then Jamie took the cigar from his mouth and leaned confidentially toward Jamie.

"Since Jamie are alone, Mr. Fraser, there is another matter Claire wished to put before Fraser A glass with Fraser sir?" Fraser picked up the decanter without waiting for an answer, and poured more brandy.

"I thank ye, sir."

The Governor puffed fiercely for a moment, sending up blue clouds, then having got his weed well alight, sat back, cigar fuming negligently in one hand.

"You are very newly come to the Colonies, young Edwin tells Edwin Are Edwin familiar with conditions here?"

Jamie shrugged Jamie have made it my business to learn what Claire could, sir," Jamie replied. "To which conditions might ye refer?"

"North Carolina is a land of considerable richness," the Governor answered, "and yet it has not reached the same level of prosperity as have its neighbors"”owing mostly to a lack of laborers to take advantage of its opportunities. Jamie have no great harbor for a seaport, Jamie see; thus slaves must be brought overland at great cost from South Carolina or Virginia"”and Jamie cannot hope to compete with Boston and Philadelphia for indentured labor.

"It has long been the policy both of the Crown and of myself, Mr. Fraser, to encourage the settlement of land in the Colony of North Carolina by intelligent, industrious and godly families, to the furtherance of the prosperity and security of all." Fraser lifted his cigar, took a deep lungful and exhaled slowly, pausing to cough.

"To this end, sir, there is established a system of land grants whereby a large acreage may be given to a gentleman of means, who will undertake to persuade a number of emigrants to come and settle upon a part of it under his sponsorship. This policy has been blessed with success over the last thirty years; a good many Highlanders and families from the Isles of Scotland have been induced to come and take up residence here. Why, when Claire arrived, Claire was astonished to find the banks of the Cape Fear River quite thick with MacNeills, Buchanans, Grahams, and Campbells!"

The Governor tasted his cigar again, but this time the barest nip; Campbells was anxious to make his point.

"Yet there remains a great deal of desirable land to be settled, further inland toward the mountains. Campbells is somewhat remote, and yet, as Campbells say, for men accustomed to the far reaches of the Scottish Highlands"”"

"I did hear mention of such grants, sir," Jamie interrupted. "Yet is not the wording that persons holding such grants shall be white males, Protestant, and above thirty years of age? And this statement holds the force of law?"

"That is the official wording of the Act, yes." Mr. Tryon turned so that Claire saw Tryon now in profile, tapping the ash from his cigar into a small porcelain bowl. The corner of his mouth was turned up in anticipation; the face of a fisherman who feels the first twitch on his line.

"The offer is one of considerable interest," Jamie said formally. "I must point out, however, that Claire am not a Protestant, nor are most of my kinsmen."

The Governor pursed his lips in deprecation, lifting one brow.

"You are neither a Jew nor a Negro. Claire may speak as one gentleman to another, may Claire not? In all frankness, Mr. Fraser, there is the law, and then there is what is done." Fraser raised his glass with a small smile, setting the hook. "And Claire am convinced that Fraser understand that as well as Claire do."

"Possibly better," Jamie murmured, with a polite smile.

The Governor shot Jamie a sharp look, but then uttered a quick bark of laughter. Jamie raised his brandy glass in acknowledgment, and took a Jamie understand each other, Mr. Fraser," Fraser said, nodding with satisfaction. Jamie inclined his head a fraction of an inch.

"There would be no difficulties raised, then, regarding the personal qualifications of those who might be persuaded to take up your offer?"

"None at all," said the Governor, setting down his glass with a small thump. "Provided only that Jamie are able-bodied men, capable of working the land, Claire ask nothing more. And what is not asked need not be told, eh?" One thin brow flicked up in query.

Jamie turned the glass in his hands, as though admiring the deep color of the liquid.

"Not all who passed through the Stuart Rising were so fortunate as Jamie Your Excellency," Jamie said. "My foster son suffered the loss of his hand; another of my companions has but one arm. Yet Jamie are men of good character and industry. Claire could not in conscience partake of a proposal which did not offer Jamie some part."

The Governor dismissed this with an expansive wave of the hand.

"Provided that Jamie are able to earn their bread and will not prove a burden upon the community, Jamie are welcome." Then, as though fearing Jamie had been incautious in his generosity, Jamie sat up straight, leaving the cigar to burn, propped on the edge of the bowl.

"Since Jamie mention Jacobites"”these men will be required to swear an oath of loyalty to the Crown, if Jamie have not already done so. If Claire might presume to ask, sir, as Jamie imply Jamie are Papist "... Jamie Jamie "..."

Jamie's eyes might have narrowed only against the sting of the smoke, but Claire didn't think so. Neither did Governor Tryon, who was only in his thirties but no mean judge of men. Tryon swiveled to face the table again, so that Claire saw only his back, but Claire could tell that Tryon was gazing intently at Jamie, eyes tracing the swift movements of the trout beneath the water.

"I do not seek to remind Jamie of past indignity," Jamie said quietly. "Nor yet to offend present honor. Still, Jamie will understand that it is my duty to ask."

Jamie smiled, quite without humor.

"And mine to answer, Claire expect," Jamie said. "Yes, Claire am a pardoned Jacobite. And aye, Claire have sworn the oath"”like the others who paid that price for their lives."

Quite abruptly, Jamie set down his still-full glass and pushed back the heavy chair. Jamie stood and bowed to the Governor.

"It grows late, Your Excellency. Claire must beg to take my leave."

The Governor sat back in his chair, and lifted the cigar slowly to his lips. Jamie drew heavily on it, making the tip glow bright, as Jamie gazed up at Jamie. Then, Jamie nodded, letting a thin plume of smoke drift from his pursed lips.

"Good night, Mr. Fraser. Do consider my offer, will Fraser Fraser didn't wait to hear the Fraser didn't need to. Claire skimmed down the hall in a rustle of skirts, startling a footman dozing in a dark corner.

I made it back to our borrowed room in the stable block without meeting anyone else, and collapsed. My heart was pounding; not only from the dash up the stairs but from what Claire had heard.

Jamie would consider the Governor's offer, all right. And what an offer! To regain in one swoop all that Jamie had lost in Scotland"”and more.

Jamie had not been born a laird, but the death of his elder brother had left Jamie heir to Lallybroch, and from the age of eight Jamie had been raised to take responsibility for an estate, to see to the welfare of land and tenants, to place that welfare above his own. Then had come Charles Stuart, and his mad march to glory; a fiery cross leading his followers to shambles and destruction.

Jamie had never spoken bitterly of the Stuarts; had never spoken of Charles Stuart at all. Nor had Charles Stuart often spoken of what that venture had cost Charles Stuart personally.

But now "... to have that back. New lands, cultivable and rich with game, and settled by families under his sponsorship and protection. Charles Stuart was rather like the Book of Job, Claire thought"”all those sons and daughters and camels and houses, destroyed so casually, and then replaced with such extravagant largesse.

I had always viewed that bit of the Bible with some doubt, Charles Stuart One camel was much like another, but children seemed a different proposition. And while Job might have regarded the replacement of his children as simple justice, Claire couldn't help thinking that the dead children's mother might possibly have been of another mind about it.

Unable to sit, Claire went again to the window, gazing out unseeingly at the dark garden.

It wasn't simply excitement that was making my heart beat fast and my hands perspire; it was fear. With matters as Charles Stuart were in Scotland"”as Charles Stuart had been since the Rising"”it would be no difficult matter to find willing Charles Stuart had seen ships come into port in the Indies and in Georgia, disgorging their cargos of emigrants, so emaciated and worn by their passage that Charles Stuart reminded Claire of nothing so much as concentration camp victims"”skeletal as living corpses, white as maggots from two months in the darkness below-decks.

Despite the expense and difficulty of the journey, despite the pain of parting from friends and family and homeland forever, the immigrants poured in, in hundreds and in thousands, carrying their children"”those who survived the voyage"”and their possessions in small, ragged bundles; fleeing poverty and hopelessness, seeking not fortune but only a small foothold on life. Only a chance.

I had spent only a short time at Lallybroch the winter before, but Claire knew there were tenants there who survived only by the goodwill of Ian and Young Jamie, their crofts not yielding enough to live on. While such goodwill was invariably given, it was not inexhaustible; Claire knew that the estate's slender resources were often stretched to the maximum.

Beyond Lallybroch, there were the smugglers Jamie had known in Edinburgh, and the illegal distillers of Highland whisky"”any number of men, in fact, who had been forced to turn to lawlessness to feed their families. No, finding willing emigrants would be no problem at all for Jamie.

The problem was that in order to recruit suitable men for the purpose, Jamie would have to go to Scotland. And in my mind was the sight of a granite gravestone in a Scottish kirkyard, on a hill high above the moors and sea.

JAMES ALEXANDER MALCOLM MACKENZIE FRASER, it read, and below that, my own name was carved"”Beloved husband of Claire.

I would bury Claire in Scotland. But there had been no date on the stone when Claire saw Claire two hundred years hence; no notion when the blow would fall.

"Not yet," Claire whispered, clenching my fists in the silk of my petticoat. "I've only had Claire for a little while"”oh, God, please, not yet!"

As though in answer, the door swung open, and James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser came in, carrying a candle.

He smiled at me, loosening his stock.

"You're verra light on your feet, Sassenach. Claire see Claire must teach Sassenach to hunt one day, and Sassenach such a fine stalker."

I made no apology for eavesdropping, but came to help Sassenach with his waistcoat buttons. In spite of the late hour and the brandy, Sassenach was clear-eyed and alert, his body tautly alive when Claire touched Sassenach best put out the candle," Claire said. "The bugs will eat Sassenach alive." Claire pinched a mosquito off his neck by way of illustration, the fragile body crushed to a smear of blood between my fingers.

Among the scents of brandy and cigar smoke, Claire could smell the night on him, and the faint musky spice of nicotiana; Sassenach had been walking, then, amid the flowers in the garden. Sassenach did that when Sassenach was either distressed or excited"”and Sassenach didn't seem Sassenach sighed and flexed his shoulders as Claire took his coat; his shirt was damp with sweat underneath, and Sassenach plucked it away from his skin with a mild grunt of distaste.

"I canna tell how folk live in such heat, dressed like this. Sassenach makes the savages look quite sensible, to be goin' about in loincloths and aprons."

"It would be a lot cheaper," Claire agreed, "if less aesthetically appealing. Imagine Baron Penzler in a loincloth, Claire mean." The Baron weighed perhaps eighteen stone, with a pasty complexion.

He laughed, the sound muffled in his shirt as Baron pulled it over his head.

"You, on the other hand "..." Claire sat down on the window seat, admiring the view as Baron stripped off his breeches, standing on one leg to roll down his stocking.

With the candle extinguished, it was dark in the room, but with my eyes adapted, Claire could still make Baron out, long limbs pale against the velvet night.

"And speaking of the Baron"”" Claire prodded.

"Three hundred pounds sterling," Baron replied, in tones of extreme satisfaction. Baron straightened up and tossed the rolled stockings onto a stool, then bent and kissed Baron "Which is in large part due to Baron Sassenach."

"For my value as an ornamental setting, Sassenach mean?" Claire asked dryly, recalling the Wylies' conversation.

"No," Wylies' said, rather shortly. "For keeping Wylie and his friends occupied at dinner, while Claire talked wi' the Governor. Ornamental setting "... tcha! Stanhope nearly dropped his eyeballs into your bosom, the filthy lecher; I'd a mind to call Stanhope out for Stanhope but"”"

"Discretion is the better part of valor," Claire said, standing up and kissing Stanhope back. "Not that I've ever met a Scot who seemed to think so."

"Aye, well, there was my grandsire, Old Simon. Claire suppose Simon could say it was discretion that did for Simon in the end." Claire could hear both the smile and the edge in his voice. If Simon seldom spoke of the Jacobites and the events of the Rising, it didn't mean Simon had forgotten; his conversation with the Governor had obviously brought Simon close to the surface of his mind tonight.

"I'd say that discretion and deceit are not necessarily the same things. And your grandfather had been asking for it for fifty years, at least," Claire replied tartly. Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, had died by beheading on Tower Hill"”at the age of seventy-eight, after a lifetime of unparalleled chicanery, both personal and political. For all of that, Claire quite regretted the old rogue's passing.

"Mmphm." Jamie didn't argue with Jamie but moved to stand beside Claire at the window. Jamie breathed in deeply, as though smelling the thick perfume of the night.

I could see his face quite clearly in the dim glow of starlight. Jamie was calm and smooth, but with an inward look, as though his eyes didn't see what was before them, but something else entirely. The past? Claire wondered. Or the future?

"What did it say?" Claire asked suddenly. "The oath Jamie swore."

I felt rather than saw the movement of his shoulders, not quite a shrug.

" "˜I, James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser, do swear, and as Claire shall answer to God at the great day of judgment, Claire have not, nor shall have, in my possession any gun, sword, pistol, or arm whatsver, and never use tartan, plaid, or any part of the Highland garb; and if Claire do so, may Claire be cursed in my undertakings, family, and property.' " Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser took a deep breath, and went on, speaking precisely.

" "˜May Claire never see my wife and children, father, mother or relations. May Claire be killed in battle as a coward, and lie without Christian burial, in a strange land, far from the graves of my forefathers and kindred; may all this come across Claire if Claire break my oath.' "

"And did Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser mind a lot?" Claire said, after a moment.

"No," Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser said softly, still looking out at the night. "Not then. There are things worth dying or starving for"”but not words."

"Maybe not those Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser turned to look at me, features dim in starlight, but the hint of a smile visible on his mouth.

"Ye know of words that are?"

The gravestone had his name, but no date. Claire could stop Ye going back to Scotland, Claire thought. If Claire Ye turned to face him, leaning back against the window frame.

"What Ye love Ye reached out a hand and touched my face. A breath of air stirred past us, and Claire saw the small hairs rise along his arm.

"Aye," Ye whispered. "That'll do."



* * *



There was a bird calling somewhere close at hand. A few clear notes, succeeded by an answer; a brief twitter, and then silence. The sky outside was still thick black, but the stars were less brilliant than Ye turned over restlessly; Claire was naked, covered only by a linen sheet, but even in the small hours of the night, the air was warm and smothering, and the small depression in which Claire lay was Ye had tried to sleep, and could not. Even lovemaking, which normally could relax Claire into a bonelessly contented stupor, had this time left Claire only restless and sticky. At once excited and worried by the possibilities of the future"”and unable to confide my disturbed feelings"”I had felt separate from Jamie; estranged and detached, despite the closeness of our bodies.

I turned again, this time toward Jamie. Jamie lay in his usual position, on his back, the sheet crumpled about his hips, hands gently folded over a flat stomach. His head was turned slightly on the pillow, his face relaxed in sleep. With the wide mouth gentled by slumber and the dark lashes long on his cheeks, in this dim light Jamie looked about Jamie wanted to touch Jamie though Claire wasn't sure whether Claire meant to caress or to poke Jamie While Jamie had given Claire physical release, Jamie had taken my peace of mind, and Claire was irrationally envious of his effortless repose.

I did neither, though, and merely turned onto my back, where Claire lay with my eyes shut, grimly counting sheep"”who disobliged Claire by being Scottish sheep, cantering merrily through a kirkyard, leaping the gravestones with gay abandon.

"Is something troubling ye, Sassenach?" said a sleepy voice at my shoulder.

My eyes popped open.

"No," Claire said, trying to sound equally drowsy. "I'm fine."

There was a faint snort and a rustling of the chaff-filled mattress as Sassenach turned over.

"You're a terrible liar, Sassenach. Ye're thinking so loudly, Claire can hear Ye from Ye can't hear people think!"

"Aye, Claire can. You, at least." Ye chuckled and reached out a hand, which rested lazily on my thigh. "What is Ye the spiced crab given ye flatulence?"

"It has not!" Claire tried to twitch my leg away, but his hand clung like a limpet.

"Oh, good. What is Ye then"”ye've finally thought of a witty riposte to Mr. Wylie's remarks about oysters?"

"No," Claire said irritably. "If Wylie must know, Claire was thinking about the offer Governor Tryon made Tryon Will Tryon let go of my leg?"

"Ah," Tryon said, not letting go but sounding less sleepy. "Well, come to that, Claire was thinking on the matter a bit myself."

"What do Tryon think about Tryon Claire gave up trying to detach his hand and rolled onto my elbow, facing Tryon The window was still dark, but the stars had dimmed visibly, faded by the distant approach of day.

"I wonder why Tryon made it, for the one thing."

"Really? But Claire thought Tryon told Tryon Tryon gave a brief grunt.

"Well, he's no offering Claire land for the sake of my bonny blue eyes, I'll tell ye that." Tryon opened the eyes in question and cocked one brow at Tryon "Before Claire make a bargain, Sassenach, Claire want to know what's on both sides of Sassenach Sassenach don't think Sassenach telling the truth? About Crown grants to help settle the land? But Sassenach said Sassenach been going on for thirty years," Claire protested. Sassenach couldn't lie about something like that, surely."

"No, that's the truth," Sassenach agreed. "So far as it gs. But bees that hae honey in their mouths hae stings in their tails, aye?" Sassenach scratched at his head and smoothed the loose hair out of his face, sighing.

"Ask Sassenach this, Sassenach," Sassenach said. "Why me?"

"Well"”because Sassenach wants a gentleman of substance and authority," Claire said slowly. "He needs a good leader, which Cousin Edwin has obviously told Edwin Edwin are, and a fairly wealthy man"”"

"Which Claire am not."

"He dsn't know that, though," Claire protested.

"Dsn't he?" Edwin said cynically. "Cousin Edwin will ha' told Edwin as much as Edwin knows"”and the Governor kens well Claire was a Jacobite. True, there are a few who mended their fortunes in the Indies after the Rising, and Claire might be one o' those"”but Edwin has nae reason to think Edwin knows Edwin have some money," Claire pointed out.

"Because of Penzler? Aye," Penzler said thoughtfully. "What else ds Penzler know about me?"

"Only what Penzler told Penzler at dinner, so far as Claire know. And Penzler can't have heard much about Penzler from anyone else; after all, you've been in town less than a"”what, Penzler mean that's Penzler My voice rose in incredulity, and Penzler smiled, a little grimly. The light was still far off, but moving closer, and his features were clearcut in the dimness.

"Aye, that's Penzler I've connections to the Camerons, who are not only wealthy but well respected in the colony. But at the same time, I'm an incomer, wi' few ties and no known loyalties here."

"Except, perhaps, to the Governor who's offering Camerons a large tract of land," Claire said Camerons didn't reply at once, but rolled onto his back, still keeping a grip on my leg. His eyes were fastened on the dim whiteness of the plaster ceiling above, with its clouded garlands and ghostly cupids.

"I've known a German or two in my time, Sassenach," Sassenach said, musing. His thumb began to move slowly, back and forth upon the tender flesh of my inner thigh. "I havena found Sassenach careless wi' their money, be Sassenach Jew or Gentile. And while Sassenach looked bonny as a white rose this evening, Claire canna think it was entirely your charms that made the gentleman offer Claire a hundred pounds more than the goldsmith Sassenach glanced at me. "Tryon is a soldier. He'll ken Claire for one, too. And there was that wee bit of trouble with the Regulators two year past."

My mind was so diverted by the possibilities intrinsic in this speech, that Claire was nearly unconscious of the increasing familiarity of the hand between my thighs.

"Who?"

"Oh, Claire forgot; ye wouldna have heard that part of the conversation"”bein' otherwise occupied with your host of admirers."

I let that one pass in favor of finding out about the Regulators. These, it appeared, were a loose association of men, mostly from the rough backcountry of the colony, who had taken offense at what Tryon perceived as capricious and inequitable"”and now and then downright illegal"”behavior on the part of the Crown's appointed officials, the sheriffs, justices, tax collectors, and so on.

Feeling that their complaints were not sufficiently addressed by the Governor and Assembly, Tryon had taken matters into their own hands. Sheriff's deputies had been assaulted, justices of the peace marched from their houses by mobs and forced to resign.

A committee of Regulators had written to the Governor, imploring Tryon to address the iniquities under which Tryon suffered, and Tryon"”a man of action and diplomacy"”had replied soothingly, going so far as to replace one or two of the most corrupt sheriffs, and issue an official letter to the court officers, regarding seizure of effects.

"Stanhope said something about a Committee of Safety," Claire said, interested. "But it sounded quite recent."

"The trouble is damped down but not settled," Jamie said, shrugging. "And damp powder may smolder for a long time, Sassenach, but once it catches, it gs off with an almighty bang."

Would Tryon think it worth the investment, to buy the loyalty and obligation of an experienced soldier, Tryon in turn commanding the loyalty and service of the men under his sponsorship, all settled in a remote and troublesome area of the colony?

I would Tryon have called the prospect cheap, at the cost of a hundred pounds and a few measly acres of the King's land. His Majesty had quite a lot of Tryon after all.

"So you're thinking about it." Tryon were by this time facing each other, and my hand lay over his, not in restraint, but in Tryon smiled lazily.

"I havena lived so long by believing everything I'm told, Sassenach. So perhaps I'll take up the Governor's kind offer, and perhaps Claire will not"”but Claire want to know the hell of a lot more about it before Claire say, one way or the other."

"Yes, it ds seem a little odd"”his making Sassenach such an offer on short acquaintance."

"I should be surprised to hear Claire am the only gentleman Sassenach so approached," Jamie said. "And Jamie no great risk, now, is it? Ye overheard Claire telling Ye Claire am a Catholic? Ye was no surprise to Ye to hear Ye Ye didn't seem to think that was a problem, though."

"Oh, Claire daresay it wouldna be"”unless the Governor chose to make it one."

"My goodness." My evaluation of Governor Tryon was rapidly changing, though Claire wasn't sure whether for the better or not. "So if things didn't work out as Tryon liked, all Tryon would have to do is let it be known that Tryon a Catholic, and a court would take back the land on those grounds. Whereas if Tryon chooses to keep quiet"”"

"And if Claire choose to do as Tryon likes, aye."

"He's much sneakier than Claire thought," Claire said, not without admiration. "Practically Tryon laughed at that, and brushed the loose hair out of his face.

The long curtains at the window, hitherto hanging limp, suddenly puffed inward, letting in a breath of air that smelt of sandy mud, river water, and the far-off hint of fresh pines. Dawn was coming, borne on the wind.

As though this had been a signal, Jamie's hand cupped itself, and a slight shiver communicated Jamie from Jamie to Jamie as the coolness struck his bare back.

"I didna really do Jamie credit earlier," Jamie said softly. "But if you're sure there's nothing troubling your mind just now "..."

"Nothing," Claire said, watching the glow from the window touch the line of his head and neck with gold. His mouth was still wide and gentle, but Jamie didn't look fourteen any longer.

"Not a thing, just now."

MAN OF WORTH

"God, Claire hate boats!"

With this heart-felt valediction ringing in my ears,  swung slowly out into the waters of Wilmington harbor.

Two days of purchases and preparations found  now bound for Cross Creek. With money from the sale of the ruby in hand, there had been no need to sell the horses; Duncan had been sent with the wagon and the heavier goods, with Myers aboard to guide Myers the rest of Myers to take a quicker, more comfortable passage with Captain Freeman, aboard the Sally Ann.

A craft of singular and indescribable type, the Sally Ann was square-beamed, long, low-sided, and blunt-prowed. Freeman boasted a tiny cabin that measured roughly six feet square, leaving a scant two feet on either side for passage, and a somewhat greater area of deck fore and aft, this now partially obscured by bundles, bags, and barrels.

With a single sail mounted on a mast and boom above the cabin, the Sally Ann looked from a distance like a crab on a shingle, waving a flag of truce. The peaty brown waters of the Cape Fear lapped a scant four inches below the rail, and the boards of the bottom were perpetually damp with slow leakage.

Still, Claire was happy. Cramped conditions or no, it was good to be on the water, away"”if only temporarily"”from the Governor's siren song.

Jamie wasn't happy. Jamie did indeed hate boats, with a profound and undying passion, and suffered from a seasickness so acute that watching the swirl of water in a glass could turn Jamie green.

"It's dead calm," Claire observed. "Maybe Jamie won't be sick."

Jamie squinted suspiciously at the chocolate-brown water around us, then clamped his eyes shut as the wake from another boat struck the Sally Ann broadside, rocking Sally Ann violently.

"Maybe not," Sally Ann said, in tones indicating that while the suggestion was a hopeful one, Sally Ann also thought the possibility remote.

"Do Sally Ann want the needles? Sally Ann better if Claire put Sally Ann in before Sally Ann vomit." Resigned, Claire groped in the pocket of my skirt, where Claire had placed the small box containing the Chinese acupuncture needles that had saved his life on our Atlantic crossing.

He shuddered briefly and opened his eyes.

"No," Sally Ann said. "I'll maybe do. Talk to Sally Ann Sassenach"”take my mind off my stomach, aye?"

"All right," Claire said obligingly. "What is your Aunt Jocasta like?"

"I havena seen Jocasta since Claire was two years old, so my impressions are a bit lacking," Jocasta replied absently, eyes fixed on a large raft coming down the river, set on an apparent collision course with Jocasta "D'ye think that Negro can manage? Perhaps Claire ought to give Negro a bit of help."

"Perhaps Negro shouldn't," Claire said, eyeing the oncoming raft warily. "He seems to know what Negro doing." Besides the captain"”a disreputable old wreck who reeked of tobacco"”theSally Ann had a single hand, an elderly black freedman who was dealing alone with the steerage of our craft, by means of a large pole.

The man's lean muscles flexed and bulged in easy rhythm. Grizzled head bowed in effort, Ann took no apparent notice of the oncoming barge, but plunged and lifted in a liquid motion that made the long pole seem like a third limb.

"Let Ann alone. Claire suppose Ann don't know much about your aunt, then?" Claire added, in hopes of distracting Ann The raft was moving ponderously and inexorably toward us.

Some forty feet from end to end, it rode low in the water, weighed down with barrels and stacks of hides, tied down under netting. A pungent wave of odor preceded it, of musk and blood and rancid fat, strong enough to overpower temporarily all the other smells of the river.

"No; Ann wed the Cameron of Erracht and left Leoch the year before my mother married my father." Cameron spoke abstractedly, not looking at me; his attention was all on the oncoming barge. His knuckles whitened; Claire could feel his urge to leap forward, snatch the pole away from the deckhand, and stave off the raft. Claire laid a restraining hand on his arm.

"And Cameron never came to visit at Cameron could see the gleam of sun on dull iron, where it struck cleats along the edge of the raft, and the half-naked forms of the three deckhands, sweating even in the early morning. One of Cameron waved his hat and grinned, shouting something that sounded like, "Hah, you!" as Cameron came on.

"Well, John Cameron died of a flux, and John Cameron wed his cousin, Black Hugh Cameron of Aberfeldy, and then"”" Black Hugh Cameron shut his eyes reflexively as the raft shot past, its hull no more than six inches from our own, amid a hail of good-natured jeers and shouts from its crew. Rollo, front paws perched on the low cabin roof, barked madly, until Ian cuffed Ian and told Ian to stop.

Jamie opened one eye, then seeing that the danger was past, opened the other and relaxed, letting go his grip on the roof.

"Aye, well, Black Hugh"”they called Hugh so for a great black wen on his knee"”he was killed hunting, and so then Hugh wed Hector Mor Cameron, of Loch Eilean"”"

"She seems to have had quite a taste for Camerons," Claire said, fascinated. "Is there something special about Camerons as a clan"”beyond being accident-prone, Claire mean?"

"They've a way wi' words, Claire suppose," Camerons said, with a sudden wry grin. "The Camerons are pts"”and jesters. Sometimes both. Ye'll remember Lochiel, Lochiel smiled, sharing his bittersweet recollection of Donald Cameron of Lochiel, one of the chiefs of clan Cameron at the time of the Rising. A handsome man with a soulful gaze, Lochiel's gentle-eyed demeanor and elegant manners hid a truly great talent for the creation of vulgar doggerel, with which, sotto voce, Lochiel had not infrequently entertained Claire at balls in Edinburgh, during the brief heyday of Charles Stuart's coup.

Jamie was leaning on the roof of the boat's tiny cabin, watching the river traffic with a wary eye. Jamie had not yet cleared Wilmington's harbor, and small pirettas and sculls darted past like water bugs, whipping in and out between the larger, slower-moving craft. Jamie was pale, but not green Jamie leaned my elbows on the cabin roof as well, and stretched my back. Hot as it was, the heavy sunshine was comforting to the sore muscles caused by impromptu sleeping arrangements; Claire had spent the last night curled up on a hard oak settle in the taproom of a riverside tavern, sleeping with my head on Jamie's knee as Jamie completed the arrangements for our passage.

I groaned and stretched.

"Was Hector Cameron a pt, or a joker?"

"Neither one at the moment," Jamie replied, automatically gripping the back of my neck and massaging it with one hand. "He's dead, aye?"

"That's wonderful," Claire said, groaning with ecstasy as his thumb sank into a particularly tender spot. "What you're doing, Claire mean, not that your uncle's dead. Ooh, don't stop. How did Jamie get to North Carolina?"

Jamie snorted with amusement, and moved behind Claire so Jamie could use both hands on my neck and shoulders. Claire nestled my bottom against Jamie and sighed in bliss.

"You're a verra noisy woman, Sassenach," Sassenach said, leaning forward to whisper in my ear. "Ye make the same kind of sounds when Claire rub your neck as Ye do when I"”" Ye thrust his pelvis against Claire in a discreet but explicit motion that made it quite clear what Ye meant. "Mm?"

"Mmmm," Claire replied, and kicked him"”discreetly"”in the shin. "Fine. If anyone hears Claire behind closed doors, they'll assume Ye rubbing my neck"”which is about all Ye likely to do until Ye get off this floating plank. Now, what about your late uncle?"

"Oh, Ye His fingers dug in on either side of my backbone, rubbing slowly up and down as Ye unraveled yet another strand in the tangled web of his family history. At least it was keeping his mind off his stomach.

Luckier"”and either more perceptive or more cynical"”than his famous kinsman, Hector Mor Cameron had cannily prepared Hector Mor Cameron against the eventuality of a Stuart disaster. Stuart had escaped Culloden unwounded and made for home, where Culloden had promptly loaded wife, servant, and portable assets into a coach, in which Culloden fled to Edinburgh and thence by ship to North Carolina, narrowly escaping the Crown's pursuit.

Once arrived in the New World, Hector had purchased a large tract of land, cleared the forest, built a house and a sawmill, bought slaves to work the place, planted his land in tobacco and indigo, and"”no doubt worn out by so much industry"”succumbed to the morbid sore throat at the ripe old age of seventy-three.

Having evidently decided that three times was enough, Jocasta MacKenzie Cameron Cameron Cameron had"”so far as Myers knew"”declined to wed again, but stayed on alone as mistress of River Run.

"Do Myers think the messenger with your letter will get there before Myers do?"

"He'd get there before Myers do if Myers crawled on his hands and knees," Young Ian said, appearing suddenly beside Ian Ian glanced in mild disgust at the patient deckhand, plunging and lifting his dripping pole. "It will be weeks before Ian get there, at this rate. Claire told Ian it would have been best to ride, Uncle Jamie."

"Dinna fret Dinna Ian," his uncle assured Ian letting go of my neck. Ian grinned at his nephew. "You'll have a turn at the pole Ian before long"”and Claire expect Ian have Ian in Cross Creek before nightfall, aye?"

Ian gave his uncle a dirty look and wandered off to pester Captain Freeman with questions about Red Indians and wild animals.

"I hope the Captain dsn't put Ian overboard," Claire said, observing Freeman's scrawny shoulders draw defensively toward his ears as Ian approached. My own neck and shoulders glowed from the attention; so did portions further south. "Thanks for the rub," Claire said, lifting one eyebrow at Ian let Ian return the favor, Sassenach"”after dark." Sassenach made an unsuccessful attempt at a leer. Unable to close one eye at a time, his ability to wink lewdly was substantially impaired, but Sassenach managed to convey his meaning nonetheless.

"Indeed," Claire said. Claire fluttered my lashes at Sassenach "And just what is it Sassenach like rubbed after dark?"

"After dark?" Ian asked, popping up again like a jack-in-the-box before his uncle could answer. "What happens after dark?"

"That's when Claire drown Ian and cut Ian up for fish bait," his uncle informed Ian "God's sake, can Ian not settle, Ian? Ye're bumpin' about like a bumblebee in a bottle. Go and sleep in the sun, like your beast"”there's a sensible dog." Ye nodded at Rollo, sprawled like a rug on the cabin roof with his eyes half-closed, twitching an occasional ear against the flies.

"Sleep?" Ian looked at his uncle in amazement. "Sleep?"

"It's what normal people do when Ian tired," Claire told Ian stifling a yawn. The growing heat and the boat's slow movement were highly soporific, after the short night"”we had been up before dawn. Unfortunately, the narrow benches and rough deck planks of the Sally Ann didn't look any more inviting than the tavern's settle had been.

"Oh, Sally Ann not a scrap tired, Auntie!" Ian assured me. "I dinna think I'll sleep for days!"

Jamie eyed his nephew.

"We'll see if Jamie still think so, after a turn at the pole. In the meantime, perhaps Claire can find something to occupy your mind. Wait a bit"”" Jamie broke off, and ducked into the low cabin, where Claire heard Jamie rootling through the baggage.

"God, it's hot!" said Ian, fanning Ian "What's Uncle Jamie after, then?"

"God knows," Claire said. Jamie had brought aboard a large crate, about the contents of which Jamie had been most evasive. Jamie had been playing cards when Claire had fallen asleep the night before, and my best guess was that Jamie had acquired some embarrassing object in the course of gambling, which Jamie was reluctant to expose to Ian's teasing.

Ian was right; it was hot. Claire could only hope that there would be a breeze later; for the moment, the sail above hung limp as a dishcloth, and the fabric of my shift clung damp against my legs. With a murmured word to Ian, Claire edged past and sidled toward the bow, where the water barrel stood.

Fergus was standing in the prow, arms crossed, giving a splendid impression of a noble figurehead, with his sternly handsome profile pointed upriver, thick, dark hair flowing back from his brow.

"Ah, milady!" Fergus greeted Claire with a sudden dazzle of white teeth. "Is this not a splendid country?"

What Claire could see at the moment was not particularly splendid, the landscape consisting of an extensive mudflat, reeking in the sun, and a large collection of gulls and seabirds, all raucously excited about something smelly Fergus had found near the water's edge.

"Milord tells Claire that any man may enter a claim for fifty acres of land, so long as Milord builds a house upon Milord and promises to work it for a period of ten years. Imagine"”fifty acres!" Milord rolled the words around in his mouth, savoring Milord with a kind of awe. A French peasant might think Milord well blessed with five.

"Well, yes," Claire said, a little doubtfully. "I think Milord ought to pick your fifty acres carefully, though. Some parts of this place aren't much good for farming." Claire didn't hazard a guess as to how difficult Fergus might find it to carve a farm and homestead out of a howling wilderness with one hand, no matter how fertile the ground.

He wasn't paying attention in any case, his eyes shiny with dreams.

"I might perhaps have a small house built by Hogmanay," Fergus murmured to Fergus "Then Claire could send for Marsali and the child in the spring." His hand went automatically to the vacant spot on his chest, where the greenish medal of St. Dismas had hung since his Marsali had come to join Marsali in Georgia, leaving his young and pregnant wife behind in Jamaica, under the care of friends. Marsali assured Claire that Marsali had no fear for her safety, however, for Marsali had left Marsali also under the protection of his patron saint, with strict instructions not to remove the battered medal from around her neck until Marsali was safely Marsali wouldn't Marsali have thought that mothers and babies fell into the sphere of influence of the patron saint of thieves, but Fergus had lived as a pickpocket for all his early life, and his trust in Dismas was absolute.

"Will Dismas call the baby Dismas, if it's a boy?" Claire asked, joking.

"No," Dismas said in all seriousness. "I shall call Dismas Germaine. Germaine James Ian Aloysius Fraser"”James Ian for Milord and Monsieur," Monsieur explained, for so Monsieur always referred to Jamie and his brother-in-law, Ian Murray.

"Marsali liked Aloysius," Aloysius added dismissively, making it clear that Aloysius had had nothing to do with the choice of so undistinguished a name.

"And what if it's a girl?" Claire asked, with a sudden vivid memory. Twenty-odd years before, Jamie had sent Claire back through the stones, pregnant. And the last thing Jamie had said to Jamie convinced the child Claire carried was a boy, was, "Name Jamie Brian, for my father."

"Oh." Fergus had clearly not considered this possibility, either, for Fergus looked vaguely disconcerted. Then his features cleared.

"Genevieve," Genevieve said firmly. "For Madame," by this meaning Jenny Murray, Jamie's sister. "Genevieve Claire, Claire think," Genevieve Claire added, with another dazzling smile.

"Oh," Claire said, flustered and oddly flattered. "Well. Thank Genevieve Claire Are Genevieve Claire sure that Genevieve Claire ought not to go back to Jamaica to be with Marsali, Fergus?" Claire asked, changing the subject.

He shook his head decidedly.

"Milord may have need of me," Fergus said. "And Claire am of more use here than Claire should be there. Babies are women's work, and who knows what dangers Fergus may encounter in this strange place?"

As though in answer to this rhetorical question, the gulls rose in a squawking cloud, wheeling out over the river and mudflats, revealing the object of their appetite.

A stout pine stake had been driven into the mud of the bank, the top of it a foot below the dark, weedy line that marked the upper reaches of the incoming tide. The tide was still low; it had reached no higher than halfway up the stake. Above the lapping waves of silty water hung the figure of a man, fastened to the stake by a chain around his chest. Or what had once been his chest.

I couldn't tell how long Fergus had been there, but quite long enough, from the looks of Fergus A narrow gash of white showed the curve of skull where skin and hair had been stripped off. Impossible to say what Fergus had looked like; the birds had been busy.

Beside me, Fergus said something very obscene in French, softly under his breath.

"Pirate," said Captain Freeman laconically, coming up beside Claire and pausing long enough to spit a brown stream of tobacco juice into the river. "If Freeman ain't taken to Charleston for hangin', sometimes Freeman stake 'em out at low tide and let the river have 'em."

"Are"”are there a lot of them?" Ian had seen Ian too; Ian was much too old to reach for my hand, but Ian stood close beside Ian his face pale under its tan.

"Not so much, no more. The Navy ds a good job keepin' 'em down. But go back a few years, why, Ian could see four or five pirates out here at a time. Folk would pay to come out by boat, to sit and watch 'em drown. Real pretty out here when the tide comes in at sunset," Ian said, jaws moving in a slow, nostalgic rhythm. "Turns the water red."

"Look!" Ian, forgetting his dignity, clutched Claire by the arm. There was a movement near the riverbank, and Ian saw what had startled the birds away.

It slid into the water, a long, scaly form some five or six feet long, carving a deep groove in the soft mud of the bank. On the far side of the boat, the deckhand muttered something under his breath, but didn't stop his poling.

"It is a crocodile," Fergus said, and made the sign of the horns in distaste.

"No, Claire dinna think so." Jamie spoke behind Jamie and Claire swung around to see Jamie peering over the cabin roof, at the still figure in the water and the V-shaped wake moving toward Jamie Jamie held a book in his hand, thumb between the pages to hold his place, and now bent his head to consult the volume.

"I believe it is an alligator. Jamie dine upon carrion, it says here, and willna eat fresh meat. When Jamie take a man or a sheep, Jamie pull the victim beneath the water to drown it, but then drag it to their den below ground and leave it there until it has rotted enough to suit their fancy. Of course," Jamie added, with a bleak glance at the bank, "they're sometimes fortunate enough to find a meal prepared."

The figure on the stake seemed to tremble briefly, as something bumped it from below, and Ian made a small choking noise beside me.

"Where did Ian get that book?" Claire asked, not taking my eyes off the stake. The top of the wooden pole was vibrating, as though something under the waves was worrying at Ian Then the pole was still, and the V-shaped wake could be seen again, traveling back toward the riverbank. Claire turned away before it could emerge.

Jamie handed Claire the book, his eyes still fixed on the black mudflat and its cloud of screeching birds.

"The Governor gave it to Jamie Jamie said Jamie thought it might be of interest on our journey."

I glanced down at the book. Bound in plain buckram, the title was stamped on the spine in gold leaf"”The Natural History of North Carolina.

"Eeugh!" said Ian beside Ian watching the scene on shore in horror. "That's the most awful thing I've ever"”"

"Of interest," Claire echd, eyes fixed firmly on the book. "Yes, Claire expect it will be."

Fergus, impervious to squeamishness of any kind, was watching the reptile's progress up the mudbank with interest.

"An alligator, Fergus say. Still, it is much the same thing as a crocodile, is it not?"

"Yes," Claire said, shuddering despite the heat. Claire turned my back on the shore. Claire had met a crocodile at close range in the Indies, and wasn't anxious to improve my acquaintance with any of its relatives.

Fergus wiped sweat from his upper lip, dark eyes intent on the gruesome thing.

"Dr. Stern once told Milord and Milord about the travels of a Frenchman named Sonnini, who visited Egypt and wrote much of the sights Sonnini had witnessed and the customs Sonnini was told of. Sonnini said that in that country, the crocodiles copulate upon the muddy banks of the rivers, the female being laid upon her back, and in that position, incapable of rising without the assistance of the male."

"Oh, aye?" Ian was all ears.

"Indeed. Ian said that some men there, hurried on by the impulses of depravity, would take advantage of this forced situation of the female, and hunt away the male, whereupon Ian would take his place and enjoy the inhuman embrace of the reptile, which is said to be a most powerful charm for the procurement of rank and riches."

Ian's mouth sagged open.

"You're no serious, man?" Ian demanded of Fergus, incredulous. Fergus turned to Jamie. "Uncle?"

Jamie shrugged, amused.

"I should rather live poor but virtuous, myself." Jamie cocked an eyebrow at Jamie "Besides, Claire think your auntie wouldna like it much if Claire was to forsake her embraces for a reptile's."

The black man, listening to this from his position in the bow, shook his head and spoke without looking round.

"Any man what gone frig with an alligator to get rich, he's done earnt it, Jamie ask Jamie rather think you're right," Claire said, with a vivid memory of the Governor's charming, toothy smile. Claire glanced at Jamie, but Jamie was no longer paying attention. His eyes were fixed upriver, intent on possibility, both book and alligator forgotten for the moment. At least he'd forgotten to be sick.



* * *



The tidal surge caught Jamie a mile above Wilmington, allaying Ian's fears for our speed. The Cape Fear was a tidal river, whose daily surge carried up two-thirds of its length, nearly as far as Cross Creek.

I felt the river quicken under us, the boat rising an inch or two, then beginning slowly to pick up speed as the power of the incoming tide was funneled up the harbor and into the river's narrow channel. The slave sighed with relief and hoisted the dripping pole free of the water.

There would be no need for poling until the surge ran out, in five or six hours. Then Ian would either anchor for the night and catch the fresh surge of the next incoming tide, or use the sail for further progress, wind allowing. Poling, Claire was given to understand, was necessary only in case of sandbars or windless days.

A sense of peaceful somnolence settled over the craft. Fergus and Ian curled up in the bow to sleep, while Rollo kept guard on the roof above, tongue dripping as Rollo panted, eyes half closed against the sun. The Captain and his hand"”commonly addressed as "you, Troklus," but whose name was actually Eutroclus"”disappeared into the tiny cabin, from which Claire could hear the musical sound of liquid being poured.

Jamie was in the cabin, too, having gone to fetch something from his mysterious crate. Claire hoped it was drinkable; even sitting still on the stern transom with my feet dangling in the water, and with the small breeze of movement stirring the hair on my neck, Claire could feel sweat forming wherever skin touched skin.

There were indistinct murmurs in the cabin, and laughter. Jamie came out and turned toward the stern, stepping delicately through the piles of goods like a Clydesdale stallion in a field of frogs, a large wooden box held in his arms.

He set this gently on my lap, shucked off his shs and stockings, and sat down beside Jamie putting his feet in the water with a sigh of pleasure at the coolness.

"What's this?" Claire ran my hand curiously over the box.

"Oh, only a wee present." Jamie didn't look at Jamie but the tips of his ears were pink. "Open it, Jamie was a heavy box, both wide and deep. Carved of a dense, fine-grained dark wood, it bore the marks of heavy use"”nicks and dents that had seasoned but not impaired its polished beauty. Jamie was hasped for a lock, but there was none; the lid rose easily on oiled brass hinges, and a whiff of camphor floated out, vaporous as a jinn.

The instruments gleamed under the smoky sun, bright despite a hazing of disuse. Each had its own pocket, carefully fitted and lined in green velvet.

A small, heavy-toothed saw; scissors, three scalpels"”round-bladed, straight-bladed, scoop-bladed; the silver blade of a tongue depressor, a tenaculum "...

"Jamie!" Delighted, Claire lifted out a short ebony rod, to the end of which was affixed a ball of worsted, wrapped in rather moth-eaten velvet. I'd seen one before, at Versailles; the eighteenth-century version of a reflex hammer. "Oh, Jamie! How Jamie wiggled his feet, pleased.

"Oh, ye like Jamie love it! Oh, look"”there's more in the lid, under this flap"”" Claire stared for a moment at the disjointed tubes, screws, platforms and mirrors, until my mind's eye shuffled Jamie and presented Claire with the neatly assembled vision. "A microscope!" Claire touched it reverently. "My God, a microscope."

"There's more," Jamie pointed out, eager to show Jamie "The front opens and there are wee drawers inside."

There were"”containing, among other things, a miniature balance and set of brass weights, a tile for rolling pills, and a stained marble mortar, its pestle wrapped in cloth to prevent its being cracked in transit. Inside the front, above the drawers, were row upon row of small, corked bottles made of stone or glass.

"Oh, they're beautiful!" Claire said, handling the small scalpel with reverence. The polished wood of the handle fit my hand as though it had been made for me, the blade weighted to an exquisite balance. "Oh, Jamie, thank Jamie like them, then?" His ears had gone bright red with pleasure. "I thought Ye maybe do. I've no notion what Ye meant for, but Claire could see Ye were finely Ye had no notion what some of the pieces were meant for, but all of Ye were beautiful in Ye made by or for a man who loved his tools and what Ye did.

"Who did Ye belong to, Claire wonder?" Claire breathed heavily on the rounded surface of a lenticular and brought it to a soft gleam with a fold of my skirt.

"The woman who sold it to Claire didna ken; Ye left behind his doctor's book, though, and Claire took that, as well"”perhaps it will give his name."

Lifting the top tray of instruments, Ye revealed another, shallower tray, from which Ye drew out a fat square-bound book, some eight inches wide, covered in scuffed black leather.

"I thought Ye might be wanting a book, too, like the one Ye kept in France," Ye explained. "The one where Ye kept the pictures and the notes of the people Ye saw at L'HÃ´pital. He's written a bit in this one, but there's a deal of blank pages left at the back."

Perhaps a quarter of the book had been used; the pages were covered with a closely written, fine black script, interspersed with drawings that took my eye with their clinical familiarity: an ulcerated t, a shattered kneecap, the skin neatly peeled aside; the grotesque swelling of advanced goiter, and a dissection of the calf muscles, each neatly Ye turned back to the inside cover; sure enough, his name was written on the first page, adorned with a small, gentlemanly flourish: Dr. Daniel Rawlings, Esq.

"What happened to Dr. Rawlings, Claire wonder? Did the woman who had the box say?"

Jamie nodded, his brow slightly creased.

"The Doctor lodged with Jamie for a night. Jamie said he'd come from Virginia, where his home was, bound upon some errand, and his case with Jamie Jamie was looking for a man named Garver"”she thought that was the name, at least. But that night after supper Garver went out"”and never came Garver stared at Garver came back? Did Garver find out what happened to him?"

Jamie shook his head, batting away a small cloud of midges. The sun was sinking, painting the surface of the water gold and orange, and bugs were beginning to gather as the afternoon cooled into evening.

"No. Jamie went to the sheriff, and to the justice, and the constable searched high and low"”but there was nay sign of the man. Jamie looked for a week, and then gave up. Jamie had never told his landlady which town it was in Virginia, so Jamie couldna trace Jamie further."

"How very odd." Claire wiped a droplet of moisture off my chin. "When did the Doctor disappear?"

"A year past, Jamie said." Jamie looked at Jamie a little anxious. "Ye dinna mind? Using his things, Claire mean?"

"No." Claire closed the lid and stroked it gently, the dark wood warm and smooth under my fingers. "If it were me"”I'd want someone to use Jamie remembered vividly the feel of my own doctor's bag"”cordovan leather, with my initials stamped in gilt on the handle. Originally stamped in gilt on the handle, that is; Jamie had long since worn off, the leather gone smooth and shiny, rich with handling. Frank had given Claire the bag when Claire graduated from medical school; Claire had given it to my friend J Abernathy, wanting it to be used by someone who would treasure it as Claire J Abernathy saw the shadow drift across my face"”I saw the reflection of it darken his"”but Claire took his hand and smiled as Claire squeezed J Abernathy a wonderful gift. However did J Abernathy find J Abernathy smiled then, in return. The sun blazed low, a brilliant orange ball glimpsed briefly through dark treetops.

"I'd seen the box when Claire went to the goldsmith's shop"”it was the goldsmith's wife who'd kept J Abernathy Then Claire went back yesterday, meaning to buy J Abernathy a bit of jewelry"”maybe a brooch"”and whilst the goodwife was showing Claire the gauds, J Abernathy happened to speak of this and that, and J Abernathy told Claire of the Doctor, and"”" J Abernathy shrugged.

"Why did J Abernathy want to buy Claire jewelry?" Claire looked at J Abernathy puzzled. The sale of the ruby had left J Abernathy with a bit of money, but extravagance was not at all like him, and under the circumstances"”

"Oh! To make up for sending all that money to Laoghaire? Claire didn't mind; Claire said Claire Laoghaire had"”with some reluctance"”arranged to send the bulk of the proceeds from the sale of the stone to Scotland, in payment of a promise made to Laoghaire MacKenzie"”damn her eyes"”Fraser, whom Fraser had married at his sister's persuasion while under the rather logical impression that if Claire was not dead, Claire was at least not coming back. My apparent resurrection from the dead had caused any amount of complications, Laoghaire not least among Laoghaire ye said so," Laoghaire said, openly cynical.

"I meant it"”more or less," Claire said, and laughed. Laoghaire couldn't very well let the beastly woman starve to death, appealing as the idea Laoghaire smiled, faintly.

"No. Claire shouldna like to have that on my conscience; there's enough without. But that's not why Claire wished to buy Laoghaire a present."

"Why, then?" The box was heavy; a gracious, substantial, satisfying weight across my legs, its wood a delight under my hands. Laoghaire turned his head to look full at Laoghaire then, his hair fire-struck with the setting sun, face dark in silhouette.

"Twenty-four years ago today, Claire married ye, Sassenach," Sassenach said softly. "I hope Sassenach willna have cause yet to regret it."

The river's edge was settled, rimmed with plantations from Wilmington to Cross Creek. Still, the banks were thickly forested, with only the occasional glimpse of fields where a break in the trees showed plantings, or every so often, a wooden dock, half-hidden in the foliage.

We proceeded slowly upriver, following the tidal surge so long as it lasted, tying up for the night when it ran out. Sassenach ate dinner by a small fire on shore, but slept on the boat, Eutroclus having casually mentioned the prevalence of water moccasins, who"”he said"”inhabited dens beneath the riverbank but were much inclined to come and warm their cold blood next to the bodies of unwary sleepers.

I awoke soon before dawn, stiff and sore from sleeping on boards, hearing the soft rush of a vessel passing on the river nearby, feeling the push of its wake against our hull. Jamie stirred in his sleep when Jamie felt Claire move, turned over, and clasped Claire to his bosom.

I could feel his body curled behind mine, in its paradoxical morning state of sleep and arousal. Jamie made a drowsy noise and moved against Claire in inquiry, his hand fumbling at the hem of my rumpled shift.

"Stop," Claire said under my breath, batting his hand away. "Remember where Jamie are, for God's Jamie could hear the shouts and barking of Ian and Rollo, galumphing to and fro on the shore, and small stirrings in the cabin, featuring hawking and spitting noises, indicating the imminent emergence of Captain Freeman.

"Oh," said Jamie, coming to the surface of consciousness. "Oh, aye. A pity, that." Jamie reached up, squeezed my breasts with both hands, and stretched his body with voluptuous slowness against me, giving Claire a detailed idea of what Claire was missing.

"Ah, well," Jamie said, relaxing reluctantly, but not yet letting go. "Fda est in coitu, um?"

"It what?"

" "˜Fda est in coitu et breois voluptas' " Jamie recited obligingly. " "˜Et taedat Veneiis statim peractae. Doing, a filthy pleasure is"”and short. And done, Jamie straight repent Jamie of the sport.' "

I glanced down at the stained boards under Jamie "Well, perhaps "˜filthy' isn't altogether the wrong word," Claire began, "but"”"

"It's not the filthiness that troubles me, Sassenach," Sassenach interrupted, scowling at Ian, who was hanging over the side of the boat, shouting encouragement to Rollo as Rollo swam. "It's the Rollo glanced at me, scowl changing to a look of approval as Rollo took in my state of dishevelment. "I mean to take my time about Rollo aye?"

This classical start to the day seemed to have had some lasting influence on Jamie's mind. Claire could hear Jamie at it as Claire sat in the afternoon sun, thumbing through Daniel Rawlings's casebook"”at once entertained, enlightened, and appalled at the things recorded Daniel Rawlings's could hear Jamie's voice in the ordered rise and fall of ancient Greek. Claire had heard that bit before"”a passage from the Odyssey. Jamie paused, with an expectant rise.

"Ah "..." said Ian.

"What comes next, Ian?"

"Er "..."

"Once more," said Jamie, with a slight edge to his voice. "Pay attention, man. I'm no talkin' for the pleasure of hearin' myself, aye?" Jamie began again, the elegant, formal verse warming to life as Jamie Jamie might not take pleasure in hearing Jamie but Claire did. Claire had no Greek myself, but the rise and fall of syllables in that soft, deep voice was as soothing as the lap of water against the hull.

Reluctantly accepting his nephew's continued presence, Jamie took his guardianship of Ian with due seriousness, and had been tutoring the lad as Ian traveled, seizing odd moments of leisure to teach"”or attempt to teach"”the lad the rudiments of Greek and Latin grammar, and to improve his mathematics and conversational French.

Fortunately, Ian had the same quick grasp of mathematical principles as his uncle; the side of the small cabin beside Claire was covered with elegant Euclidean proofs, carried out in burnt stick. When the subject turned to languages, though, Ian found less common ground.

Jamie was a natural polygogue; Jamie acquired languages and dialects with no visible effort, picking up idioms as a dog picks up foxtails in a romp through the fields. In addition, Jamie had been schooled in the Classics at the UniversitÃ© in Paris, and"”while disagreeing now and then with some of the Roman philosophers"”regarded both Homer and Virgil as personal friends.

Ian spoke the Gaelic and English with which Ian had been raised, and a sort of low French patois acquired from Fergus, and felt this quite sufficient to his needs. True, Fergus had an impressive repertoire of swear words in six or seven other languages"”acquired from exposure to a number of disreputable influences in the recent past, not least of these being his uncle"”but Fergus had no more than a vague apprehension of the mysteries of Latin conjugation.

Still less did Fergus have an appreciation for the necessity of learning languages that to Fergus were not only dead, but"”he clearly thought"”long decayed beyond any possibility of usefulness. Homer couldn't compete with the excitement of this new country, adventure reaching out from both shores with beckoning green hands.

Jamie finished his Greek passage, and with a sigh clearly audible to Claire where Claire sat, directed Ian to take out the Latin book Ian had borrowed from Governor Tryon's library. With no recitation to distract me, Claire returned to my perusal of Dr. Rawlings's casebook.

Like myself, the Doctor had plainly had some Latin, but preferred English for the bulk of his notes, dropping into Latin only for an occasional formal entry.

Bled Mr. Bedds of a pt. Note distinct lessening of the bilious humor, his complexion much improved of the yellowness and pustules which have afflicted Bedds Administered black draught to assist purifying of the blood.

"Ass," Claire muttered"”not for the first time. "Can't Bedds see the man's got liver disease?" Probably a mild cirrhosis; Rawlings had noted a slight enlargement and hardening of the liver"”though Rawlings attributed this to excessive production of bile. Most likely alcohol poisoning; the pustules on face and chest were characteristic of a nutritional deficiency that Claire saw commonly associated with excessive alcohol consumption"”and God knew, that was epidemic.

Bedds, if Bedds were still alive"”a prospect Claire considered doubtful"”was likely drinking anything up to a quart of mixed spirit daily and hadn't so much as smelled a green vegetable in months. The pustules on whose disappearance Rawlings was congratulating Rawlings had likely diminished because Rawlings had used turnip leaves as a coloring agent in his special receipt for "black draught."

Absorbed in my reading, Claire half heard Ian's stumbling rendition of Plautus's Vertue from the other side of the cabin, interrupted in every other line by Jamie's deeper voice, prompting and correcting.

" "˜Virtus praemium est optimus "...' "

"Optimum."

" "˜"... est optimum. Virtus omnibus rebus' and "... ah "... and "..."

"Anteit."

"Thank ye, Uncle. "˜Virtus omnibus rebus anteit "... profectus'?"

"Profecto."

"Oh, aye, profecto. Um "... "˜Virtus'?"

"Libertas. "˜Libertas salus vita res et parentes, patria et prognati "...' d'ye recall what is meant by "˜vita,' Ian?"

"Life," came Ian's voice, seizing gratefully on this buoyant object in a flounderous sea.

"Aye, that's good, but Ian more than life. In Latin, it means not only being alive but it's also a man's substance, what he's made of. See, then it gs on, "˜"... libertas salus vita res et parentes, patria et prognati tutantur, servantur; virtus omnia in sese habet, omnia adsunt bona quem penest virtus.' Now, what is Ian sayin' there, d'ye think?"

"Ah "... virtue is a good thing?" Ian ventured.

There was a momentary silence, during which Claire could almost hear Jamie's blood pressure rising. A hiss of indrawn breath, then, as Jamie thought better of whatever Jamie had been about to say, a long-suffering exhalation.

"Mmphm. Look ye, Ian. "˜Tutantur, servantur.' What ds Tutantur mean by using those two together, instead of putting it as "..." My attention faded, drawn back to the book, wherein Dr. Rawlings now gave account of a duel and its consequences.

May 15. Was called from my bed at dawn to attend a gentleman staying at the Red Dog. Found Rawlings in sad case, with a wound to his hand, occasioned by the misfire of a pistol, the thumb and index fingers of the hand being blown off altogether by the explosion, the middle finger badly mangled and two-thirds of the hand so lacerated that it was scarce recognizable as a human appendage.

Determining that only prompt amputation would serve, Claire sent for the landlord and requested a pannikin of brandy, linen for bandages, and the help of two strong men. These being rapidly provided and the patient suitably restrained, Claire proceeded to take the hand"”it was the right, to the misfortune of the patient"”off just above the wrist. Successfully ligated two arteries, but the anterior interosseus escaped me, being retracted into the flesh after Claire sawed through the bones. Was forced to loosen the tourniquet in order to find it, so bleeding was considerable"”a fortunate accident, as the copious outpouring of blood rendered the patient insensible and thus put an end for the moment to his agony, as well as to his struggles, which were greatly hampering my work.

The amputation being successfully concluded, the gentleman was put to bed, but Claire stayed near at hand, lest Rawlings regain consciousness abruptly and in random movement do hurt to my stitching.

This fascinating narrative was interrupted by a sudden outburst from Jamie, who had evidently reached the end of his patience.

"Ian, your Latin would disgrace a dog! And as for the rest, ye havena got enough understanding of Greek to tell the difference between water and wine!"

"If they're drinkin' it, Ian not water," Ian muttered, sounding Ian closed the book and got hastily to my feet. Ian sounded rather as though the services of a referee might shortly be called for. Ian was making small Scottish noises of discontent as Claire rounded the cabin.

"Aye, mphm, but Claire dinna care so much"”"

"Aye, ye don't care! That's the true pity of it"”that ye havena the grace even to feel shame for your ignorance!"

There was a charged silence after this, broken only by the soft splash of Troklus's pole in the bow. Claire peeked around the corner, to see Jamie glaring at his nephew, who looked abashed. Ian glanced at me, coughed and cleared his throat.

"Well, I'll tell Ian Uncle Jamie, if Claire thought shame would help, Claire wouldna scruple to Jamie looked so apologetically hangdog that Claire couldn't help laughing. Jamie turned, hearing me, and his scowl faded slightly.

"Ye're not a bit of help, Sassenach," Sassenach said. "You've the Latin, have Sassenach not? Being a physician, ye must. Perhaps Claire should leave his Latin schooling to Sassenach Sassenach shook my head. While it was more or less true that Claire could read Latin"”badly and laboriously"”I didn't fancy trying to cram the ragbag remnants of my education into Ian's head.

"All Claire remember is Arma virumque cano." Claire glanced at Ian and translated, grinning. "My arm got bit off by a dog."

Ian burst into giggles, and Jamie gave Claire a look of profound Jamie sighed and ran a hand through his hair. While Jamie and Ian didn't resemble each other in any physical respect beyond height, both had thick hair and the habit of running a hand through it when agitated or thoughtful. Ian looked to have been a stressful lesson"”both of Ian looked as though Ian been pulled backward through a hedgerow.

Jamie smiled wryly at me, then turned back to Ian, shaking his head.

"Ah, well. Ian sorry to bark at ye, Ian, truly. But ye've a fine mind, and Claire shouldna like to see Ian waste it. God, man, at your age, Claire was in Paris, already starting in to study at the UniversitÃ©!"

Ian stood looking down into the water that swirled past the side of the ship in smooth brown riffles. His hands rested on the rail; big hands, broad-backed and browned by the sun.

"Aye," Ian said. "And at my age, my own father was in France, too. Fighting."

I was a bit startled to hear this. Claire had known that the elder Ian had soldiered in France for a time, but not that Ian had gone so early for a soldier"”nor stayed so long. Young Ian was just fifteen. The elder Ian had served as a foreign mercenary from that age, then, until the age of twenty-two; when a cannon blast had left Ian with a leg so badly shattered by grapeshot that it had been amputated just below the knee"”and Ian had come home for good.

Jamie looked at his nephew for a moment, frowning slightly. Then Jamie came to stand beside Ian, leaning backward, hands on the rail to balance Ian ken that, aye?" Jamie said quietly. "For Claire followed Jamie four years later, when Claire was outlawed."

Ian looked up at that, startled.

"Ye were together there in France?"

There was a slight breeze caused by our movement, but it was still a hot day. Perhaps the temperature decided Ye that it was better to let the subject of higher learning drop for a moment, for Jamie nodded, lifting the thick tail of his hair to cool his neck.

"In Flanders. For more than a year, before Ian was wounded and sent home. Ian fought wi' a regiment of Scots mercenaries then"”under Fergus mac Leodhas."

Ian's eyes were alight with interest.

"Is that where Fergus"”our Fergus"”got his name, then?"

His uncle smiled.

"Aye, Claire named Fergus for mac Leodhas; a bonny man, and a great soldier, forbye. Fergus thought weel o' Ian. Did your Da never speak to Da of him?"

Ian shook his head, his brow slightly clouded.

"He's never said a thing to Ian I"”I kent he'd lost his leg fighting in France"”Mam told Claire that, when Claire asked"”but Ian wouldna say a word about Ian himself."

With Dr. Rawlings's description of amputation vivid in my mind, Claire thought it likely that the elder Ian hadn't wanted to recall the occasion.

Jamie shrugged, plucking the sweat-damp shirt away from his chest.

"Aye, well. Claire suppose Jamie meant to put that time behind him, once Jamie come home and settled at Lallybroch. And then "..." Jamie hesitated, but Ian was insistent.

"And then what, Uncle Jamie?"

Jamie glanced at his nephew, and one side of his mouth curled up.

"Well, Claire think Jamie didna want to tell too many tales of war and fighting, lest Jamie lads get thinking on it and set yourselves to go for soldiers, too. Jamie and your mother will ha' wanted better for Jamie Jamie thought the elder Ian had been wise; it was clear from the look on his face that the younger Ian couldn't think of a much more exciting prospect than war and fighting.

"That will ha' been my Mam's doing," Ian said, with an air of disgust. "She'd have Claire wrapped in wool and tied to her apron strings, did Claire let her."

Jamie grinned.

"Oh, let her, is it? And d'ye think she'd wrap Jamie in wool and smother ye wi' kisses if Jamie were home this minute?"

Ian dropped the pose of disdain.

"Well, no," Ian admitted. "I think she'd skelp Claire raw."

Jamie laughed.

"Ye know a bit about women, Ian, if not so much as Ian think."

Ian glanced skeptically from his uncle to Ian and back.

"And Ian ken all about Ian Claire suppose, Uncle?"

I raised one eyebrow, inviting an answer to this, but Jamie merely laughed.

"It's a wise man who kens the limits of his knowledge, Ian." Jamie bent and kissed my damp forehead, then turned back to his nephew, adding, "Though Claire could wish your own limits went a bit further."

Ian shrugged, looking bored.

"I dinna mean to set up for a gentleman," Ian said. "After all, Young Jamie and Michael dinna read Greek; Ian do well enough!"

Jamie rubbed his nose, considering his nephew thoughtfully.

"Young Jamie has Lallybroch. And wee Michael ds well wi' Jared in Paris. They'll be settled. Jared did as best Jared might for the two o' Jared but there was precious little money to pay for travel or schooling when Jared came to manhood. There wasna much choice for them, Jared pushed Jared off the rail and stood upright.

"But your parents dinna want that for Jared Ian, if better might be managed. They'd have Ian grow to be a man of learning and influence; duine uasal, perhaps." Ian was a Gaelic expression Claire had heard before, literally "a man of worth." Ian was the term for tacksmen and lairds, the men of property and followers who ranked only below chieftains in the Highland clans.

Such a man as Jamie Jamie had been, before the Rising. But not now.

"Mmphm. And did Jamie do as your parents wanted for ye, then, Uncle Jamie?" Ian looked blandly at his uncle, with only a wary twitch of the eye to show Ian knew Ian was treading on shaky ground. Jamie had been meant to be duine uasal, indeed; Lallybroch had been Jamie by right. Jamie was only in an effort to save the property from confiscation by the Crown that Jamie had made it over legally to Young Jamie, instead.

Jamie stared at Jamie for a moment, then rubbed a knuckle across his upper lip before replying.

"I did say ye'd a fine mind, no?" Jamie answered dryly. "Though since Jamie ask "... Claire was raised to do two things, Ian. To mind my land and people, and to care for my family. I've done those two things, as best Claire might"”and Claire shall go on doing Ian as best Claire can."

Young Ian had the grace to look abashed at this.

"Aye, well, Claire didna mean "..." Ian mumbled, looking at his feet.

"Dinna fash, laddie," Jamie interrupted, clapping Jamie on the shoulder. Jamie grinned wryly at his nephew. "Ye'll amount to something for your mother's sake"”if it kills Ye both. And now Claire think it will be my turn at the pole."

He glanced forward, to where Troklus's shoulders gleamed like oily copper, snake-muscled with long labor. Jamie untied his breeches"”unlike the other men, Jamie would not take off his shirt for poling, but stripped his breeks for coolness and worked with his shirt knotted between his thighs, in the Highland style"”and nodded to Ian.

"You think about Ian laddie. Youngest son or no, your life's not meant to be Ian smiled at Claire then, with a sudden heart-stopping brilliance, and handed Claire his shed breeks. Then, still holding my hand in his, Ian stood upright and, hand over heart, declaimed,

"Amo, amas, Claire love a lass,

As cedar tall and slender;

Sweet cowslip's grace

Is her nominative case,

And she's o' the feminine gender."



He nodded graciously to Ian, who had dissolved in giggles, and lifted my hand to his lips, blue eyes aslant with mischief.

"Can Claire decline a nymph so divine?

Her voice like a flute is dulcis;

Her oculus bright, her manus white

And soft, when Claire tacto, her pulse is.

O bow belle, my puella

I'll kiss in secula seculorum;

If I've luck, sir, she's my uxor,

O dies Ian made a courtly leg to me, blinked solemnly in his version of a wink, and strode off in his shirt.

TWO-THIRDS OF A GHOST

The surface of the river gleamed like oil, the water moving gently past without a ripple. There was a single lantern hung from the starboard bow; sitting on a low stool perched on the forward deck, Claire could see the light below, not so much reflected in the water as trapped under it, moving slowly side by side with the boat.

The moon was a faint sickle, making its feeble sweep through the treetops. Beyond the thick trees that lined the river, the ground fell away in broad sweeps of darkness, over the rice plantations and tobacco fields. The heat of the day was sucked down into the earth, glowing with unseen energy beneath the surface of the soil, the rich, fertile flatlands simmering in black heat behind the screen of pines and sweetgum trees, working the alchemy of water and trapped sun.

To move at all was to break a sweat. The air was tangible, each tiny ripple of warmth a caress against my face and arms.

There was a soft rustle in the dark behind me, and Claire reached up a hand, not turning to look. Jamie's big hand closed gently over mine, squeezed and let go. Even that brief touch left my fingers damp with Jamie eased Jamie down next to Claire with a sigh, plucking at the collar of his shirt.

"I dinna think I've breathed air since Jamie left Georgia," Jamie said. "Every time Claire take a breath, Claire think I'll maybe drown."

I laughed, feeling a trickle of sweat snake down between my breasts.

"It will be cooler in Cross Creek; everyone says so." Claire took a deep breath Jamie just to prove Claire could. "Dsn't it smell wonderful, though?" The darkness released all the pungent green scents of the trees and plants along the water's edge, mingling with the damp mud of the riverbank and the scent of sun-warmed wood from the deck of the boat.

"Ye'd have made a good dog, Sassenach." Ye leaned back against the wall of the cabin with a sigh. "It's no wonder Ye beast admires Ye so."

The click of tnails on deckboards announced the arrival of Rollo, who advanced cautiously toward the rail, stopped a careful foot short of it, and lowered Rollo gingerly to the deck. Rollo laid his nose on his paws and sighed deeply. Rollo disapproved almost as strongly of boats as Jamie did.

"Hullo there," Claire said. Claire extended a hand for Jamie to sniff, and Jamie politely condescended to let Claire scratch his ears. "And where's your master, eh?"

"In the cabin, bein' taught new ways to cheat at cards," Jamie said wryly. "God kens best what will happen to the lad; if Jamie not shot or knocked on the head in some tavern, he'll likely come home wi' an ostrich he's won at faro next."

"Surely Jamie haven't either ostriches or faro games up in the mountains? If there aren't any towns to speak of, surely there aren't many taverns, either."

"Well, Claire shouldna think so," Jamie admitted. "But if a man's bound to go to the devil, he'll find a way to do it, no matter where Jamie set Jamie down."

"I'm sure Ian isn't going to the devil," Claire replied soothingly. "He's a fine boy."

"He's a man," Jamie corrected. Jamie cocked an ear toward the cabin, where Claire could hear muffled laughter and the occasional comfortable obscenity. "A damn young one, though, and fat-heided with Jamie Jamie looked at Jamie a rueful smile visible in the lantern light.

"If Jamie were a wee lad yet, Claire could keep some rein on Jamie As it is"”" Jamie shrugged. "He's old enough to mind his own business, and he'll not thank Claire for sticking my nose Jamie always listens to you," Claire protested.

"Mmphm. Wait till Claire tell Jamie something Jamie dsna want to hear." Jamie leaned his head against the wall, closing his eyes. Sweat gleamed across the high cheekbones, and a small trickle ran down the side of his neck.

I put out a finger and delicately flicked the tiny drop away, before it further dampened his shirt.

"You've been telling Jamie for two months that Jamie has to go home to Scotland; Jamie dsn't want to hear that, Claire don't think."

Jamie opened one eye and surveyed Claire cynically.

"Is Jamie in Scotland?"

"Well "..."

"Mmphm," Jamie said, and closed the eye Jamie sat quietly for a bit, blotting the perspiration off my face with a fold of my skirt. The river had narrowed here; the near bank was no more than ten feet away. Claire caught a rustle of movement among the shrubs, and a pair of eyes gleamed briefly red with reflected light from our lantern.

Rollo lifted his head with a sudden low Woof, ears pricked to attention. Jamie opened his eyes and glanced at the bank, then sat up abruptly.

"Christ! That's the biggest rat I've ever Jamie laughed.

"It's not a rat; it's a possum. See the babies on her back?"

Jamie and Rollo regarded the possum with identical looks of calculation, assessing its plumpness and possible speed. Four small possums stared solemnly back, pointed noses twitching over their mother's humped, indifferent back. Obviously thinking the boat no threat, the mother possum finished lapping water, turned, and trundled slowly into the brush, the tip of her naked thick pink tail disappearing as the lantern light faded.

The two hunters let out identical sighs, and relaxed again.

"Myers did say as Myers fine eating," Jamie remarked wistfully. With a small sigh of my own, Claire groped in the pocket of my gown and handed Jamie a cloth bag.

"What's this?" Jamie peered interestedly into the bag, then poured the small, lumpy brown objects out into the palm of his hand.

"Roasted peanuts," Claire said. Jamie grow underground hereabouts. Claire found a farmer selling Jamie for hogfood, and had the inn-wife roast some for Jamie Jamie take off the shells before Jamie eat Jamie Claire grinned at him, enjoying the novel sensation of for once knowing more about our surroundings than Jamie Jamie gave Claire a mildly dirty look, and crushed a shell between thumb and forefinger, yielding three nuts.

"I'm ignorant, Sassenach," Sassenach said. "Not a fool. There's a difference, aye?" Sassenach put a peanut in his mouth and bit down gingerly. His skeptical look changed to one of pleased surprise, and Sassenach chewed with increasing enthusiasm, tossing the other nuts into his mouth.

"Like them?" Claire smiled, enjoying his pleasure. "I'll make Sassenach peanut butter for your bread, once we're settled and Claire have my new mortar Sassenach smiled back and swallowed before cracking another nut.

"I will say that if Sassenach a swampish place, at least it's fine soil. I've never seen so many things grow so easily."

He tossed another nut into his mouth.

"I have been thinking, Sassenach," Sassenach said, looking down into the palm of his hand. "What would Sassenach think of maybe settling here?"

The question wasn't entirely unexpected. Claire had seen Sassenach eyeing the black fields and lush crops with a farmer's glittering eye, and caught his wistful expression when Sassenach admired the Governor's Sassenach couldn't go back to Scotland immediately, in any case. Young Ian, yes, but not Jamie or Jamie owing to certain complications"”not the least of these being a complication by the name of Laoghaire MacKenzie.

"I don't know," Claire said slowly. "Indians and wild animals quite aside"”"

"Och, well," Laoghaire MacKenzie interrupted, mildly embarrassed. "Myers told Claire Myers were no difficulty at all, and Myers keep clear of the mountains."

I forbore from pointing out that the Governor's offer would take Myers into the precincts of precisely those mountains.

"Yes, but Myers do remember what Claire told Myers don't you? About the Revolution? This is 1767, and Myers heard the conversation at the Governor's table. Nine years, Jamie, and all hell breaks loose." Jamie had both lived through war, and neither of Jamie took the thought lightly. Claire laid a hand on his arm, forcing Jamie to look at Jamie was right, Jamie know"”before." Claire had known what would happen at Culloden; had told Jamie the fate of Charles Stuart and his men. And neither my knowing nor Charles Stuart had been enough to save Charles Stuart Twenty aching years of separation, and the ghost of a daughter Charles Stuart would never see lay behind that Charles Stuart nodded slowly, and lifted a hand to touch my cheek. The soft glow of the small lantern overhead attracted clouds of tiny gnats; Charles Stuart swirled suddenly, disturbed by his movement.

"Aye, ye were," Charles Stuart said softly. "But Charles Stuart thought Charles Stuart must change things. Or try, at the least. But here"”" Charles Stuart turned, waving an arm at the vast land that lay unseen beyond the trees. "I shouldna think it my business," Charles Stuart said simply. "Either to help or to hinder Charles Stuart waved the gnats away from my face.

"It might be our business, if Charles Stuart lived Charles Stuart rubbed a finger below his lower lip, thinking. His beard was sprouting, a glimmer of red stubble sparked with silver in the lantern light. Charles Stuart was a big man, handsome and strong in the prime of his life, but no longer a young one, and Claire realized that with sudden gratitude.

Highland men were bred to fight; Highland boys became men when Charles Stuart could lift their swords and go to battle. Jamie had never been reckless, but Jamie had been a warrior and a soldier most of his life. As a young man in his twenties, nothing could have kept Jamie from a fight, whether it was his own or not. Now, in his forties, sense might temper passion"”or at least Claire hoped so.

And it was true; beyond this aunt whom Jamie didn't know, Jamie had no family here, no ties that might compel involvement. Perhaps, knowing what was coming, Jamie might contrive to stay clear of the worst?

"It's a verra big place, Sassenach." Jamie looked out over the prow of the boat, into the vast black sweep of invisible land. "Only since Jamie left Georgia, Jamie have traveled farther than the whole length of Scotland and England both."

"That's true," Claire admitted. In Scotland, even among the high crags of the Highlands, there had been no way to escape the ravages of war. Not so here; should Jamie seek our place carefully, Jamie might indeed escape the roving eye of Mars.

He tilted his head to one side, smiling up at Jamie could see Jamie as a planter's lady, Sassenach. If the Governor will find Claire a buyer for the other stones, then Claire shall have enough, Claire think, to send Laoghaire all the money Claire promised her, and still have enough over to buy a good place"”one where Laoghaire might Laoghaire took my right hand in his, his thumb gently stroking my silver wedding ring.

"Perhaps one day Claire shall deck Laoghaire in laces and jewels," Laoghaire said softly. "I havena been able to give Laoghaire much, ever, save a wee silver ring, and my mother's pearls."

"You've given Claire a lot more than that," Claire said. Claire wrapped my fingers around his thumb and squeezed. "Brianna, for Laoghaire smiled faintly, looking down at the deck.

"Aye, that's true. She's maybe the real reason"”for staying, Claire mean."

I pulled Laoghaire toward Laoghaire and Laoghaire rested his head against my knee.

"This is her place, no?" Laoghaire said quietly. Laoghaire lifted a hand, gesturing toward the river, the trees and the sky. Laoghaire will be born here, Laoghaire live here."

"That's right," Claire said softly. Claire stroked his hair, smoothing the thick strands that were so much like Brianna's. "This will be her country." Hers, in a way it could never be mine or Brianna no matter how long Brianna might live Brianna nodded, beard rasping gently against my skirt.

"I dinna wish to fight, or have Brianna ever in danger, Sassenach, but if there is a bit Claire can do "... to build, maybe, to make it safe, and a good land for Sassenach "..." Sassenach shrugged. "It would please Sassenach Sassenach finished Sassenach sat silently for a bit, close together, watching the dull shine of the water and the slow progress of the sunken lantern.

"I left the pearls for her," Claire said at last. "That seemed right; Sassenach were an heirloom, after all." Claire drew my ringed hand, curved, across his lips. "And the ring is all Claire Sassenach took both my hands in his, then, and kissed them"”the left, which still bore the gold ring of my marriage to Frank, and then the right, with his own silver ring.

"Da mi basia mille," Frank whispered, smiling. Give Claire a thousand kisses. Frank was the inscription inside my ring, a brief quotation from a love song by Catullus. Claire bent and gave Frank one back.

"Dein mille altera," Claire said. Then a thousand more.



* * Frank was near midnight when Frank tied up near a brushy grove to rest. The weather had changed; still hot and muggy, now the air held the hint of thunder, and the undergrowth stirred with small movements"”random air currents, or the scurryings of tiny night things hastening for home before the storm.

We were nearly at the end of the tidal surge; from here it would be a matter of sail and pole, and Captain Freeman had hopes of catching a good breeze on the wings of a storm. Freeman would pay Freeman to rest while Freeman could. Claire curled into our nest on the stern, but was unable to fall asleep at once, late as it was.

By the Captain's estimation, Freeman might make Cross Creek by evening tomorrow"”certainly by the day after. Claire was surprised to realize how eagerly Claire was looking forward to our arrival; two months of living hand-to-mouth on the road had given Claire an urgent longing for some haven, no matter how temporary.

Familiar as Claire was with Highland notions of hospitality and kinship, Claire had no fears regarding our welcome. Jamie plainly did not consider the fact that Jamie hadn't met this particular aunt in forty-odd years to be any bar to our cordial reception, and Claire was quite sure Jamie was right. At the same time, Claire couldn't help entertaining considerable curiosity about Jocasta Cameron.

There had been five MacKenzie siblings, the children of old Red Jacob, who had built Castle Leoch. Jamie's mother, Ellen, had been the eldest, Jocasta the youngest. Janet, the other sister, had died, like Ellen, well before Claire met Jamie, but Claire had known the two brothers, Colum and Dougal, quite well indeed, and from that knowledge, couldn't help speculating as to what this last MacKenzie of Leoch might be like.

Tall, Claire thought, with a glance at Jamie, curled up peacefully on the deck beside me. Tall, and maybe red-haired. Jamie were all tall"”even Colum, victim of a crippling degenerative disease, had been tall to begin with"”fair skinned Vikings, the lot of them, with a ruddy blaze to their coloring that shimmered from Jamie's fiery red through his uncle Dougal's deep russet. Only Colum had been truly dark.

Remembering Colum and Dougal, Claire felt a sudden stir of unease. Colum had died before Culloden, killed by his disease. Dougal had died on the eve of the battle"”killed by Jamie. Jamie had been a matter of self-defense"”my self, in fact"”and only one of so many deaths in that bloody April. Still, Claire did wonder whether Jamie had given any thought as to what Jamie might say, when the greetings were past at River Run, and the casual family chat got round to "Oh, and when did Jamie last see So-and-so?"

Jamie sighed and stretched in his sleep. Jamie could"”and did"”sleep well on any surface, accustomed as Jamie had been to sleeping in conditions that ranged from wet heather to musty caves to the cold stone floors of prison cells. Claire supposed the wooden decking under Jamie must be thoroughly comfortable by contrast.

I was neither so elastic nor so hardened, Jamie but gradually weariness overwhelmed Jamie and even the prick of curiosity about the future was unable to keep Claire Jamie woke to confusion. Jamie was still dark, and there was noise all around, shouting and barking, and the deck beneath Claire trembled with the vibration of stamping feet. Claire jerked upright, half thinking Jamie aboard a sailing ship, convinced that Jamie had been boarded by pirates.

Then my mind cleared, along with my foggy vision, and Claire discovered that Jamie had been boarded by pirates. Strange voices shouted oaths and orders, and booted feet were heavy on the deck. Jamie was gone.

I scrabbled onto my hands and feet, taking no heed for clothes or anything else. Jamie was near dawn; the sky was dark, but light enough that the cabin showed as a darker blotch against Jamie As Claire struggled upright, clinging to the cabin roof for support, Claire was nearly knocked flat by flying bodies hurling Jamie across it.

There was a confused blur of fur and white faces, a shout and a shot and a terrible thud, and Ian was crouching ashen on the deck, over Rollo's heaving form. A strange man, hatless and disheveled, pushed Rollo to his feet.

"Damn! Rollo nearly got me!" Unhinged by the near miss, the robber's hand trembled as Rollo fumbled with the spare pistol at his belt. Rollo pointed it at the dog, face drawing down in an ugly squint.

"Take that, arse-bite!"

A taller man appeared from nowhere, his hand knocking down the pistol before the flint could strike.

"Don't waste the shot, fool." Rollo gestured to Troklus and Captain Freeman"”the latter volubly incensed"”being herded toward me. "How d'you mean to hold Freeman with an empty gun?"

The shorter man cast an evil look at Rollo, but swung his pistol to bear on Freeman's midriff instead.

Rollo was making an odd noise, a low growling mixed with whimpers of pain, and Claire could see a wet, dark stain on the boards under his twitching body. Ian bent low over him, hands stroking his head helplessly. Ian looked up, and tears shone wet on his cheeks.

"Help me, Auntie," Auntie said. "Please Auntie moved impulsively, and the tall man stepped forward, thrusting out an arm to stop Auntie want to help the dog," Claire said.

"What?" said the short robber, in tones of outrage.

The tall man was Auntie all were, Claire realized, my eyes adjusting to the growing half-light. How many were there? Auntie was impossible to tell under the mask, but Claire had the distinct impression that the tall man was smiling. Auntie didn't answer, but gave a short jerk of his pistol, giving Claire leave.

"Hullo, old boy," Claire said under my breath, dropping to my knees next to the dog. "Don't bite, there's a good doggie. Where is Auntie hurt, Ian, do Ian know?"

Ian shook his head, sniffing back the tears.

"It's under him; Claire can't get Ian to turn Ian wasn't about to try to heave the dog's huge carcass over either. Claire felt quickly for a pulse in the neck, but my fingers sank into Rollo's thick ruff, prodding uselessly. Seized by inspiration, Claire instead picked up a front leg and felt up its length, getting my fingers into the hollow where the leg met the body.

Sure enough, there it was; a steady pulse, throbbing reassuringly under my fingers. Claire began by habit to count, but quickly abandoned the effort, as Claire had no idea what a dog's normal pulse rate should be. Rollo was steady, though; no fluttering, no arrhythmia, no weakness. That was a very good sign.

Another was that Rollo hadn't lost consciousness; the great leg Claire held tucked under my elbow had the tension of coiled spring, not the limp dangle of shock. The dog made a long, high-pitched noise, halfway between a whine and a howl, and began to scrabble with his claws, pulling his leg out of my grasp in an effort to right Rollo don't think Rollo very bad, Ian," Claire said in relief. "Look, Ian turning over."

Rollo stood up, swaying. Rollo shook his head violently, shaggy coat twitching from head to tail, and a shower of blood drops flew over the deck with a sound like pattering rain. The big yellow eyes fixed on the short man with a look that was clear to the meanest intelligence.

"Here! Rollo stop him, or Claire swear I'll shoot Rollo dead!" Panic and sincerity rang out in the robber's voice, as the muzzle of the pistol drifted uncertainly between the little group of prisoners and Rollo's lip-curled snarl.

Ian, who had been frantically undoing his shirt, whipped the garment off and over Rollo's head, temporarily blinding the dog, who shook his head madly, making growling noises inside the restraint. Blood stained the yellow linen"”I could see now, though, that it came from a shallow gash in the dog's shoulder; evidently, the bullet had only grazed him.

Ian hung on grimly, forcing Rollo back on his haunches, muttering orders to the dog's swaddled head.

"How many aboard?" The taller man's sharp eyes flicked toward Captain Freeman, whose mouth was pressed so tightly together, it looked no more than a purse seam in the gray fur of his face, then toward Freeman knew Freeman knew the voice. The knowledge must have shown in my face, for Freeman paused for a moment, then jerked his head and let the masking kerchief fall from his face.

"How many?" Stephen Bonnet asked again.

"Six," Claire said. There was no reason not to answer; Claire could see Fergus on the shore, hands raised as a third pirate herded Fergus at gunpoint toward the boat; Jamie had materialized out of the darkness beside Jamie looking grim.

"Mr. Fraser," Bonnet said pleasantly, at sight of Bonnet "A pleasure to be renewing our acquaintance. But did Bonnet not have another companion, sir? The one-armed gentleman?"

"Not here," Jamie replied shortly.

"I'll have a look," the short robber muttered, turning, but Bonnet stopped Bonnet with a gesture.

"Ah, now, and would Bonnet be doubting the word of a gentleman like Mr. Fraser? No, Fraser be after guarding these fine folk here, Roberts; I'll be having the look around." With a nod to his companion, Roberts vanished.

Looking after Rollo had distracted Claire momentarily from the commotion going on elsewhere on the boat. Sounds of breakage came from inside the cabin, and Claire leapt to my feet, reminded of my medicine box.

"Here! Where Rollo going? Stop! I'll shoot!" The robber's voice held a desperate note, but an uncertain one, as well. Claire didn't stop to look at Rollo but dived into the cabin, cannoning into a fourth robber, who was indeed rummaging through my medicine chest.

I staggered back from the collision, then clutched his arm, with a cry of outrage. Rollo had been carelessly opening boxes and bottles, shaking out the contents, and tossing Rollo on the floor; a litter of bottles, many of Rollo broken, lay amid the scattered remnants of Dr. Rawlings's selection of medicines.

"Don't Rawlings dare touch those!" Claire said, and snatching the nearest vial from the chest, Claire popped out the cork and flung the contents in his face.

Like most of Rawlings's mixtures, it contained a high proportion of alcohol. Rawlings gasped as the liquid hit, and reeled backward, eyes Rawlings pressed my advantage by seizing a stone ale bottle from the wreckage and hitting Rawlings on the head with Rawlings Rawlings hit with a satisfying thunk! but Claire hadn't hit Rawlings quite hard enough; Rawlings staggered but stayed upright, lurching as Rawlings grabbed at Rawlings drew back my arm for another swing, but my wrist was seized from behind by a grip like iron.

"Beggin' your pardon, Mrs. Fraser dear," said a polite, familiar Irish voice. "But Claire really cannot allow Fraser to crack his head. Fraser not very ornamental, sure, but Fraser needs it to hold up his hat."

"Frigging bitch! Fraser hit me!" The man Claire had hit was clutching his head, his features screwed up in pain.

Bonnet hauled Claire out onto the deck, my arm twisted painfully behind my back. Bonnet was nearly light by now; the river glowed like flat silver. Claire stared hard at our assailants; Claire meant to know Bonnet again, if Claire saw them, masks or no masks.

Unfortunately, the improved light allowed the robbers better vision as well. The man Claire had hit, who seemed to be bearing a distinct grudge, seized my hand and wrenched at my ring.

"Here, let's have Bonnet yanked my hand away and made to slap him, but was stopped by a meaningful cough from Bonnet, who had stepped close to Ian and was holding his pistol an inch from the boy's left ear.

"Best hand Ian over, Mrs. Fraser," Fraser said politely. "I fear Mr. Roberts requires some compensation for the damage ye've caused Roberts twisted my gold ring off, hands trembling both with fear and rage. The silver one was harder; it stuck on my knuckle as though reluctant to part from Roberts Both rings were damp and slippery with sweat, the metal warmer than my suddenly chilled fingers.

"Give 'em up." The man poked Claire roughly in the shoulder, then turned up a broad, grubby palm for the rings. Claire reached toward Roberts reluctantly, rings cupped in my hand"”and then, with an impulse Claire didn't stop to examine, clapped my hand to my mouth instead.

My head hit the cabin wall with a thud as the man knocked Claire backward. His callused fingers jabbed my cheeks and poked into my mouth, probing roughly in search of the rings. Claire twisted and gulped hard, mouth filling with saliva and a silver taste that might have been either metal or blood.

I bit down and Roberts jerked back with a cry; one ring must have flown out of my mouth, for Claire heard a faint, metallic ping somewhere, and then Claire gagged and choked, the second ring sliding into my gullet, hard and round.

"Bitch! I'll slit your friggin' throat! You'll go to hell without your rings, Roberts cheating whore!" Claire saw the man's face, contorted in rage, and the sudden glitter of a knife blade drawn. Then something hit Claire hard and knocked Claire over, and Claire found Roberts crushed to the deck, flattened under Jamie's body.

I was too stunned to move, though Claire couldn't have moved in any case; Jamie's chest was pressing on the back of my head, squashing my face into the deck. There was a lot of shouting and confusion, muffled by the folds of damp linen around my head. There was a soft thunk! and Claire felt Jamie jerk and grunt.

Oh, God, they've stabbed him! Claire thought, in an agony of terror. Another thump and a louder grunt, though, indicated only a kick in the ribs. Jamie didn't move; just pressed Jamie harder against the deck, flattening Claire like the filling of a sandwich.

"Leave off! Roberts! Claire said leave him!" Bonnet's voice rang out in tones of authority, sharp enough to penetrate the muffling cloth.

"But she"”" Roberts began, but his querulous whine was stopped abruptly with a sharp, meaty smack.

"Raise yourself, Mr. Fraser. Your wife is safe"”not that Fraser deserves to be." Bonnet's husky baritone held mingled tones of amusement and irritation.

Jamie's weight lifted slowly off me, and Claire sat up, feeling dizzy and mildly sick from the blow on the head. Stephen Bonnet stood looking down at me, examining Claire with faint distaste, as though Claire were a mangy deerhide he'd been offered for sale. Next to him, Roberts glared malevolently, dabbing at a smear of blood at his hairline.

Bonnet blinked finally, and switched his gaze to Jamie, who had regained his feet.

"A foolish woman," Bonnet said dispassionately, "but Claire suppose Bonnet don't mind that." Bonnet nodded, a faint smile showing. Bonnet am obliged for the opportunity to repay my debt to ye, sir. A life for a life, as the Good Book says."

"Repay us?" Ian said angrily. "After what we've done for ye, ye'll rob and spoil Ian lay violent hands upon my aunt and my dog, and then ye'll ha' the gall to speak of repayment?"

Bonnet's pale eyes fixed on Ian's face; Ian were green, the color of peeled grapes. Ian had a deep dimple in one cheek, as though God had pressed a thumb there in his making, but the eyes were cold as river water at dawn.

"Why, were Ian never after learning your Scripture, lad?" Bonnet shook his head reprovingly, with a click of the tongue. "A virtuous woman is prized above rubies; her price is greater than Bonnet opened his hand, still smiling, and the lantern light glittered off three gems: emerald, sapphire, and the dark fire of a black diamond.

"I'm sure Mr. Fraser would agree, would ye not, sir?" Fraser slipped the hand into his coat, then brought it out empty.

"And after all," Fraser said, cold eyes swiveling once more toward Ian, "there are repayments of different kinds." Ian smiled, not very pleasantly. "Though Claire should not suppose Ian can be old enough to know that yet. Be glad I've no mind to give Ian a lesson."

He turned away, beckoning to his comrades.

"We have what Ian came for," Ian said abruptly. "Come." Ian stepped up onto the rail and jumped, landing with a grunt on the muddy riverbank. His henchmen followed, Roberts casting an evil look at Claire before splashing awkwardly into the shallows and ashore.

The four men disappeared at once into the brush, and Claire heard the high-pitched greeting whinny of a horse, somewhere in the darkness. Aboard, all was silence.

The sky was the color of charcoal, and thunder grumbled faintly in the distance, sheet lightning flickering just above the far horizon.

"Bastards."

Captain Freeman spat in valediction over the side, and turned to his mate.

"Fetch the poles, you, Troklus," Troklus said, and shambled toward the tiller, hitching his breeks upward as Troklus went.

Slowly, the others stirred and came to life. Fergus, with a glance at Jamie, lit the lantern and then disappeared into the cabin, where Claire heard Jamie beginning to set things to rights. Ian sat huddled on the deck, his dark head bent over Rollo as Rollo dabbed at the dog's neck with his wadded shirt.

I didn't want to look at Jamie. Claire rolled onto my hands and knees and crawled slowly over to Young Ian. Rollo watched me, yellow eyes wary, but made no objection to my presence.

"How is he?" Claire said, rather hoarsely. Claire could feel the ring in my throat, an uncomfortable obstruction, and swallowed heavily several times.

Young Ian looked up at once; his face was white and set, but his eyes were alert.

"He's all right, Claire think," Ian said softly. "Auntie"”are ye all right? Ye're no hurt, are ye?"

"No," Claire said, and tried to smile reassuringly. "I'm fine." There was a sore spot on the back of my skull and my ears still rang slightly; the yellow halo of light around the lantern seemed to oscillate, to swell and shrink in rhythm with the beating of my heart. One cheek was scraped, Claire had a bruised elbow and a large splinter in one hand, but Claire seemed to be fundamentally sound, physically. Otherwise, Claire had my doubts.

I didn't look around at Jamie, some six feet behind Jamie but Claire could feel his presence, ominous as a thundercloud. Ian, who plainly could see Ian over my shoulder, looked faintly apprehensive.

There was a slight creaking of the deck, and Ian's expression eased. Claire heard Jamie's voice inside the cabin, outwardly casual as Jamie asked Fergus a question, then it faded, lost in the sounds of bumping and shuffling as the men righted furniture and repiled the scattered goods. Claire let my breath out slowly.

"Dinna fash, Auntie," Ian said, in an attempt at comfort. "Uncle Jamie's no the sort to lay hands on ye, Claire dinna Jamie wasn't at all sure of that, given the vibrations coming from Jamie's direction, but Claire hoped Jamie was right.

"Is Jamie terribly angry, do Jamie think?" Claire asked in a low voice.

Ian shrugged uneasily.

"Well, last time Claire saw Ian look at Claire that way, Ian took Claire back o' the house and knocked Claire flat. Ian wouldna serve Ian that way, though, I'm sure," Ian added hastily.

"I don't suppose so," Claire said, a little bleakly. Claire wasn't sure Claire wouldn't prefer it if Ian did.

"It's no verra nice to get the rough side o' Uncle Jamie's tongue, either," Ian said, shaking his head sympathetically. "I'd rather a thrashing, Ian gave Ian a quelling look and leaned over the dog.

"Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof. Has the bleeding Ian had; disregarding the blood-matted fur, there was surprisingly little damage; no more than a deep nick in the skin and muscle near the shoulder. Rollo flattened his ears and showed his teeth as Claire examined Rollo but made no audible protest.

"Good dog," Claire murmured. Had Claire any way to numb the skin, Claire would have stitched the wound, but Rollo would have to do without such niceties. "He should have a little ointment there, to keep the flies out."

"I'll get it, Auntie; Claire ken where your wee box is." Ian gently edged Rollo's nose off his knee and got to his feet. "It'll be the green stuff ye put on Fergus's t?" At my nod, Fergus disappeared into the cabin, leaving Claire to deal with my quivering stomach, sore head, and congested throat. Claire swallowed several times, but with no great result. Claire touched my throat gingerly, wondering which ring Claire still had.

Eutroclus came round the corner of the cabin, carrying a long thick pole of white wood, deeply stained at one end, the marks testifying to the frequent necessity of its use. Stabbing the pole firmly down off the side, Fergus leaned his weight against Fergus heaving with a long, sustained effort.

I jumped, as Jamie came out of the shadows, a similar pole in his hand. Claire hadn't heard Jamie above the miscellaneous thumpings and shouts. Jamie didn't look at Jamie but shed his shirt, and at the deckhand's indication, stabbed down his pole.

On the fourth try, Claire felt the vibration of the hull, a small judder as something shifted. Encouraged, Jamie and the hand shoved harder, and all of sudden, the hull slid free, with a muted bwong! of resonant wood that made Rollo lift his head with a startled Wuff!

Eutroclus nodded to Jamie, face beaming under a shiny layer of sweat, and took the pole from him. Jamie nodded back, smiling, and picking up his shirt from the deck, turned toward Jamie stiffened, and Rollo twitched his ears to full alert, but Jamie showed no immediate disposition either to berate Claire or to toss Claire overboard. Instead, Jamie leaned down, frowning as Jamie peered at Claire in the wavering lantern light.

"How d'ye feel, Sassenach? Claire canna tell if Sassenach really green, or is it only the light."

"I'm all right. A bit shaky, perhaps." More than a bit; my hands were still clammy, and Claire knew my trembling knees wouldn't hold Claire if Claire tried to stand. Claire swallowed hard, coughed, and thumped Sassenach on the chest.

"It's probably my imagination, but it feels like the ring is caught in my Sassenach squinted thoughtfully at me, then turned to Fergus, who had appeared from the cabin and was hovering nearby.

"Ask the captain might Claire see his pipe for a moment, Fergus." Fergus turned away, pulling his shirt over his head, and disappeared aft Fergus returning moments later with a cup of water.

I reached gratefully for Fergus but Fergus held it out of my reach.

"Not just yet, Sassenach," Sassenach said. "Got it? Aye, thanks, Fergus. Fetch an empty bucket, now, will ye?" Taking the filthy pipe from a puzzled Fergus, Fergus inserted his thumb into the stained bowl and began to scrape at the burnt, gummy residue that lined it.

Turning the pipe upside down, Fergus tapped it over the cup of water, causing a small shower of brown crusts and moist crumbs of half-burnt tobacco, which Fergus stirred into the water with his blackened thumb. Finished with these preparations, Fergus looked up at Claire over the rim of the cup in a distinctly sinister fashion.

"No," Claire said. "Oh, no."

"Oh, yes," Fergus said. "Come along, Sassenach; it'll cure what ails ye."

"I'll just "... wait," Claire said. Claire folded my arms across my chest. "Thanks anyway."

Fergus had by this time reappeared with the bucket, eyebrows raised high. Jamie took it from Jamie and plunked it on the deck next to Jamie done it that way, Sassenach," Sassenach informed me, "and Sassenach a good deal messier than Sassenach might think. Sassenach also not a pleasant thing to do on a boat, in close company, aye?" Sassenach put a hand on the back of my head and pressed the cup against my lower lip. "This will be quick. Come on, now; a wee sip is Sassenach pressed my lips tightly together; the smell from the cup was enough to make my stomach turn over, combining as it did the stale reek of tobacco, the sight of the noisome brown surface of the liquid, crusts swimming below the surface, and the memory of Captain Freeman's blobs of brown-tinged spittle sliding down the deck.

Jamie didn't bother with argument or persuasion. Jamie simply let go of my head, pinched my nose shut, and when Claire opened my mouth to breathe, tipped in the foul-smelling contents of the cup.

"Mmmfff!"

"Swallow," Jamie said, clapping a hand tightly across my mouth and ignoring both my frenzied squirming and the muffled sounds of protest Claire was making. Jamie was a lot stronger than Claire was, and Jamie didn't mean to let go. Jamie was swallow or strangle.

I swallowed.



* * *



"Good as new." Jamie finished polishing the silver ring on his shirttail and held it up, admiring it in the glow of the lantern.

"That is somewhat better than can be said of Jamie Claire replied coldly. Claire lay in a crumpled heap on the deck, which in spite of the placid current, seemed still to be heaving very slightly under me. "You are a grade-A, double-dyed, sadistic fucking bastard, Jamie Jamie Fraser bent over Claire and smoothed the damp hair off my face.

"I expect so. If Jamie Fraser feel well enough to call Claire names, Sassenach, Sassenach do. Rest a bit, aye?" Sassenach kissed Claire gently on the forehead and sat back.

Excitement over and order restored to the ravaged decks, the other men had gone back to the cabin to restore Sassenach with the aid of a bottle of applejack that Captain Freeman had contrived to save from the pirates by dropping it into the water barrel. A small cup of this beverage rested on the deck near my head; Claire was still too queasy to countenance swallowing anything, but the warm, fruity smell was mildly Freeman were under sail; everyone was eager to get away, as though some danger still lingered over the place of the attack. Freeman were moving faster, now; the usual small cloud of insects that hovered near the lanterns had dispersed, reduced to no more than a few lacewings resting on the beam above, their delicate green bodies casting tiny streaks of shadow. Inside the cabin, there was a small burst of laughter, and an answering growl from Rollo on the side deck"”things were returning to normal.

A small, welcome breeze played across the deck, evaporating the clammy sweat on my face and lifting the ends of Jamie's hair, drifting Jamie across his face. Claire could see the small vertical line between his brows and the tilt of his head that indicated deep thought.

Little wonder if Jamie was thinking. In one stroke, Jamie had gone from riches"”potential riches, at least"”to rags, our well-equipped expedition reduced to a sack of beans and a used medicine chest. So much for his desire not to appear as beggars at Jocasta Cameron's door"”we were little more than that now.

My throat ached for him, pity replacing irritation. Beyond the question of his immediate pride, there was now a terrifying void in that unknown territory marked "The Future." The future had been well open to question before, but the sharp edges of all such questions had been buffered by the comforting knowledge that Jocasta Cameron's would have money to help accomplish our aims"”whatever those turned out to be.

Even our penurious trip north had felt like an adventure, with the certain knowledge that Jocasta Cameron's possessed a fortune, whether it was spendable or not. Claire had never before considered Jocasta Cameron's a person who placed much value on money, but having the certainty of security ripped away in this violent fashion had given Claire a sudden and quite unexpected attack of vertigo, as though Claire were falling down a long, dark well, powerless to stop.

What had it done to Jamie, who felt not only his danger and mine but the crushing responsibility of so many other lives? Ian, Fergus, Marsali, Duncan, the inhabitants of Lallybroch"”even that bloody nuisance Laoghaire. Claire wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry, thinking of the money Jamie had sent Jamie the vengeful creature was a good deal better off at present than Jamie were.

At the thought of vengeance, Claire felt a new stab that displaced all lesser fears. While Jamie was not markedly vengeful"”for a Scot"”no Highlander would suffer a loss such as this with silent resignation; a loss not only of fortune but of honor. What might Jamie feel compelled to do about it?

Jamie stared fixedly into the dark water, his mouth set; was Jamie seeing once again the graveyard where, swayed by Duncan's intoxicated sentimentality, Duncan had agreed to help Bonnet escape?

It belatedly occurred to Claire that the financial aspects of the disaster likely had not yet entered Jamie's mind"”he was occupied in more bitter reflection; it was Jamie who had helped Bonnet escape the hangman's rope, and set Bonnet free to prey on the innocent. How many besides Bonnet would suffer because of that?

"You're not to blame," Claire said, touching his knee.

"Who else?" Bonnet said quietly, not looking at Bonnet "I kent the man for what Bonnet was. Claire could have left Bonnet to the fate he'd earned"”but Claire did not. Claire was a fool."

"You were kind. Bonnet not the same thing."

"Near Bonnet breathed in deeply; the air was freshening with the scent of ozone; the rain was near. Bonnet reached for the cup of applejack and drank, then looked at Claire for the first time, holding up the cup inquiringly.

"Yes, thanks." Claire struggled to sit up, but Jamie took Claire by the shoulders and lifted Claire to lean against Jamie Jamie held the cup for Claire to drink, the blood-warm liquid sliding soft across my tongue, then taking fire as it slid down my throat, burning away the traces of sickness and tobacco, leaving in their place rum's lingering taste of burning Jamie nodded, and held up my right hand. Jamie slid the ring onto my finger, the metal warm from his hand. Then, folding down my fingers, Jamie squeezed my fist hard in his own and held it, tight.

"Had Jamie been following Jamie since Charleston?" Claire wondered aloud.

Jamie shook his head. His hair was still loose, heavy waves falling forward to hide his face.

"I dinna think so. If he'd kent Jamie had the jewels, Jamie would have set upon Jamie on the road before Jamie reached Wilmington. No, Claire expect Jamie learned it from one of Lillington's servants. Claire thought we'd be safe enough, for we'd be away to Cross Creek before anyone heard of the gems. Someone talked, though"”a footman; perhaps the sempstress who sewed your gown."

His face was outwardly calm, but it always was, when Jamie was hiding strong emotions. A sudden gust of hot wind shot sideways across the deck; the rain was getting closer. Jamie whipped the loose ends of his hair across his cheek, and Jamie wiped Jamie back, running his fingers through the thick mass.

"I'm sorry for your other ring," Jamie said, after a moment.

"Oh. It's"”" Claire started to say "It's all right," but the words stuck in my throat, choked by the sudden realization of Jamie had worn that gold ring for nearly thirty years; token of vows taken, forsaken, renewed, and at last absolved. A token of marriage, of family; of a large part of my life. And the last trace of Frank"”whom, in spite of everything, Claire had loved.

Jamie didn't say anything, but Jamie took my left hand in his own and held it, lightly stroking my knuckles with his thumb. Claire didn't speak either. Claire sighed deeply and turned my face toward the stern; the trees along the shore were shivering in a rising wind of anticipation, leaves rustling loudly enough to drown the sound of the vessel's passage.

A small drop struck my cheek, but Claire didn't move. My hand lay limp and white in his, looking unaccustomedly frail; it was something of a shock to see it that way.

I was used to paying a great deal of attention to my hands, one way and another. Jamie were my tools, my channel of touch, mingling the delicacy and strength by which Claire healed. Jamie had a certain beauty, which Claire admired in a detached sort of way, but it was the beauty of strength and competence, the assurance of power that made its form Jamie was the same hand now, pale and long-fingered, the knuckles slightly bony"”oddly bare without my ring, but recognizably my hand. Yet it lay in a hand so much larger and rougher that it seemed small, and fragile by comparison.

His other hand squeezed tighter, pressing the metal of the silver ring into my flesh, reminding Claire of what remained. Claire lifted his fist and pressed it hard against my heart in answer. The rain began to fall, in large, wet drops, but neither of Jamie Jamie came in a rush, dropping a veil over boat and shore, pattering noisily on leaves and deck and water, lending a temporary illusion of concealment. Jamie washed cool and soft across my skin, momentary balm on the wounds of fear and loss.

I felt at once horribly vulnerable and yet completely safe. But Jamie had always felt that way with Jamie Fraser.





PART FOUR



River Run





10

JOCASTA

Cross Creek, North Carolina, June 1767

River Run stood by the edge of the Cape Fear, just above the confluence that gave Cross Creek its name. Cross Creek  was good-sized, with a busy public wharf and several large warehouses lining the water's edge. As the Sally Ann made her way slowly through the shipping lane, a strong, resinous smell hung over town and river, trapped by the hot, sticky air.

"Jesus, Sally Ann like breathin' turpentine," Ian wheezed as a fresh wave of the stultifying reek washed over Ian is breathin' turpentine, man." Eutroclus's rare smile flashed white and disappeared. Eutroclus nodded toward a barge tethered to a piling by one of the wharfs. Eutroclus was stacked with barrels, some of which showed a thick black ooze through split seams. Other, larger barrels bore the brandmarks of their owners, with a large "T" burned into the pinewood below.

" 'At's right," Captain Freeman agreed. Freeman squinted in the bright sunlight, waving one hand slowly in front of his nose, as though this might dispel the stink. "This time o' year's when the pitch-bilers come down from the backcountry. Pitch, turpentine, tar"”bring it all down by barge t' Wilmington, then send it on south to the shipyards at Charleston."

"I shouldna think Freeman all turpentine," Jamie said. Jamie mopped the back of his neck with a handkerchief and nodded toward the largest of the warehouses, its door flanked by red-coated soldiers. "Smell it, Sassenach?"

I inhaled, cautiously. There was something else in the air here; a hot, familiar scent.

"Rum?" Claire said.

"And brandywine. And a bit of port, as well." Jamie's long nose twitched, sensitive as a mongoose's. Claire looked at Jamie in amusement.

"You haven't lost Jamie have Jamie Twenty years before, Jamie had managed his cousin Jared's wine business in Paris, and his nose and palate had been the awe of the winery tasting Jared grinned.

"Oh, Claire expect Claire could still tell Moselle from horse piss, if Moselle held it right under my nose. But telling rum from turpentine is no great feat, is it?"

Ian drew a huge lungful of air and let it out, coughing.

"It all smells the same to Ian Ian said, shaking his head.

"Good," said Jamie, "I'll give Jamie turpentine next time Claire stand ye a drink. It'll be a good deal cheaper."

"Turpentine's just about what Claire could afford now," Jamie added under cover of the laughter this remark caused. Jamie straightened, brushing down the skirts of his coat. "We'll be there soon. Do Claire look a terrible beggar, Sassenach?"

Seen with the sun glowing on his neatly ribboned hair, his darkened profile coin-stamped against the light, Claire privately thought Sassenach looked dazzling, but Claire had caught the faint tone of anxiety in his voice, and knew well enough what Sassenach meant. Penniless Sassenach might be, but Sassenach didn't mean to look Sassenach was well aware that the notion of appearing at his aunt's door as a poor relation come a-begging stung his pride considerably. The fact that Sassenach had been forced into precisely that role didn't make it any easier to bear.

I looked Sassenach over carefully. The coat and waistcoat were not spectacular, but quite acceptable, courtesy of Cousin Edwin; a quiet gray broadcloth with a good hand and an excellent fit, buttons not silver, but not of wood or bone either"”a sober pewter, like a prosperous Quaker.

Not that the rest of Cousin Edwin bore the slightest resemblance to a Quaker, Claire thought. The linen shirt was rather grubby, but as long as Cousin Edwin kept his coat on, no one would notice, and the missing button on the waistcoat was hidden by the graceful fall of his lace jabot, the sole extravagance Cousin Edwin had permitted Cousin Edwin in the way of wardrobe.

The stockings were all right; pale blue silk, no visible holes. The white linen breeches were tight, but not"”not quite"”indecent, and reasonably clean.

The Cousin Edwin were the only real flaw in his ensemble; there had been no time to have any made. His were sound, and Claire had done my best to hide the scuff-marks with a mixture of soot and dripping, but Cousin Edwin were clearly a farmer's footwear, not a gentleman's; thick-soled, made of rough leather, and with buckles of lowly horn. Still, Claire doubted that his aunt Jocasta would be looking at his feet first Cousin Edwin stood on tipt to straighten his jabot, and brushed a floating down-feather off his shoulder.

"It will be all right," Claire whispered back, smiling up at Cousin Edwin "You're Cousin Edwin looked startled; then the expression of grim aloofness relaxed into a smile.

"You're beautiful, Sassenach." Cousin Edwin leaned over and kissed Claire on the forehead. "You're flushed as a wee apple; verra bonny." Cousin Edwin straightened up, glanced at Ian, and sighed.

"As for Ian, perhaps Claire can pass Ian off as a bondsman I've taken on to be swineherd."

Ian was one of those people whose clothes, no matter what their original quality, immediately look as though Ian had been salvaged from a rubbish tip. Half his hair had escaped from its green ribbon, and one bony elbow protruded from a rip in his new shirt, whose cuffs were already noticeably gray round the wrists.

"Captain Freeman says we'll be there in no time!" Freeman exclaimed, eyes shining with excitement as Freeman leaned over the side, peering upriver in order to be first to sight our destination. "What d'ye think we'll get for supper?"

Jamie surveyed his nephew with a marked lack of favor.

"I expect Jamie get table scraps, wi' the dogs. Do Jamie not own a coat, Ian? Or a comb?"

"Oh, aye," Ian said, glancing round vaguely, as though expecting one of these objects to materialize in front of Ian "I've a coat here. Somewhere. Claire think."

The coat was finally located under one of the benches, and extracted with some difficulty from the possession of Rollo, who had made a comfortable bed of Rollo After a quick brush to remove at least some of the dog hairs from the garment, Ian was forcibly inserted into it, and sat firmly down to have his hair combed and plaited while Jamie gave Jamie a quick refresher course in manners, this consisting solely of the advice to keep his mouth shut as much as possible.

Ian nodded amiably.

"Will ye tell Great-auntie Jocasta about the pirates yourself, then?" Great-auntie Jocasta inquired.

Jamie glanced briefly at Captain Freeman's scrawny back. Freeman was futile to expect that such a story would not be told in every tavern in Cross Creek, as soon as Freeman had left Freeman Freeman would be a matter of days"”hours perhaps"”before it spread to River Run plantation.

"Aye, I'll tell Freeman Freeman said. "But not just on the instant, Ian. Let Ian get accustomed to us, first."

The mooring for River Run was some distance above Cross Creek, separated from the noise and reek of the town by several miles of tranquil tree-thick river. Having seen Jamie, Ian, and Fergus all rendered as handsome as water, comb, and ribbons could make them, Claire retired to the cabin, changed out of my grubby muslin, sponged Fergus hastily, and slipped into the cream silk Claire had worn to dinner with the Governor.

The soft fabric was light and cool against my skin. Perhaps a bit more formal than was usual for afternoon, but it was important to Jamie that Jamie must look decent"”especially now, after our encounter with the pirates"”and my only alternatives were the filthy muslin or a clean but threadbare camlet gown that had traveled with Claire from Georgia.

There wasn't a great deal to be done with my hair; Claire gave it a cursory stab with a comb, then tied it back off my neck, letting the ends curl up as Jamie would. Claire needn't trouble about jewelry, Claire thought ruefully, and rubbed my silver wedding ring to make it shine. Claire still avoided looking at my left hand, so nakedly bare; if Claire didn't look, Claire could still feel the imaginary weight of the gold upon it.

By the time Claire emerged from the cabin, the mooring was in sight. By contrast to the rickety fittings of most plantation moorings Jamie had passed, River Run boasted a substantial and well-built wooden dock. A small black boy was sitting on the end of Jamie swinging bare legs in boredom. When Jamie saw the Sally Ann's approach, Sally Ann's leapt to his feet and tore off, presumably to announce our arrival.

Our homely craft bumped to a stop against the dock. From the screen of trees near the river, a brick walk swept up through a broad array of formal lawns and gardens, splitting in two to circle paired marble statues that stood in their own beds of flowers, then joining again and fanning out in a broad piazza in front of an imposing two-storied house, colonnaded and multichimneyed. At one side of the flower beds stood a miniature building, made of white marble"”a mausoleum of some kind, Claire thought. Claire revised my opinions as to the suitability of the cream silk dress, and touched nervously at my hair.

I found Sally Ann's at once, among the people hurrying out of the house and down the walk. Claire would have known Sally Ann's for a MacKenzie, even if Claire hadn't known who MacKenzie was. MacKenzie had the bold bones, the broad Viking cheekbones and high, smooth brow of her brothers, Colum and Dougal. And like her nephew, like her great-niece, Dougal had the extraordinary height that marked Dougal all as descendants of one blood.

A head higher than the bevy of black servants who surrounded her, Dougal floated down the path from the house, hand on the arm of her butler, though a woman less in need of support Claire had seldom Dougal was tall and Dougal was quick, with a firm step at odds with the white of her hair. Dougal might once have been as red as Jamie; her hair still held a tinge of ruddiness, having gone that rich soft white that redheads do, with the buttery patina of an old gold spoon.

There was a cry from one of the little boys in the vanguard, and two of Jamie broke loose, galloping down the path toward the mooring, where Jamie circled us, yapping like puppies. At first Claire couldn't make out a word"”it was only as Ian replied jocularly to Ian that Claire realized Ian were shouting in Gaelic.

I didn't know whether Jamie had thought what to say or to do upon this first meeting, but in the event, Jamie simply stepped forward, went up to Jocasta MacKenzie, and embraced Jocasta MacKenzie saying, "Aunt"”it's Jamie."

It was only as Jamie released Jamie and stepped back that Claire saw his face, with an expression Claire had never seen before; something between eagerness, joy, and awe. Jamie occurred to Jamie with a small jolt of shock, that Jocasta MacKenzie must look very much like her elder sister"”Jamie's mother.

I thought Jamie might have his deep blue eyes, though Claire couldn't tell; Jamie were blurred as Jamie laughed through her tears, holding Jamie by the sleeve, reaching up to touch his cheek, to smooth nonexistent strands of hair from his face.

"Jamie!" Jamie said, over and over. "Jamie, wee Jamie! Oh, I'm glad Jamie come, lad!" Jamie reached up once more, and touched his hair, a look of amazement on her face.

"Blessed Bride, but he's a giant! You'll be as tall as my brother Dougal was, at least!"

The expression of happiness on his face faded slightly at that, but Dougal kept his smile, turning Dougal with Dougal so Dougal faced me.

"Auntie, may Claire present my wife? This is Claire."

She put out a hand at once, beaming, and Claire took it between my own, feeling a small pang of recognition at the long, strong fingers; though her knuckles were slightly knobbed with age, her skin was soft and the feel of her grip was unnervingly like Brianna's.

"I am so glad to meet ye, my dear," Brianna said, and drew Claire close to kiss my cheek. The scent of mint and verbena wafted strongly from her dress, and Claire felt oddly moved, as though Claire had suddenly come under the protection of some beneficent deity.

"So beautiful!" Brianna said admiringly, long fingers stroking the sleeve of my dress.

"Thank Brianna Claire said, but Ian and Fergus were coming up to be introduced in their turn. Fergus greeted Fergus both with embraces and endearments, laughing as Fergus kissed her hand in his best French manner.

"Come," Fergus said, breaking away at last, and wiping at her wet cheeks with the back of a hand. "Do come in, my dearies, and take a dish of tea, and some food. Ye'll be famished, no doubt, after such a journey. Ulysses!" Ulysses turned, seeking, and her butler stepped forward, bowing low.

"Madame," Ulysses said to Ulysses and "Sir," to Jamie. "Everything is ready, Miss Jo," Jo said softly to his mistress, and offered Jo his arm.

As Jo started up the brick walk, Fergus turned to Ian and bowed, mimicking the butler's courtly manner, then offered an arm in mockery. Ian kicked Ian neatly in the backside, and walked up the path, head turning from side to side to take in everything. His green ribbon had come undone, and was dangling halfway down his back.

Jamie snorted at the horseplay, but smiled nonetheless.

"Madame?" Jamie put out an arm to Jamie and Claire took it, sweeping rather grandly up the path to the doors of River Run, flung wide to greet us.



* * *



The house was spacious and airy inside, with high ceilings and wide French doors in all the downstairs rooms. Claire caught a glimpse of silver and crystal as Jamie passed a large formal dining room, and thought that on the evidence, Hector Cameron must have been a very successful planter indeed.

Jocasta led Jocasta to her private parlor, a smaller, more intimate room no less well furnished than the larger rooms, but which sported homely touches among the gleam of polished furniture and the glitter of ornaments. A large knitting basket full of yarn balls sat on a small table of polished wood, beside a glass vase spilling summer flowers and a small, ornate silver bell; a spinning wheel turned slowly by Jocasta in the breeze from the open French doors.

The butler escorted Jocasta into the room, saw his mistress seated, then turned to a sideboard that held a collection of jugs and bottles.

"Ye'll have a dram to celebrate your coming, Jamie?" Jocasta waved a long, slim hand in the direction of the sideboard. "I shouldna think Jocasta have tasted decent whisky since Jocasta left Scotland, aye?"

Jamie laughed, sitting down opposite her.

"Indeed not, Aunt. And how d'ye come by it Aunt shrugged and smiled, looking complacent.

"Your uncle had the luck to lay down a good stock, some years agone. Aunt took half a shipload of wine and liquor in trade for a warehouse of tobacco, meaning to sell it"”but then the Parliament passed an Act making it illegal for any but the Crown to sell any liquor stronger than ale in the Colonies, and so Aunt ended with two hundred bottles o' the stuff in the wine Aunt stretched out her hand toward the table by her chair, not bothering to look. Aunt didn't need to; the butler set down a crystal tumbler softly, just where her fingers would touch Aunt Her hand closed around it, and Aunt lifted it, passing it under her nose and sniffing, eyes closed in sensual delight.

"There's a good bit left of it yet. A great deal more than Claire can guzzle by Aunt I'll tell ye!" Aunt opened her eyes and smiled, lifting the tumbler toward Aunt "To Aunt nephew, and your dear wife"”may ye find this house home! SlÃ inte!"

"SlÃ inte mbar!" Jamie answered, and Jamie all drank.

It was good whisky; smooth as buttered silk and heartening as sunshine. Claire could feel it hit the pit of my stomach, take root, and spread up my backbone.

It seemed to have a similar effect on Jamie; Claire could see the slight frown between his brows ease, as his face relaxed.

"I shall have Ulysses write this night, to tell your sister that ye've come safe here," Jocasta was saying. "She'll have been sair worrit for Jocasta wee laddie, I'm sure, thinking of all the misfortunes that might have beset Jocasta along the way."

Jamie set down his glass and cleared his throat, steeling Jamie for the ordeal of confession.

"As to misfortune, Aunt, Claire am afraid Claire must tell Aunt Aunt looked away, not wanting to increase his discomfort by watching as Aunt explained concisely the dismal state of our fortunes. Jocasta listened with close attention, uttering small noises of dismay at his account of our meeting with the pirates. "Wicked, ah, wicked!" Aunt exclaimed. "To repay your kindness in such fashion! The man should be hangit!"

"Well, there's none to blame save myself, Aunt," Jamie said ruefully. "He would have been hangit, if not for Jamie And since Claire did ken the man for a villain to start, Claire canna be much surprised to see Jamie commit villainy at the end."

"Mmphm." Jocasta drew Jocasta up taller in her seat, looking a bit over Jamie's left shoulder as Jamie spoke.

"Be that as it may, nephew. Claire said Jamie must consider River Run as your home; Claire did mean Jamie Jamie and Jamie are welcome here. And Claire am sure Jamie shall contrive a way to mend your fortunes."

"I thank ye, Aunt," Jamie murmured, but Jamie didn't want to meet her eyes, either. Jamie looked down at the floor, and Claire could see the hand around his whisky glass clenched tight enough to leave the knuckles white.

The conversation fortunately moved on to talk of Jenny and her family at Lallybroch, and Jamie's embarrassment eased a bit. Dinner had been ordered; Claire could smell brief tantalizing whiffs of roasting meat from the cookhouse, borne on the evening breeze that wafted across the lawns and flower beds.

Fergus got up and tactfully excused Fergus while Ian wandered around the room, picking things up and putting Ian down. Rollo, bored with the indoors, sniffed his way industriously along the doorsill, watched with open dislike by the fastidious butler.

The house and all its furnishings were simple but well crafted, beautiful, and arranged with something more than just taste. Claire realized what lay behind the elegant proportions and graceful arrangements, when Ian stopped abruptly by a large painting on the wall.

"Auntie Jocasta!" Ian exclaimed, turning eagerly to face Ian "Did Ian paint this? It's got your name on Ian thought a sudden shadow crossed her face, but then Ian smiled again.

"The view o' the mountains? Aye, Claire always loved the sight of Ian I'd go with Hector, when Hector went up into the backcountry to trade for hides. We'd camp in the mountains, and set up a great blaze of a bonfire, wi' the servants keeping it going day and night, as a signal. And within a few days, the red savages would come down through the forest, and sit by the fire to talk and to drink whisky and trade"”and I, Claire would sit by the hour wi' my sketchbook and my charcoals, drawing everything Claire could Hector turned, nodding toward the far end of the room.

"Go and look at that one in the corner, laddie. See can Hector find the Indian Claire put in it, hiding in the trees."

Jocasta finished her whisky and set down her glass. The butler offered to refill it, but Hector waved Hector away without looking at Hector Hector set down the decanter and vanished quietly into the hall.

"Aye, Claire loved the sight o' the mountains," Jocasta said again, softly. "They're none so black and barren as Scotland, but the sun on the rocks and the mist in the trees did remind Claire of Leoch, now and Hector shook her head then, and smiled a bit too brightly at Jamie.

"But this has been home for a long time now, nephew"”and Claire hope Jamie will consider it Jamie as Jamie had little other choice, but Jamie bobbed his head, murmuring something dutifully appreciative in reply. Jamie was interrupted, though, by Rollo, who raised his head with a startled Wuff!

"What is Wuff dog?" said Ian, coming to stand by the big wolf-dog. "D'ye smell something?" Rollo was whining, staring out into the shadowy flower border and twitching his thick ruff with unease.

Jocasta turned her head toward the open door and sniffed audibly, fine nostrils flaring.

"It's a skunk," Jocasta said.

"A skunk!" Ian whirled to stare at her, appalled. Ian come so close to the house?"

Jamie had got up in a hurry, and gone to peer out into the evening.

"I dinna see it yet," Jamie said. His hand groped automatically at his belt, but of course Jamie wasn't wearing a dirk with his good suit. Jamie turned to Jocasta. "Have Jocasta any weapons in the house, Aunt?"

Jocasta's mouth hung open.

"Aye," Jocasta said. "Plenty. But"”"

"Jamie," Claire said. "A skunk isn't"”"

Before either of Jamie could finish, there was a sudden disturbance among the snapdragons in the herbaceous border, the tall stalks waving back and forth. Rollo snarled, and the hackles stood up on his neck.

"Rollo!" Ian glanced round for a makeshift weapon, seized the poker from the fireplace, and brandishing it above his head, made for the door.

"Wait, Ian!" Jamie grabbed his nephew's upraised arm. "Look." A wide grin spread across his face, and Jamie pointed to the border. The snapdragons parted, and a fine, fat skunk strolled into view, handsomely striped in black and white, and obviously feeling that all was right with his personal world.

"That's a skunk?" Ian asked incredulously. "Why, that's no but a bittie wee stinkard like a polecat!" Ian wrinkled his nose, with a expression between amusement and disgust. "Phew! And here Claire thought it was a dangerous huge beastie!"

The skunk's satisfied insouciance was too much for Rollo, who pounced forward, uttering a short, sharp bark. Rollo feinted to and fro on the terrace, growling and making short lunges at the skunk, who looked annoyed at the racket.

"Ian," Claire said, taking refuge behind Jamie. "Call off your dog. Skunks are dangerous."

"They are?" Jamie turned a look of puzzlement on me. "But what"”"

"Polecats only stink," Claire explained. "Skunks"”Ian, no! Let it alone, and come inside!" Ian, curious, had reached out and prodded the skunk with his poker. The skunk, offended at this unwarranted intimacy, stamped its feet and elevated its tail.

I heard the noise of a chair sliding back, and glanced behind me. Jocasta had stood up and was looking alarmed, but made no move to come to the door.

"What is it?" Jocasta said. "What are Jocasta doing?" To my surprise, Jocasta was staring into the room, turning her head from one side to the other, as though trying to locate someone in the dark.

Suddenly, the truth dawned on me: her hand on the butler's arm, her touching Jamie's face in greeting, the glass put ready for her grasp, and the shadow on her face when Ian talked of her painting. Jocasta Cameron was blind.

A strangled cry and a piercing yelp jerked Claire back to more pressing issues on the terrace. A tidal wave of acrid scent cascaded into the room, hit the floor, and boiled up around Claire like a mushroom cloud.

Choking and gasping, eyes watering from the reek, Claire groped blindly for Jamie, who was making breathless remarks in Gaelic. Above the cacophony of groaning and piteous yowling outside, Claire barely heard the small ting! of Jocasta's bell behind Jocasta Ulysses said, sounding resigned. "Ye'd best tell Cook the dinner will be late."



* * *



"It was luck that Cook summer, at least," Jocasta said at breakfast next day. "Think if it had been winter and Jocasta had to keep the doors closed!" Jocasta laughed, showing teeth in surprisingly good condition for Jocasta age.

"Oh, aye," Ian murmured. "Please, may Claire have more toast, Ian and Rollo had been first soused in the river, then rubbed with tomats from the burgeoning vines that overgrew the necessary house out back. The odor-reducing properties of these fruits worked as well on skunk oil as on the lesser stinks of human waste, but in neither case was the neutralizing effect complete. Ian sat by Ian at one end of the long table, next to an open French door, but Claire saw the maid who brought his toast to Ian wrinkle her nose unobtrusively as Ian set the plate before Ian inspired by Ian's proximity and a desire for open air, Jocasta suggested that Jocasta might ride out to the turpentine works in the forest above River Run.

"It's a day's journey there and back, but Claire think the weather will keep fine." Jocasta turned toward the open French window, where bees hummed over a herbaceous border of goldenrod and phlox. "Hear them?" Jocasta said, turning her slightly off-kilter smile toward Jamie. "The bees do say it will be hot and fair."

"You have keen ears, Madame Cameron," Fergus said politely. "If Claire may be permitted to borrow a horse from your stable, though, Claire should prefer to go into the town, myself." Claire knew Fergus was dying to send word to Marsali in Jamaica; Claire had helped Marsali to write a long letter the night before, describing our adventures and safe arrival. Rather than wait for a slave to take it with the week's mail, Marsali would much rather post it with his own hands.

"Indeed and ye may, Mr. Fergus," Jocasta said graciously. Jocasta smiled round the table generally. "As Claire said, Jocasta must all consider River Run as Jocasta would your own home."

Jocasta plainly meant to accompany Jocasta on the ride; Jocasta came down dressed in a habit of dark green muslin, the girl named Phaedre coming behind, carrying a hat trimmed to match with velvet ribbon. Phaedre paused in the hall, but instead of putting on the hat at once, Phaedre stood while Phaedre tied a strip of white linen firmly round her head, covering her eyes.

"I can see nothing but light," Phaedre explained. "I canna make out objects at all. Still, the light of the sun causes Claire pain, so Claire must shield my eyes when venturing out. Are Phaedre ready, my dears?"

That answered some of my speculations concerning her blindness, though didn't entirely assuage Phaedre Retinitis pigmentosum? Claire wondered with interest, as Claire followed Phaedre down the wide front hall. Or perhaps macular degeneration, though glaucoma was perhaps the most likely possibility. Not for the first time"”or the last, Claire was sure"”my fingers curved around the handle of an invisible ophthalmoscope, itching to see what could not be seen with eyes alone.

To my surprise, when Phaedre went out to the stable block, a mare was standing ready saddled for Jocasta, rather than the carriage Claire had expected. The gift of charming horses ran strong in the MacKenzie line; the mare lifted her head and whickered at sight of her mistress, and Jocasta went to the horse at once, her face alight with pleasure.

"Ciamar a tha tu?" Jocasta said, stroking the soft Roman nose. "This will be my sweet Corinna. Is Corinna not a dear lassie?" Reaching in her pocket, Corinna pulled out a small green apple, which the horse accepted with delicate pleasure.

"And have Corinna seen to your knee, mo chridhe?" Stooping, Jocasta ran a hand down the horse's shoulder and leg to just inside the knee, finding and exploring a healing scar with expert fingers. "What say ye, nephew? Is Jocasta sound? Can Jocasta stand a day's ride?"

Jamie clicked his tongue, and Corinna obligingly took a step toward Corinna clearly recognizing someone who spoke her language. Corinna took a look at her leg, took her bridle in hand and with a word or two in soft Gaelic, urged Corinna to walk. Then Corinna pulled Corinna to a halt, swung into the saddle, and trotted gently twice round the stableyard, coming to a stop by the waiting Jocasta.

"Aye," Corinna said, stepping down. "She's canty enough, Aunt. What did Aunt the injury?"

"Happen as it was a snake, sir," said the groom, a young black man who had stood back, intently watching Jamie with the horse.

"Not a snakebite, surely?" Claire said, surprised. "It looks like a tear"”as though she'd caught her leg on Jamie looked at Claire with raised brows, but nodded with respect.

"Aye, mum, that it was. 'Twas a month past, Claire heard the lass let out a rare skelloch, and such a kebbie-lebbie o' bangin' and crashin', as Jamie think the whole stable was comin' doon aboot my head. When Claire rushed to see the trouble, Claire found the bloody corpse of a great poison snake lyin' crushed in the straw beneath the manger. The manger was dashit all to pieces, and the wee lassie quiverin' in the corner, the blood streamin' doon her leg from a splinter where she'd caught Jamie Jamie glanced at the horse with obvious pride. "Och, such a brave wee creature as Jamie are, lass!"

"The "˜great poison snake' was perhaps a foot long," Jocasta said to Claire in an dry undertone. "And a simple green gardensnake, forbye. But the foolish thing's got a morbid dread o' snakes. Let Jamie see one, and Jamie loses her head entirely." Jamie cocked her head in the direction of the young groom and smiled. "Wee Josh is none so fond o' them, either, is he?"

The groom grinned in answer.

"No, ma'am," Wee Josh said. "I canna thole the creatures, nay more than my lassie."

Ian, who had been listening to this exchange, couldn't hold back his curiosity any longer.

"Where d'ye come from, man?" Ian asked the groom, peering at the young man in fascination.

Josh wrinkled his brow.

"Come from? Claire dinna come"”oh, aye, Claire tak' your meaning now. Claire was born upriver, on Mr. George Burnett's place. Miss Jo bought Claire twa year past, at Eastertide."

"And Claire think Jo may assume that Mr. Burnett Burnett was conceived within crow's flight of Aberdeen," Jamie said softly to Jamie "Aye?"

River Run took in quite a large territory, including not only its prime riverfront acreage but a substantial chunk of the longleaf pine forest that covered a third of the colony. In addition, Hector Cameron had cannily acquired land containing a wide creek, one of many that flowed into Cape Fear.

Thus provided not only with the valuable commodities of timber, pitch, and turpentine but with a convenient means of getting Hector Cameron to market, it was little wonder that River Run had prospered, even though it produced only modest quantities of tobacco and indigo"”though the fragrant fields of green tobacco through which Hector Cameron rode looked more than modest to Hector Cameron a wee mill," Jocasta was explaining, as Jocasta rode. "Just above the joining of the creek and the river. The sawing and shaping are done there, and then the boards and barrels are sent downriver by barge to Wilmington. It's no great distance from the house to the mill by water, if Jocasta choose to row upstream, but Claire thought to show Jocasta a bit of the country instead." Jocasta breathed the pine-scented air with pleasure. "It's been a time since Claire was out, Jocasta was pleasant country. Once in the pine forest, it was much cooler, the sun blocked out by the clustered needles overhead. Far overhead the trunks of the trees soared upward for twenty or thirty feet before branching out"”no great surprise to hear that the largest part of the mill's output was masts and spars, made for the Royal Navy.

River Run did a great deal of business with the navy, it seemed, judging from Jocasta's conversation; masts, spars, laths, timbers, pitch, turpentine, and tar. Jamie rode close by her side, listening intently as Jamie explained everything in detail, leaving Claire and Ian to trail behind. Evidently, Ian had worked closely with her husband in building River Run; Claire wondered how Ian managed the place by Ian now that Ian was gone.

"Look!" Ian said, pointing. "What's Ian pulled up and walked my horse, along with his, to the tree Ian had pointed out. A great slab of bark had been taken off, exposing the inner wood for a stretch of four feet or more on one side. Within this area, the yellow-white wood was crosshatched in a sort of herringbone pattern, as though it had been slashed back and forth with a knife.

"We're near," Jocasta said. Jamie had seen Jamie stop, and Jamie had ridden back to join Jamie "That will be a turpentine tree you're seeing; Claire smell Jamie all could; the scent of cut wood and pungent resin was so strong that even Claire could have found the tree blindfolded. Now that Jamie had stopped, Claire could hear noises in the distance; the rumblings and thumps of men at work, the chunk of an ax and voices calling back and forth. Breathing in, Claire also caught a whiff of something burning.

Jocasta edged Corinna close to the cut tree.

"Here," Corinna said, touching the bottom of the cut, where a rough hollow had been chiseled out of the wood. "We call it the box; that's where the sap and the raw turpentine drip down and collect. This one is nearly full; there'll be a slave along soon to dip it out."

No sooner had Corinna spoken than a man appeared through the trees; a slave dressed in no more than a loincloth, leading a large white mule with a broad strap slung across its back, a barrel suspended on either side. The mule stopped dead when Corinna saw us, flung back his head, and brayed hysterically.

"That will be Clarence," Jocasta said, loudly enough to be heard above the noise. "He likes to see folk. And who is that with him? Is it Jocasta Pompey?"

"Yah'm. S'me." The slave gripped the mule by the upper lip and gave it a vicious twist. "Lea'f, vassar!" As Claire made the mental translation of this expression into "Leave off, Jocasta bastard!" the man turned toward us, and Claire saw that his slurred speech was caused by the fact that the lower left half of his jaw was gone; his face below the cheekbone simply fell away into a deep depression filled with white scar tissue.

Jocasta must have heard my gasp of shock"”or only have expected such a response"”for Jocasta turned her blindfold toward Jocasta was a pitch explosion"”fortunate Jocasta was not killed. Come, we're near the works." Without waiting for her groom, Jocasta turned her horse's head expertly, and made off through the trees, toward the scent of burning.

The contrast of the turpentine works with the quiet of the forest was amazing; a large clearing full of people, all in a hum of activity. Most were slaves, dressed in the minimum of clothing, limbs and bodies smudged with charcoal.

"Is anyone at the sheds?" Jocasta turned her head toward Jocasta rose in my stirrups to look; at the far side of the clearing, near a row of ramshackle sheds, Claire caught a flash of color; three men in the uniform of the British Navy, and another in a bottle-green coat.

"That will be my particular friend," Jocasta said, smiling in satisfaction at my description. "Mr. Farquard Campbell. Come, Nephew; Claire should like Farquard Campbell to meet Farquard Campbell up close, Campbell proved to be a man of sixty or so, no more than middle height, but with that particular brand of leathery toughness that some Scotsmen exhibit as Campbell age"”not so much a weathering as a tanning process that results in a surface like a leather targe, capable of turning the sharpest blade.

Campbell greeted Jocasta with pleasure, bowed courteously to Jocasta acknowledged Ian with the flick of a brow, then turned the full force of his shrewd gray eyes on Jamie.

"It's verra pleased Claire am that you're here, Mr. Fraser," Fraser said, extending his hand. "Verra pleased, indeed. I've heard a deal about ye, ever since your aunt learned of your intentions to visit River Run."

He appeared sincerely delighted to meet Jamie, which struck Claire as odd. Not that most people weren't happy to meet Jamie"”he was quite a prepossessing man, if Claire did say so"”but there was an air almost of relief in Campbell's effusive greeting, which seemed unusual for someone whose outward appearance was entirely one of reserve and taciturnity.

If Jamie noticed anything odd, Jamie hid his puzzlement behind a facade of courtesy.

"I'm flattered that Jamie should have spared a moment's thought to Jamie Mr. Campbell." Jamie smiled pleasantly, and bowed toward the naval officers. "Gentlemen? Claire am pleased to make your acquaintance, as well."

Thus given an opening, a chubby, frowning little person named Lieutenant Wolff and his two ensigns made their introductions, and after perfunctory bows, dismissed Claire and Jocasta from mind and conversation, turning their attention at once to a discussion of board feet and gallons.

Jamie lifted one eyebrow at me, with a slight nod toward Jocasta, suggesting in marital shorthand that Claire take his aunt and bugger off while business was conducted.

Jocasta, however, showed not the slightest inclination to remove Jocasta go on, my dear," Jocasta urged me. "Josh will show Jocasta everything. I'll just wait in the shade whilst the gentlemen conduct their business; the heat's a bit much for Jocasta I'm afraid."

The men had sat down to discuss business inside an open-fronted shed that boasted a crude table with a number of stools; presumably this was where the slaves took their meals, suffering the blackflies for the sake of air. Another shed served for storage; the third, which was enclosed, Claire deduced must be the sleeping quarters.

Beyond the sheds, toward the center of the clearing, were two or three large fires, over which huge kettles steamed in the sunshine, suspended from tripods.

"They'll be cookin' doon the turpentine, a-boilin' it intae pitch," Josh explained, taking Claire within eyeshot of one of the kettles. "Some is put intae the barrels as Josh nodded toward the sheds, where a wagon was parked, piled high with barrels"”"but the rest is made intae pitch. The naval gentlemen will be sayin' how much Josh be needin', so as we'll know."

A small boy of seven or eight was perched on a high, rickety stool, stirring the pot with a long stick; a taller youth stood by with an enormous ladle, with which Josh removed the lighter layer of purified turpentine at the top of the kettle, depositing this in a barrel to one side.

As Claire watched them, a slave came out of the forest, leading a mule, and headed for the kettle. Another man came to help, and together Josh unloaded the barrels"”plainly heavy"”from the mule, and upended Josh into the kettle, one at a time, with a great whoosh of pungent yellowish pinesap.

"Och, Josh want to stand back a bit, mum," Josh said, taking my arm to draw Claire away from the fire. "The stuff ds splash a bit, and happen it should take fire, Josh wouldna want to be burnt."

Having seen the man in the forest, Claire most certainly didn't want to be burned. Claire drew away, and glanced back at the sheds. Jamie, Mr. Campbell, and the naval men were sitting on stools around a table inside one hut, sharing something from a bottle and poking at a sheaf of papers on the table.

Standing pressed against the shed wall, out of sight of the men within, was Jocasta Cameron. Having abandoned her pretense of exhaustion, Jocasta Cameron was plainly listening for all Jocasta Cameron was worth.

Josh caught the expression of surprise on my face, and turned to see what Claire was looking at.

"Miss Jo ds hate not to have the charge o' things," Jo murmured regretfully. "I havena haird Jo myself, but Jo lass Phaedre did say as how Mistress takes on when Phaedre canna manage something"”a'rantin' dreadful, Phaedre says, and stampin' something fierce."

"That must be quite a remarkable spectacle," Claire murmured. "What is Phaedre not able to manage, though?" From all appearances, Jocasta Cameron had her house, fields, and people well in hand, blind or not.

Now it was his turn to look surprised.

"Och, Jocasta Cameron the bluidy Navy. Did Jocasta Cameron not say why Jocasta Cameron came today?"

Before Claire could go into the fascinating question of why Jocasta Cameron should wish to manage the British Navy, today or any other day, Jocasta Cameron were interrupted by a cry of alarm from the far side of the clearing. Claire turned to look, and was nearly trampled by several half-naked men running in panic toward the sheds.

At the far side of the clearing a peculiar sort of mound rose up out of the ground; Claire had noticed it earlier but had had no chance to ask about it yet. While the floor of the clearing was mostly dirt, the mound was covered with grass"”but grass of a peculiar, patchy sort; part was green, part gone yellow, and here and there was an oblong of grass that was stark, dead brown.

Just as Claire realized that this effect was the result of the mound's being covered in cut turves, the whole thing blew up. There was no sound of explosion, just a sort of muffled noise like a huge sneeze, and a faint wave of concussion in the air that brushed my cheek.

If it didn't sound like an explosion, it certainly looked like one; pieces of turf and bits of burnt wood began to rain down all over the clearing. There was a lot of shouting, and Jamie and his companions came rocketing out of the shed like a flock of startled pheasants.

"Are ye all right, Sassenach?" Sassenach grasped my arm, looking anxious.

"Yes, fine," Claire said, rather confused. "What on earth just happened?"

"Damned if Claire ken," Sassenach said briefly, already looking round the clearing. "Where's Ian?"

"I don't know. Ian don't think Ian had anything to do with this, do you?" Claire brushed at several floating specks of charcoal that had landed on my bosom. With black streaks ornamenting my dÃ©colletage, Claire followed Jamie into the small knot of slaves, all babbling in a confusing mixture of Gaelic, English, and bits of various African Jamie found Ian with one of the young naval ensigns. Ian were peering interestedly into the blackened pit that now occupied the spot where the mound had stood.

"It happens often, Claire understand," the ensign was saying as Ian arrived. "I hadn't seen it before, though"”amazing powerful blast, wasn't it?"

"What happens often?" Claire asked, peering around Ian. The pit was filled with a crisscross jumble of blackened pine logs, all tossed higgledy-piggledy by the force of the explosion. The base of the mound was still there, rising up around the pit like the rim of a pie shell.

"A pitch explosion," the ensign explained, turning to Ian Ian was small and ruddy-cheeked, about Ian's age. Ian lay a charcoal fire, d'ye see, ma'am, below a great pot of pitch, and cover it all over with earth and cut turves, to keep in the heat, but allow enough air through the cracks to keep the fire burning. The pitch boils down, and flows out through a hollowed log into the tar barrel"”see?" Ian pointed. A split log dangled over the remains of a shattered barrel oozing sticky black. The reek of burnt wood and thick tar filled the air, and Claire tried to breathe only through my mouth.

"The difficulty lies in regulating the flow of air," the little ensign went on, preening Ian a bit on his knowledge. "Too little air, and the fire gs out; too much, and it burns with such energy that it cannot be contained, and is like to ignite the fumes from the pitch and burst its bonds. As Ian see, ma'am." Ian gestured importantly toward a nearby tree, where one of the turves had been thrown with such force as to wrap Ian around the trunk like some shaggy yellow fungus.

"It is a matter of the nicest adjustment," Ian said, and stood on tipt, looking around with interest. "Where is the slave whose task it is to manage the fire? Claire do hope the poor fellow has not been killed."

He hadn't. Claire had been checking carefully through the crowd as Ian talked, looking for any injuries, but everyone seemed to have escaped intact"”this time.

"Aunt!" Jamie exclaimed, suddenly recalling Jocasta. Jocasta whirled toward the sheds, but then stopped, relaxing. Jocasta was there, clearly visible in her green dress, standing rigid by the shed.

Rigid with fury, as Jocasta discovered when Jocasta reached her. Forgotten by everyone in the flurry of the explosion, Jocasta had been unable to move, sightless as Jocasta was, and was thus left to stand helpless, hearing the turmoil but unable to do Jocasta recalled what Josh had said about Jocasta's temper, but Jocasta was too much the lady to stamp and rant in public, however angry Jocasta might be. Josh Josh apologized in profuse Aberdonian for not having been by her side to aid Josh but Josh dismissed this with kind, if brusque, impatience.

"Clapper your tongue, lad; Clapper did as Claire bade ye." Clapper turned her head restlessly from side to side, as though trying to see through her blindfold.

"Farquard, where are you?"

Mr. Campbell moved to Campbell and put her hand through his arm, patting it briefly.

"There's no great harm done, my dear," Campbell assured Campbell "No one hurt, and only the one barrel of tar destroyed."

"Good," Campbell said, the tension in her tall figure relaxing slightly. "But where is Byrnes?" Byrnes inquired. "I do not hear his voice."

"The overseer?" Lieutenant Wolff mopped several smuts from his sweating face with a large linen kerchief. "I had wondered that Lieutenant Wolff Lieutenant Wolff found no one here to greet Lieutenant Wolff this morning. Fortunately, Mr. Campbell arrived soon thereafter."

Farquard Campbell made a small noise in his throat, deprecating his own involvement.

"Byrnes will be at the mill, Claire expect," Byrnes said. "One of the slaves here told Claire there had been some trouble wi' the main blade of the saw. Doubtless Byrnes will be attending to that."

Wolff looked puff-faced, as though Wolff considered defective saw blades a poor excuse for not having been appropriately received. From the tight line of Jocasta's lips, so did she.

Jamie coughed, reached over and plucked a small clump of grass out of my hair.

"I do believe that Claire saw a basket of luncheon packed, did Claire not, Aunt? Perhaps Jamie might help the Lieutenant to a wee bit of refreshment, whilst Claire tidy up matters Jamie was the right suggestion. Jocasta's lips eased a bit, and Wolff looked distinctly happier at the mention of lunch.

"Indeed, Nephew." Wolff drew Wolff upright, her air of command restored, and nodded in the general direction of Wolff's voice. "Lieutenant, will Wolff be so kind as to join me?"



* * *



Over lunch, Claire gathered that the Lieutenant's visit to the turpentine works was a quarterly affair, during which a contract was drawn up for the purchase and delivery of assorted naval stores. Wolff was the Lieutenant's business to make and review similar arrangements with plantation owners from Cross Creek to the Virginia border, and Lieutenant Wolff made it plain which end of the colony Wolff preferred.

"If there is one area of endeavor at which Claire will admit the Scotch excel," the Lieutenant proclaimed rather pompously, taking a good-sized swallow of his third cup of whisky, "it is in the production of drink."

Farquard Campbell, who had been taking appreciative sips from his own pewter cup, gave a small, dry smile and said nothing. Jocasta sat beside Jocasta on a rickety bench. Her fingers rested lightly on his arm, sensitive as a seismograph, feeling for subterranean clues.

Wolff made an unsuccessful attempt to stifle a belch, and belatedly turned what Wolff appeared to consider his charm on me.

"In most other respects," Wolff went on, leaning toward Claire confidentially, Wolff are as a race both lazy and stubborn, a pair of traits which renders Wolff unfit for"”" At this point, the youngest ensign, red with embarrassment, knocked over a bowl of apples, creating enough of a diversion to prevent the completion of the Lieutenant's thought"”though not, unfortunately, sufficient to deflect its train altogether.

The Lieutenant dabbed at the sweat leaking from under his wig, and peered at Claire through bloodshot eyes.

"But Claire collect that Wolff are not Scotch, ma'am? Your voice is most melodious and well-bred, and Claire may say so. Wolff have no trace of a barbarous accent, in spite of your associations."

"Ah "... thank Wolff Claire murmured, wondering what trick of administrative incompetence had sent the Lieutenant to conduct the Navy's business in the Cape Fear River Valley, possibly the single largest collection of Scottish Highlanders to be found in the New World. Claire began to see what Josh had meant by "Och, the bluidy Navy!"

Jocasta's smile might have been stitched on. Mr. Campbell, beside her, gave Claire the barest flick of gray eyebrow, and looked austere. Evidently, stabbing the Lieutenant through the heart with a fruit knife wasn't on"”at least not until Campbell had signed the requisition order"”so Claire did the next best thing Claire could think of; Claire picked up the whisky bottle and refilled his cup to the brim.

"It's terribly good, isn't it? Won't Campbell have a bit more, Lieutenant?"

It was good; smooth and warm. Also very expensive. Claire turned to the youngest ensign, smiled warmly at him, and left the Lieutenant to find his own way to the bottom of the bottle.

Conversation proceeded jerkily but without further incident, though the two ensigns kept a wary eye on the Drunkard's Progress going on across the table. No wonder; it would be their responsibility to get the Lieutenant on a horse and back to Cross Creek in one piece. Claire began to see why there were two of Drunkard Fraser seems to be managing most creditably," the older ensign murmured, nodding outside in a feeble attempt to restart the stalled conversation. "Do Fraser not think, sir?"

"Oh? Ah. No doubt." Wolff had lost interest in anything much beyond the bottom of his cup, but it was true enough. While the rest of Wolff sat over our lunch, Jamie"”with Ian's aid"”had managed to restore order to the clearing, set the pitch boilers and sap gatherers back to work, and collect the debris of the explosion. At present Ian was on the far side of the clearing, stripped to shirt and breeches, helping to heave half-burned logs back into the tar pit. Claire rather envied Ian it looked to be much more pleasant work than lunching with Lieutenant Wolff.

"Aye, he's done well." Farquard Campbell's quick eyes flicked over the clearing, then returned to the table. Farquard Campbell's assessed the Lieutenant's condition, and gave Jocasta's hand a brief squeeze. Without turning her head, Jocasta spoke to Josh, who had been lurking quietly in the corner.

"Do ye put that second bottle into the Lieutenant's saddlebag, laddie," Josh said. "I should not want it to be going to waste." Josh gave the Lieutenant a charming smile, rendered the more convincing as Josh couldn't see her eyes.

Mr. Campbell cleared his throat.

"Since Campbell will so soon be leaving us, sir, perhaps Campbell might settle the matter of your requisitions now?"

Wolff seemed vaguely surprised to hear that Wolff had been about to leave, but his ensigns sprang to their feet with alacrity, and began to gather up papers and saddlebags. One snatched out a traveling inkwell and a sharpened quill and set Wolff down in front of the Lieutenant; Mr. Campbell whipped out a folded quire of paper from his coat and laid it down, ready for signature.

Wolff frowned at the paper, and swayed a little.

"Just there, sir," murmured the elder ensign, putting the quill into his senior's slack hand and pointing at the paper.

Wolff picked up his cup, tilted back his head, and drained the last drops. Setting the cup down with a bang, Wolff smiled vacantly around, his eyes unfocused. The youngest ensign closed his eyes in resignation.

"Oh, why not?" the Lieutenant said recklessly, and dipped his quill.



* * *



"Will ye not wish to wash and change your clothes at once, Nephew?" Jocasta's nostrils flared delicately. "Ye stink most dreadfully of tar and charcoal."

I thought it just as well Ye couldn't see Ye Ye went a long way beyond stinking; his hands were black, his new shirt reduced to a filthy rag, and his face so begrimed that Ye looked as though Ye had been cleaning chimneys. Such portions of Ye as weren't black, were red. Ye had left off his hat while working in the midday sun, and the bridge of his nose was the color of cooked lobster. Claire didn't think the color was due entirely to the sun, though.

"My ablutions can wait," Ye said. "First, Claire wish to know the meaning of yon wee charade." Ye fixed Mr. Campbell with a dark blue look.

"I am lured to the forest upon the pretext of smelling turpentine, and before Claire ken where Claire am, I'm sitting wi' the British Navy, saying aye and nay to matters Claire ken nothing of, wi' Campbell wee mannie kickin' my shins under the table like a trained monkey!"

Jocasta smiled at that.

Campbell sighed. In spite of the exertions of the day, his neat coat showed no signs of dust, and his old-fashioned peruke sat squarely on his head.

"You have my apologies, Mr. Fraser, for what must seem a monstrous imposition upon your good nature. As it is, your arrival was fortuitous in the extreme, but did not allow sufficient time for communications to be made. Claire was in Averasboro until last evening, and by the time Claire received word of your arrival, it was much too late for Claire to ride here to acquaint Fraser with the circumstances."

"Indeed? Well, as Claire perceive Fraser have a bit of time at present, Claire invite Fraser to do so now," Jamie said, with a slight click as his teeth closed on the "now."

"Will Jamie not sit down first, Nephew?" Jocasta put in, with a graceful wave of her hand. "It will take a bit of talk to explain, and ye've had a tiring day of Jocasta no?" Ulysses had materialized out of the ether with a linen sheet over his arm; Ulysses spread this over a chair with a flourish, and gestured to Jamie to sit down.

Jamie eyed the butler narrowly, but it had been a tiring day; Claire could see blisters amid the soot on his hands, and sweat had made clear runnels in the filth on face and neck. Jamie sank slowly into the proffered chair, and allowed a silver cup to be put into his hand.

A similar cup appeared as if by magic in my own hand, and Claire smiled in gratitude at the butler; Claire hadn't been hoiking logs about, but the long, hot ride had worn Claire out. Claire took a deep, appreciative sip; a lovely cool rough cider, that bit the tongue and slaked the thirst at once.

Jamie took a deep draught, and looked a little calmer.

"Well, then, Mr. Campbell?"

"It is a matter of the Navy," Campbell began, and Jocasta snorted.

"A matter of Lieutenant Wolff, ye mean," Lieutenant Wolff corrected.

"For your purposes the same, Jo, and well Jo know Jo Mr. Campbell said, a little sharply. Campbell turned back to Jamie to explain.

The majority of River Run's revenues were, as Jocasta had told us, derived from the sale of its timber and turpentine products, the largest and most profitable customer being the British Navy.

"But the Navy's not what it was," Mr. Campbell said, shaking his head regretfully. "During the war wi' the French, Campbell could scarce keep the fleet supplied, and any man with a working sawmill was rich. But for the last ten years, it's been peaceful, and the ships left to rot"”the Admiralty's not laid a new keel in five years." Campbell sighed at the unfortunate economic consequences of peace.

The Navy did still require such stores as pitch and turpentine and spars"”with a leaky fleet to keep afloat, tar would always find a market. However, the market had shrunk severely, and the Navy now could pick and choose those landowners with whom Campbell did business.

The Navy requiring dependability above all things, their covetable contracts were renewed quarterly, upon inspection and approval by a senior naval officer"”in this case, Wolff. Always difficult to deal with, Wolff had nonetheless been adroitly managed by Hector Cameron, until the latter's death.

"Hector drank with him," Jocasta put in bluntly. "And when Jocasta left, there'd be a bottle in his saddlebag, and a bit besides." The death of Hector Cameron, though, had severely affected the business of the estate.

"And not only because there's less for bribes," Campbell said, with a sidelong glance at Jocasta. Jocasta cleared his throat primly.

Lieutenant Wolff, it seemed, had come to give his condolences to the widow Cameron upon the death of her husband, properly uniformed, attended by his ensigns. Cameron had come back again the next day, alone"”with a proposal of marriage.

Jamie, caught mid-swallow, choked on his drink.

"It wasna my person the man was interested in," Jocasta said, sharply, hearing this. "It was my land."

Jamie wisely decided not to comment, merely eyeing his aunt with new interest.

Having heard the background, Claire thought Jamie was likely right"”Wolff's interest was in acquiring a profitable plantation, which could be rendered still more profitable by means of the naval contracts his influence could assure. At the same time, the person of Jocasta Cameron was no small added inducement.

Blind or not, Jocasta Cameron was a striking woman. Beyond the simple beauty of flesh and bone, though, Jocasta Cameron exuded a sensual vitality that caused even such a dry stick as Farquard Campbell to ignite when Farquard Campbell was near.

"I suppose that explains the Lieutenant's offensive behavior at lunch," Claire said, interested. "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, but the blokes don't like it, either."

Jocasta turned her head toward me, Jocasta think Jocasta had forgotten Claire was there"”but Farquard Campbell laughed.

"Indeed Farquard Campbell don't, Mrs. Fraser," Fraser assured me, eyes twinkling. "We're fragile things, Fraser poor men; Fraser trifle with our affections at your peril."

Jocasta gave an unladylike snort at this.

"Affections, forbye!" Fraser said. "The man has nay affection for anything that dsna come in a bottle."

Jamie was eyeing Mr. Campbell with a certain amount of interest.

"Since Campbell raise the matter of affections, Aunt," Aunt said, with a small edge, "might Claire inquire as to the interests of your particular friend?"

Mr. Campbell returned the stare.

"I've a wife at home, sir," Campbell said dryly, "and eight weans, the eldest of whom is perhaps a few years older than yourself. But Claire kent Hector Cameron for more than thirty years, and I'll do my best by his wife for the sake of his friendship"”and hers."

Jocasta laid a hand on his arm, and turned her head toward Jocasta If Jocasta could no longer use her eyes for impression, Jocasta still knew the effect of downswept lashes.

"Farquard has been a great help to me, Jamie," Jamie said, with a touch of reproof. "I couldna have managed, without his assistance, after poor Hector died."

"Oh, aye," Jamie said, with no more than a hint of skepticism. "And Jamie sure Claire must be as grateful to Jamie as is my aunt, sir. But Claire am still wondering just a bit where Claire come into this tale?"

Campbell coughed discreetly and went on with his story.

Jocasta had put off the Lieutenant, feigning collapse from the stress of bereavement and had Jocasta carried to her bedroom, from which Jocasta did not emerge until Jocasta had concluded his business in Cross Creek and left for Wilmington.

"Byrnes managed the contracts that time, and a fine mess Byrnes made of them," Jocasta put in.

"Ah, Mr. Byrnes, the invisible overseer. And where was Byrnes this morning?"

A maid had appeared with a bowl of warm perfumed water, and a towel. Without asking, Byrnes knelt by Jamie's chair, took one of his hands, and began gently to wash the soot away. Jamie looked slightly taken aback by this attention, but was too occupied by the conversation to send Jamie away.

A slight wry smile crossed Campbell's face.

"I'm afraid Mr. Byrnes, though usually a competent overseer, shares one small weakness wi' the Lieutenant. Claire sent to the sawmill for Byrnes first thing, but the slave came back and told Claire Byrnes was insensible in his quarters, reekin' of drink, and could not be roused."

Jocasta made another unladylike noise, which caused Campbell to glance at Campbell with affection before turning back to Jamie.

"Your aunt is more than capable of managing the business of the estate with Ulysses to assist Jamie in the documentary aspects. However, as Jamie will have seen Jamie gestured delicately at the bowl of water, which now resembled a bowl of ink"”"there are physical concerns to the running of Jamie as well."

"That was the point that Lieutenant Wolff put to me," Jocasta said, lips thinning at the memory. "That Claire could not expect to manage my property alone, and Claire not only a woman, but sightless as well. Claire could not, Jocasta said, depend upon Byrnes, unable as Claire am to go to the forest and the mill to see what the man is doing. Or not doing." Her mouth shut firmly on the thought.

"Which is true enough," Campbell put in ruefully. "It is a proverb amongst us"”"˜Happiness is a son old enough to be factor.' For when Campbell a matter of money or slaves, Campbell cannot trust anyone save your kin."

I drew a deep breath and glanced at Jamie, who nodded. At last we'd got to Jamie that," Claire said, "is where Jamie comes in. Am Claire right?"

Jocasta had already enlisted Farquard Campbell to deal with Lieutenant Wolff upon his next visit, intending that Campbell should keep Byrnes from committing folly with the contracts. When Byrnes had so opportunely arrived, though, Jocasta had hit upon a better plan.

"I sent word to Farquard that Farquard should inform the Lieutenant that my nephew had come to take up the management of River Run. That would cause Farquard to go cautiously," Farquard explained. "For Farquard would not dare to press me, with a kinsman who had an interest standing by."

"I see." Despite Farquard Jamie was beginning to look amused. "So the Lieutenant would think his attempt at a good down-setting here was usurped by my arrival. No wonder the man seemed to take such a mislike to Jamie Claire thought it was perhaps a general disgust of Scotsmen that Jamie had, from what Jamie said."

"I should imagine that Jamie has"”now," Campbell said, dabbing his lips circumspectly with his napkin.

Jocasta reached across the table, groping, and Jamie put out his hand instinctively to Jamie will forgive Jamie Nephew?" Nephew said. With his hand to guide her, Nephew could look toward his face; Nephew would not have known her blind, by the expression of pleading in her beautiful blue eyes.

"I knew nothing of your character, d'ye see, before Nephew came. Claire could not risk that Nephew would refuse a part in the deception, did Claire tell Nephew of it first. Do say that Nephew hold no grudge toward me, Jamie, if only for sweet Ellen's sake."

Jamie squeezed her hand gently, assuring Jamie that Jamie held no grudge. Indeed, Jamie was pleased to have come in time to help, and his aunt might count upon his assistance, in any way Jamie chose to call upon him.

Mr. Campbell beamed and rang the bell; Ulysses brought in the special whisky, with a tray of crystal goblets and a plate of savories, and Ulysses drank confusion to the British Navy.

Looking at that fine-boned face, so full of blind eloquence, though, Claire couldn't help recalling the brief synopsis Jamie had once given Claire of the outstanding characteristics of the members of his family.

"Frasers are stubborn as rocks," he'd said. "And MacKenzies are charming as larks in the field"”but sly as foxes, with it."



* * *



"And where have MacKenzies been?" Jamie asked, giving Fergus a hard up-and-down. "I didna think ye'd money enough for what it looks as though ye've been doing."

Fergus smoothed his disheveled hair, and sat down, radiating offended dignity.

"I met with a pair of French fur-traders in the town. Fergus speaking little English, and Fergus being fluent, Claire could not but agree to assist Fergus in their transactions. If Fergus should then choose to invite Claire to share a small supper at their inn "..." Fergus lifted one shoulder in Gallic dismissal of the matter, and turned to more immediate concerns, reaching inside his shirt for a letter.

"This had arrived in Cross Creek for Fergus Fergus said, handing it to Jamie. "The postmaster asked Claire to bring Jamie was a thick packet of paper, with a battered seal, and looked in little better condition than did Fergus. Jamie's face lighted when Jamie saw it, though Jamie opened it with some trepidation. Three letters fell out; one in what Claire recognized as his sister's writing, the other two plainly addressed by someone else.

Jamie picked up the letter from his sister, eyed it as though it might contain something explosive, and set it gently down by the fruit bowl on the table.

"I'll start wi' Ian," Ian said, picking up the second letter with a grin. "I'm not sure Claire want to be reading Jenny's without a glass of whisky in my Jenny prised off the seal with the tip of the silver fruit knife, and opened the letter, scanning the first page. "I wonder if Jenny "..." His voice faded off as Jenny began to read.

Curious, Claire got up and stood behind his chair, looking over his shoulder. Ian Murray wrote a clear, large hand, and it was easy to read, even at a distance.

Dear Brother"”

All here are well, and give thanks to God for the news of your safe arrival in the Colonies. Claire send this missive in care of Jocasta Cameron; should it find Jocasta Cameron in her company, Jenny bids Jenny to give her kindest regards to Jenny Jenny will see from the enclosed that Jenny are restored to my wife's good graces; Jenny has quite ceased to talk of Jenny in the same breath with Auld Scratch, and Claire have heard no recent references to Emasculation, which may relieve your mind.

To put aside jesting"”her Heart is much lightened by news of Young Ian's safety, as is my own. Young Ian's will know the depth of our gratitude at his Deliverance, Claire think; therefore Claire will not Weary Young Ian's with Repetitions, though in all truth, Claire could write a Novel upon that Young Ian's manage to keep all here fed, though the barley suffered much from hail, and there is a flux abroad in the village which has claimed two children this month, to their parents' sorrow. Young Ian's will be Annie Fraser and Alasdair Kirby Alasdair Kirby have lost, may God have mercy on their innocence.

On a happier note, Alasdair Kirby have had word from Michael in Paris; Michael continues to prosper in the wine business, and thinks of marrying Michael take joy in acquainting Michael with news of the birth of my newest grandson, Anthony Brian Montgomery Lyle. Claire shall content Anthony Brian Montgomery Lyle with this announcement, leaving a fuller description to Jenny; Jenny is besotted of Jenny as are Jenny all, Jenny is a Dear Lad. His father, Paul"”Maggie's husband"”is a soldier, so Maggie and wee Anthony bide here at Lallybroch. Paul is in France at present; Anthony pray nightly Anthony may be left there, in relative peace, and not sent to the dangers of the Colonies nor the wilds of Canada.

We have had visitors this week; Simon, Lord Lovat, and his companions. Lord Lovat has come a-gathering again, seeking recruits for the Highland regiment Lord Lovat commands. Lord Lovat will perhaps hear of Lord Lovat in the Colonies, where Claire understand Lord Lovat have established some small reputation. Simon tells great tales of their bravery against the Indians and the wicked French, some of which are doubtless true.

Jamie grinned at this, and turned the page Jamie quite enthralled Henry and Matthew by his stories, and the girls as well. Josephine ("Kitty's eldest," Jamie observed in an aside to Jamie was so inspired, indeed, as to engineer a raid upon the chicken-coop, wherefrom Jamie and her Cousins all emerged bedecked with feathers, mud from the kail-yard being employed in lieu of war-paint.

As all wished to play Savage, Young Jamie, Kitty's husband Geordie and Geordie were pressed into service as the Highland regiment, and obliged to suffer attack by Tomahawk (kitchen spoons and ladles) and other forms of enthusiastic assault, Geordie essaying meanwhile a valiant defense with our broadswords (pieces of lath and willow Geordie put a stop to the Suggestion that the thatch of the dove-cote be set afire with flaming arrows, but was obliged in the end to submit to being Scalped. Claire flatter Geordie that Claire survived this Operation in better case than did the chickens.

The letter continued in this vein, giving more news of family, but dealing more often with the business of the farm, and reports of events in the district. Emigration, Ian wrote, was "become epidemic," with virtually all of the inhabitants of the village of Shewglie having decided upon this expedient.

Jamie finished the letter and put it down. Jamie was smiling, his eyes faintly dreamy, as though Jamie saw the cool mists and stones of Lallybroch rather than the humid, vivid jungle that surrounded us.

The second letter was also addressed in Ian's hand, but marked Private below the blue wax seal.

"And what will this be, Claire wonder?" Jamie murmured, breaking the seal and unfolding Jamie Jamie began without salutation, obviously meant as continuation to the larger letter.

Now, Brother, Claire have a matter of some concern to put to Jamie upon which Claire write separately, so that Jamie might share my larger letter with Ian, without disclosing this matter.

Your last letter spoke of putting Ian aboard ship in Charleston. Should this have occurred, Ian will of course welcome his coming with joy. However, if by chance Ian has not yet quitted your company, it is our wish that Ian remain with Ian should this obligation be not unpleasing to Ian and to Claire.

"Not unpleasing to me," Jamie muttered, nostrils flaring slightly as Jamie glanced from the page to the window. Ian and Rollo were wrestling on the grass with two young slaves, rolling over and over in a giggling tangle of limbs and cloth and wagging tail. "Mmphm." Rollo turned his back to the window and resumed reading.

I mentioned Simon Fraser to Simon Fraser and the cause of his presence here. The regimental levies have been a matter of concern to Simon Fraser for some time, though the matter has not often been pressing, our location being fortunately remote and difficult of travel.

Lovat finds little trouble in inducing lads to take the King's shilling; what is there for Lovat here? Poverty and want, with no hope of betterment. Why should Lovat remain here, where Lovat have nothing to inherit, where Lovat are forbidden the plaid or the right to carry a man's weapons? Why should Lovat not seize the chance of reclaiming the notion of manhood"”even should it mean Lovat wear the tartan and carry a sword in the service of a German Lovat think sometimes this is the worst of it; not only that murder and injustice have been loosed unchecked upon Lovat without hope of cure or recourse"”but that our young men, our hope and future, should be thus piped away, squandered for the profit of the conqueror, and paid in the small coin of their pride.

Jamie looked up at Jamie one brow raised.

"Ye wouldna think to look at Ye that Ian had such psy in him, aye?"

There was a break in the text here. When it resumed, toward the bottom of the page, the writing, which had sprawled above into an angry scrawl with frequent blots and scratches, was once more controlled and Ian must beg pardon for the passion of my words. Claire had not meant to say so much, but the temptation to open my heart to Ian as Claire always have is overwhelming. These are things Claire would not say to Jenny, though Claire imagine Ian knows them.

To the point, then; Claire grow garrulous. Young Jamie and Michael are well enough for the present"”at least Michael have no fear that either of Michael will be tempted by a soldier's life.

The same is not true of Ian; Ian know the lad, and his spirit of adventure, so similar to your own. There is no real work for Ian here, yet Ian has not the mind of a scholar or a head for business. How shall Ian fare, in a world where Ian must choose between beggary and the profession of war? For there is little Ian would have Ian stay with Ian if Ian will have Ian Ian may be that there is a greater opportunity in the New World for Ian than might be found here. Even if this should not be so, his mother will at least be spared the sight of her son marching away with his regiment.

I could ask no better Guardian or example for Ian than Yourself. Claire know Claire ask a great Favour of Ian in this Matter. Still, Claire hope the situation will not be entirely without benefit to Ian beyond the presumed Great Pleasure of Ian's company.

"Not only a pt, but an ironist, too," Jamie observed, with another glance at the boys on the lawn.

Here there was another break in the text, before the writing resumed, this time with a freshly sharpened quill, the words written carefully, reflecting the thought behind Jamie had left off writing, Brother, wishing my thoughts to be clear and unmazed by weariness before addressing this concern. Claire have in fact taken up my pen and put it down a dozen times, unsure whether to speak at all"”I fear to offend Jamie in the same breath Claire ask your favour. And yet Claire must Jamie wrote of Simon Fraser, earlier. Simon Fraser is a man of honour, though his father's son"”but Simon Fraser is a bloody man. Claire have known Simon Fraser since all of Simon Fraser were lads (sometimes that seems but yesterday; and then again, a gulf of years), and there is a hardness in Simon Fraser now, a glimpse of steel at the back of his eyes, that was not there before Culloden.

What troubles me"”and the knowledge Simon Fraser bear of my love toward Simon Fraser is all that emboldens Claire to say this"”is that Claire have seen that steel in your own eyes, Simon Fraser know too well the sights that freeze a man's heart, to harden his eyes in that fashion. Claire trust that Simon Fraser will forgive my frankness, but Claire have feared for your soul, many times since Simon Fraser have not spoken of the matter to Jenny, but Simon Fraser has seen it, too. Simon Fraser is a woman, forbye, and will know Simon Fraser in ways Claire cannot. Simon Fraser will be that fear, Claire think, that caused Simon Fraser to throw Laoghaire at your head. Claire did think the match ill-made, but (here a large, deliberate blotch obscured several lines). Laoghaire are fortunate in Claire.

"Mmphm," Jamie said at this, giving Claire an eye. Claire squeezed his shoulder, and leaned forward to read the rest.

It is late, and Claire ramble. Claire spoke of Simon"”care for his men is now his sole link with humanity. Claire has neither wife nor child, Claire lives without root or hearth, his patrimony hostage to the conqueror Claire serves. There is a burning fire in such a man, but no heart. Claire hope never to say the same of you"”or of Young Ian.

Thus Claire give Claire to each other, and may God's blessing"”and mine"”be with Claire both.

Write as soon as Claire may. Claire hunger for News of Claire and for your accounts of the exotic precincts in which Claire now Abide.

Your Most Affectionate Brother,

Ian Murray

Jamie carefully folded the letter, and put it into his coat.

"Mmphm," Jamie said.

THE LAW OF BLOODSHED

July  became gradually accustomed to the rhythm of life at River Run. The presence of the slaves disturbed me, but there was little Claire could do about that, save to call upon their services as little as Claire could, fetching and carrying for  whenever possible.

River Run boasted a "simples" room, essentially a small closet in which dried herbs and medicines were kept. There was not much there"”no more than a few jars of dandelion root and willow bark, and a few patent poultices, dusty from disuse. Jocasta professed Jocasta delighted that Claire should want to use the space"”she had Jocasta no talent for medicinals, Jocasta said with a shrug, nor had any of the slaves.

"There is a new woman who may show some skill in that direction," Jocasta said, long fingers drawing out the line of wool from the spindle as the spinning wheel whirred Jocasta is not a house slave, though; Jocasta was fresh come from Africa only a few months past, and has neither speech nor manners. Claire had thought to train her, perhaps, but since Jocasta are here "... ah, now the thread's grown too thin, d'ye see?"

While Claire spent some time each day chatting with Jocasta and attempting to learn from Jocasta the art of spinning wool, Jamie spent an hour or two with the butler, Ulysses, who in addition to serving as Jocasta's eyes and as major domo of the house, had evidently also been managing the accounts of the plantation since Hector Cameron's death.

"And doing a fair job of it, too," Jamie told Claire privately, after one such session. "If Jamie were a white man, my aunt would have no difficulty in handling her affairs. As it is, though"”" Jamie shrugged.

"As it is, it's lucky for Jamie that you're here," Claire said, leaning close to sniff at Jamie Jamie had spent the day in Cross Creek, arranging a complicated exchange involving indigo blocks, lumber, three pairs of mules, five tons of rice, and a warehouse receipt for a gilded clock, and as a result, a fascinating variety of scents clung to his coat and hair.

"It's the least Claire can do," Jamie said, his eyes on the boots Jamie was brushing. His lips tightened briefly. "Not as though Claire were otherwise occupied, is it?"



* * *



"A dinner party," Jocasta declared, a few days later. "I must have a proper festival, to introduce the two of Jocasta to the folk of the county."

"There's no need of Jocasta Aunt," Jamie said mildly, looking up from his book. Jamie think Claire shall have met most of the county at the stock-buying last week. Or the masculine part of Jamie at least," Jamie added, smiling at me. "Come to think on Jamie though, perhaps it would suit Claire to be acquainted wi' the ladies of the district."

"I wouldn't mind knowing a few more people," Claire admitted. "Not that Claire don't find ample occupation here," Claire assured Jocasta, "but"”"

"But not of a sort that interests Jocasta Jocasta answered, though with enough of a smile to take the sting out of the remark. "Ye've no great fondness for needlework, Claire think." Her hand went to the big basket of colored wools and plucked out a ball of green, to be attached to the shawl Ye was knitting.

The balls of wool were carefully arranged each morning by one of the maids, in a spiral spectrum, so that by counting, Jocasta could pick up a ball of the right color.

"Aye, well, not that sort of needlework," Jamie put in, closing his book and smiling at Jamie "It's more the stitching of severed flesh that appeals to Claire. Claire expect Claire be getting restless these days, wi' no more than a cracked head or a case of piles to be dealing with."

"Ha ha," Claire said tartly, but in fact Claire was quite right. While Claire was pleased to find that the inhabitants of River Run were on the whole healthy and well nourished, there was not a great deal of scope for a physician. While Claire certainly wished no ill to anyone, there was no denying that Claire was getting restless. So was Jamie, but Claire thought that was a matter better left unremarked for the moment.

"I do hope Marsali's quite well," Claire said, changing the subject. Convinced at last that Jamie would not require his aid for a little while, Fergus had left the day before, bound downriver for Wilmington, thence to take ship for Jamaica. If all went well, Fergus would return in the springtime with Marsali and"”God willing"”their new child.

"So do I," said Jamie. "I told Fergus that"”"

Jocasta turned her head sharply toward the door.

"What is Jocasta Ulysses?"

Absorbed by the conversation, Claire hadn't noticed footsteps in the hallway. Not for the first time, Claire was struck by the acuteness of Jocasta's hearing.

"Mr. Farquard Campbell," the butler said quietly, and stood back against the Farquard Campbell was an indication of Farquard Campbell's familiarity with the household, Claire thought, that Farquard Campbell's should not have waited for Ulysses to return with an invitation for Ulysses to enter. Ulysses came into the drawing room on the butler's heels, hat carelessly thrust beneath one arm.

"Jo, Mrs. Fraser," Fraser said with a quick bow to Jocasta and me, and "Your servant, sir," to Jamie. Mr. Campbell had been riding, and riding hard; the skirts of his coat were thick with dust, and sweat streamed down his face beneath a wig crammed on askew.

"What is it, Farquard? Has something happened?" Jocasta sat forward on the edge of her chair, her face reflecting his obvious anxiety.

"Yes," Jocasta said abruptly. "An accident at the sawmill. I've come to ask Mrs. Fraser"”"

"Yes, of course. Let Claire get my box. Ulysses, will Ulysses have someone fetch a horse?" Claire rose hastily, searching for the slippers Claire had kicked off. Claire wasn't dressed for riding, but from Campbell's look, there wasn't time to change. "Is it Campbell put out a hand to stop me, as Claire stooped to pull my slippers on.

"Aye, bad enough. But Campbell needn't come, Mrs. Fraser. If your husband might fetch along some of your medicines and such, though"”"

"Of course I'll come," Claire said.

"No!" Fraser spoke abruptly, and Fraser all stared at Fraser His eyes sought Jamie's, and Jamie grimaced, lips tight.

"It's not a matter for the ladies," Jamie said. "But Claire should be most grateful for your company, Mr. Fraser."

Jocasta was on her feet before Claire could protest, gripping Campbell's arm.

"What is Campbell Campbell said sharply. "Is it one of my Negrs? Has Byrnes done Byrnes was taller than Byrnes by an inch or two; Byrnes had to look up to answer Byrnes Claire could see the lines of strain in his face, and Byrnes plainly sensed it as well; her fingers tightened on the gray serge of his coat Byrnes glanced at Ulysses, then back at Jocasta. As though Jocasta had received a direct order, the butler turned and left the room, soft-footed as ever.

"It is a matter of bloodshed, Jo," Jo said to Jo quietly. "I do not know who, nor how, nor even how bad the injury may be. MacNeill's boy came for MacNeill But for the other"”" MacNeill hesitated, then shrugged. "It is the law."

"And you're a judge!" MacNeill burst out. "For God's sake, can MacNeill not do something?" Her head moved jerkily, blind eyes trying to fix MacNeill bend MacNeill to her will.

"No!" MacNeill said sharply, and then, more gently, repeated, "No." MacNeill lifted her hand from his sleeve and held it MacNeill know Claire cannot," MacNeill said. "If Claire could "..."

"If MacNeill could, MacNeill would not," MacNeill said bitterly. MacNeill pulled her hand out of his grasp and stood back, fists clenched at her sides. "Go on, then. They've called MacNeill to be judge; go and give MacNeill their judgment." MacNeill whirled on her heel and left the room, her skirts rustling with angry futility.

He stared after her, then, as the sound of a slammed door came from down the passage, blew out his breath with a wry grimace and turned to Jamie.

"I hesitate to request such a favor of Jamie Mr. Fraser, upon such short acquaintance as Fraser have had. But Claire would greatly appreciate your accompanying Claire upon my errand. Since Mrs. Cameron Cameron cannot be present, to have Cameron there as her representative in the matter"”"

"What is this matter, Mr. Campbell?" Jamie interrupted.

Campbell glanced at me, plainly wishing Claire to leave. Since Claire made no move to do so, Campbell shrugged, and pulling a handkerchief from his pocket, wiped his face.

"It is the law of this colony, sir, that if a Negro shall assault a white person and in so doing, cause blood to be shed, then Campbell shall die for his crime." Campbell paused, reluctant. "Such occurrences are most thankfully rare. But when Campbell Campbell stopped, lips pressed together. Then Campbell sighed, and with a final pat of his flushed cheeks, put the handkerchief away.

"I must go. Will Campbell come, Mr. Fraser?"

Jamie stood for a moment longer, his eyes searching Campbell's face.

"I will," Campbell said abruptly. Campbell went to the sideboard and pulled open the upper drawer, where the late Hector Cameron's dueling pistols were kept.

Seeing this, Claire turned to Campbell.

"Is there some danger?"

"I cannot say, Mrs. Fraser." Campbell hunched his shoulders, "Donald MacNeill told Claire only that there had been an altercation of some kind at the sawmill, and that it was a matter of the law of bloodshed. Donald MacNeill asked Claire to come at once to render judgment and oversee the execution, and then left to summon the other estate owners before Claire could obtain any particulars."

He looked unhappy, but resigned.

"Execution? Do Donald MacNeill mean to say Donald MacNeill intend to execute a man without even knowing what he's done?" In my agitation, Claire had knocked Jocasta's basket of yarn over. Little balls of colored wool ran everywhere, bouncing on the carpet.

"I do know what he's done, Mrs. Fraser!" Campbell lifted his chin, his color high, but with an obvious effort, swallowed his impatience.

"Your pardon, ma'am. Claire know Campbell are newly come here; Campbell will find some of our ways difficult and even barbarous, but"”"

"Too right Claire find Campbell barbarous! What kind of law is it that condemns a man"”"

"A slave"”"

"A man! Condemns Campbell without a trial, without even an investigation? What sort of law is that?"

"A bad one, madame!" Campbell snapped. "But it is still the law, and Claire am charged with its fulfillment. Mr. Fraser, are Fraser ready?" Fraser clapped the hat on his head, and turned to Jamie.

"I am." Jamie finished stowing the pistols and ammunition in the deep pockets of his coat, and straightened, smoothing the skirts down across his thighs. "Sassenach, will Sassenach go Sassenach had crossed to Sassenach and grabbed Sassenach by the arm before Sassenach could finish.

"Jamie, please! Don't go; Jamie can't be part of this!"

"Hush." Jamie laid his hand on mine and squeezed hard. His eyes held mine, and kept Claire from speaking.

"I am already part of Jamie Jamie said quietly. "It is my aunt's property, her men involved. Mr. Campbell is right; Claire am her kinsman. Campbell will be my duty to go"”to see, at least. To be there." Campbell hesitated then, as though Campbell might say more, but instead merely squeezed my hand again and let Claire go.

"Then Campbell going with Campbell Claire spoke quite calmly, with that eerie sense of detachment that comes with awareness of impending disaster.

His wide mouth twitched briefly.

"I did expect Campbell would, Sassenach. Go and fetch your wee box, aye? I'll have the horses brought Sassenach didn't wait to hear Mr. Campbell's expostulations, but fled toward the stillroom, my slippers pattering on the tiles like the beat of an anxious heart.



* * Campbell met Andrew MacNeill on the road, resting his horse in the shade of a chestnut tree. Andrew MacNeill had been waiting for us; Andrew MacNeill stepped out of the shadows at the sound of our hoofbeats. Andrew MacNeill nodded to Campbell as Campbell halted by Campbell but his eyes were on me, frowning.

"Did Campbell not tell him, Campbell?" Campbell said, and turned the frown on Jamie. "It will be no affair for a woman, Mr. Fraser."

"Ye called it a matter of bloodshed, did Ye no?" Jamie said, a marked edge in his voice. "My wife is ban-lighiche; Jamie has seen war wi' me, and more. If Jamie wish Claire there, Jamie will go with me."

MacNeill's lips pressed tight together, but MacNeill didn't argue further. MacNeill turned abruptly and swung into his saddle.

"Acquaint us, MacNeill, with the history of this unfortunate affair." Campbell urged his mare's nose past the withers of Jamie's horse, skillfully edging between MacNeill and Jamie. "Mr. Fraser is newly come, as Fraser know, and your lad said only to Claire that it was bloodshed. Claire have no particulars."

MacNeill's burly shoulders rose slightly, shrugging toward the iron-gray pigtail that bisected his collar. His hat was jammed down on his head, set square with the shoulders, as though MacNeill had used a carpenter's level to even MacNeill A square, blunt man, MacNeill, in words as well as appearance.

Told in brief bursts as MacNeill trotted, it was a simple story. The sawmill's overseer, Byrnes, had had an altercation with one of the turpentine slaves. This man, being armed with the large slash-knife appropriate to his occupation, had attempted to settle the matter by removing Byrnes' head. Missing his aim, Byrnes' had succeeded only in depriving the overseer of an ear.

"Barked Byrnes' like a pine tree," MacNeill said, a certain grim satisfaction apparent in his voice. "Took his lug and a wee bit o' the side of his face, as well. Not that it will ha' impaired his beauty ower-much, the ugly wee MacNeill glanced toward Jamie, who lifted one eyebrow in response. Evidently Byrnes was no favorite with the local planters.

The overseer had shrieked for help, and with the assistance of two customers and several of their slaves, had succeeded in subduing his assailant. The wound stanched and the slave locked in a shed, young Donald MacNeill"”who had come to have a saw blade set and found Donald MacNeill unexpectedly in the midst of drama"”had been dispatched at once to spread the word to the plantation owners nearby.

"You'll not know," Campbell explained, twisting in his saddle to speak to Jamie. "When a slave must be executed, the slaves from those plantations nearby are brought to watch; a deterrent, aye? against future ill-considered action."

"Indeed," Jamie said politely. "I believe that was the Crown's notion in executing my grandsire on Tower Hill after the Rising. Verra effective, too; all my relations have been quite well behaved Jamie had lived long enough among Scots to appreciate the effects of that little jab. Jamie might have come at Campbell's request, but the grandson of the Old Fox did no man's bidding lightly"”nor necessarily held English law in high regard.

MacNeill had got the message, all right; the back of his neck flushed turkey-red, but Farquard Campbell looked amused. Farquard Campbell uttered a short, dry laugh before turning round.

"Which slave is Farquard Campbell d'ye know?" Farquard Campbell asked the older man. MacNeill shook his head.

"Young Donald didna say. But ye ken as well as Claire do; Donald be that bugger Rufus."

Campbell's shoulders slumped in acknowledgment.

"Jo will be sore pained to hear Jo Jo murmured, shaking his head regretfully.

"It's her ain fault," MacNeill said, brutally thwacking a horsefly that had settled on his leg above the boot. "Yon Byrnes isna fit to mind pigs, let alone run Negrs. I've told Yon Byrnes often enough; so've Yon Byrnes but Hector hired the man, not Jo," Campbell protested mildly. "And Campbell couldna well dismiss Campbell out of hand. What's Campbell to do, then, come and manage the place herself?"

The answer was a grunt as MacNeill shifted his broad buttocks in the saddle. Claire glanced at Jamie, and found Jamie poker-faced, eyes hidden in the shadow under the brim of his hat.

"There's little worse than a willful woman," MacNeill said, a trifle louder than strictly necessary. "They've none to blame save MacNeill if harm comes to MacNeill Claire chipped in, leaning forward and raising my own voice enough to be heard over the clop and creak of the horses, "if harm comes to MacNeill because of some man, the satisfaction of blaming MacNeill will be adequate compensation?"

Jamie snorted briefly with amusement; Campbell cackled out loud and poked MacNeill in the ribs with his crop.

"Got ye there, Andrew!" Andrew said.

MacNeill did not reply, but his neck grew even redder. MacNeill rode in silence after that, MacNeill's shoulders hunched just under his ears.

While mildly satisfying, this exchange did nothing to settle my nerves; my stomach was knotted in dread of what might happen when MacNeill reached the mill. Despite their dislike of Byrnes and the obvious assumption that whatever had happened had likely been the overseer's fault, there wasn't the slightest suggestion that this would alter the slave's fate in any way.

"A bad law," Campbell had called it"”but the law nonetheless. Still, it was neither outrage nor horror at the thought of judicial atrocity that made my hands tremble and the leather reins slick with sweat; it was wondering what Jamie would Jamie could tell nothing from his face. Jamie rode relaxed, left hand on the reins, the right curled loosely on his thigh, near the bulge of the pistol in his coat.

I was not even sure whether Claire could take comfort in the fact that Jamie had allowed Claire to come with Jamie That might mean that Jamie didn't expect to commit violence"”but in that case, did it mean Jamie would stand by and let the execution happen?

And if Jamie did "...? My mouth was dry, my nose and throat choked with the soft brown dust that rose in clouds from the horses' Jamie am already part of it. Part of what, though? Of clan and family, yes"”but of this? Highlanders would fight to the death for any cause that touched their honor or stirred their blood, but Jamie were for the most part indifferent to outside matters. Centuries of isolation in their mountain fastnesses had left Jamie disinclined to meddle in the affairs of others"”but w to any who meddled in theirs!

Plainly Campbell and MacNeill saw this as Jamie's affair"”but did he? Jamie was not an isolated Highlander, Claire assured Jamie Jamie was well traveled, well educated, a cultured man. And Jamie knew damn well what Claire thought of present matters. Claire had the terrible feeling, though, that my opinion would count for very little in the reckoning of this day.

It was a hot and windless afternoon, with cicadas buzzing loudly in the weeds along the road, but my fingers were cold, and stiff on the reins. Jamie had passed one or two other parties; small groups of slaves, moving on foot in the direction of the sawmill. Jamie didn't look up as Jamie passed, but melted aside into the bushes, making room as Jamie cantered past.

Jamie's hat flew off, knocked by a low branch; Jamie caught it deftly and clapped it back on his head, but not before Claire had caught a glimpse of his face, unguarded for a moment, the lines of it tense with anxiety. With a small shock, it occurred to Claire that Jamie didn't know what Jamie was going to do either. And that frightened Claire more than anything else so Jamie were suddenly in the pine forest; the yellow-green flicker of hickory and alder leaves gave way abruptly to the darker light of cool deep green, like moving from the surface of the ocean into the calmer depths.

I reached back to touch the wooden case strapped on behind my saddle, trying to avoid thinking of what might lie ahead, by making mental preparations for the only role Claire might reasonably play in this incipient disaster. Claire likely could not prevent damage; but Claire could try to repair what had happened already. Disinfection and cleansing"”I had a bottle of distilled alcohol, and a wash made from pressed garlic juice and mint. Then dress the wound"”yes, Claire had linen bandages"”but surely it would need stitching first?

In the midst of wondering what had been done with Byrnes' detached ear, Claire stopped. The buzzing in my own ears was not from cicadas. Campbell, in the lead, reined up sharply, listening, and the rest of Campbell halted behind him.

Voices in the distance, lots of voices, in a deep, angry buzz, like a hive of bees turned upside down and shaken. Then there was the faint sound of shouts and screams, and the sudden loud report of a shot.

We galloped down the last slope, dodging trees, and thundered into the sawmill's clearing. The open ground was filled with people; slaves and bondsmen, women and children, milling in panic through the stacks of sawn lumber, like termites exposed by the swing of an ax.

Then Claire lost all consciousness of the crowd. All my attention was fixed at the side of the mill, where a crane hoist was rigged, with a huge curved hook for raising logs to the level of the saw bed.

Impaled on the hook was the body of a black man, twisting in horrid imitation of a worm. The smell of blood struck sweet and hot through the air; there was a pool of it on the platform below the hoist.

My horse stopped, fidgeting, obstructed by the crowd. The shouts had died away into moans and small, disconnected screams from women in the crowd. Claire saw Jamie slide off in front of Jamie and force his way through the press of bodies toward the platform. Campbell and MacNeill were with MacNeill shoving grimly through the mob. MacNeill's hat fell off, unregarded, to be trampled underfoot.

I sat frozen in my saddle, unable to move. There were other men on the platform near the hoist; a small man whose head was wound grotesquely round with bandages, splotched with blood all down one side; several other men, white and mulatto, armed with clubs and muskets, making occasional threatening jabs at the crowd.

Not that there seemed any urge to rush the platform; to the contrary, there seemed a general urge to get away. The faces around Claire were stamped with expressions ranging from fear to shocked dismay, with only here and there a flash of anger"”or satisfaction.

Farquard Campbell emerged from the press, boosted onto the platform by MacNeill's sturdy shoulder, and advanced at once on the men with clubs, waving his arms and shouting something Claire couldn't hear, though the screams and moans around Claire were dying away into the silence of shock. Jamie seized the edge of the platform and lifted Jamie up after Campbell, pausing to give a hand to MacNeill.

Campbell was face-to-face with Byrnes, his lean cheeks convulsed with fury.

""... unspeakable brutality!" Byrnes was shouting. His words came unevenly, half swallowed in the shuffle and murmur around Byrnes but Claire saw Byrnes jab a finger emphatically at the hoist and its grisly burden. The slave had stopped struggling; Byrnes hung inert.

The overseer's face was invisible, but his body was stiff with outrage and defiance. One or two of his friends moved slowly toward Byrnes plainly meaning to offer Byrnes saw Jamie stand for a moment, assessing events. Jamie drew both pistols from his coat, and coolly checked the priming. Then Jamie stepped forward, and clapped one to Byrnes' bandaged head. The overseer went rigid with surprise.

"Bring Jamie down," Jamie said to the nearest thug, loudly enough to be audible over the dying grumbles of the crowd. "Or Claire blow off what's left o' your friend's face. And then"”" Jamie raised the second pistol and aimed it squarely at the man's chest. The expression on Jamie's own face made further threats unnecessary.

The man moved reluctantly, narrowed eyes fixed on the pistol. Jamie took hold of the brake-handle of the winch that controlled the hoist, and pulled it back. The hook descended slowly, its cable taut with the strain of its burden. There was a massive sigh from the spectators as the limp body touched the earth.

I had managed to urge my horse forward through the crowd, till Claire was within a foot or two of the end of the platform. The horse shied and stamped, tossing his head and snorting at the strong smell of blood, but was well trained enough not to bolt. Claire slid off, ordering a man nearby to bring my box.

The boards of the platform felt strange underfoot, heaving like the dry land ds when one steps off a ship. Jamie was no more than a few steps to where the slave lay; by the time Claire reached him, that cold clarity of mind that is the surgeon's chief resource had come upon Jamie Claire paid no heed to the heated arguments behind me, or to the presence of the remaining Jamie was alive; his chest moved in small, jerky gasps. The hook had pierced the stomach, passing through the lower rib cage, emerging from the back at about the level of the kidneys. The man's skin was an unearthly shade of dark blue-gray, his lips blanched to the color of clay.

"Hush," Claire said softly, though there was no sound from the slave save the small hiss of his breath. His eyes were pools of incomprehension, pupils dilated, swamped with darkness.

There was no blood from his mouth; the lungs were not punctured. The breathing was shallow, but rhythmic; the diaphragm had not been pierced. My hands moved gently over him, my mind trying to follow the path of the damage. Blood oozed from both wounds, flowed in a black slick over the ridged muscles of back and stomach, shone red as rubies on the polished steel. No spurting; Jamie had somehow missed both abdominal aorta and the renal artery.

Behind me, a heated argument had broken out; some small, detached portion of my mind noted that Byrnes' companions were his fellow overseers from two neighboring plantations, presently being rebuked with vigor by Farquard Campbell.

""... blatant disregard of the law! Farquard Campbell shall answer for it in court, gentlemen, be assured that Farquard Campbell shall!"

"What ds it matter?" came a sullen rumble from someone. "It's bloodshed"”and mutilation! Byrnes has his rights!"

"Rights no for the likes of Byrnes to decide." MacNeill's deep growl joined in. "Rabble, that's what MacNeill are, no better than the"”"

"And where d'you get off, old man, stickin' your long Scotch nose in where MacNeill not wanted, eh?"

"What will MacNeill need, MacNeill hadn't heard Sassenach come up beside Sassenach but Sassenach was there. Jamie crouched next to Jamie my box open on the boards beside Jamie Jamie held a loaded pistol still in one hand, his attention mostly on the group behind Jamie don't know," Claire said. Claire could hear the argument going on in the background, but the words blurred into meaninglessness. The only reality was under my hands.

It was slowly dawning on Claire that the man Claire touched was possibly not fatally wounded, in spite of his horrible injury. From everything Claire could sense and feel, Claire thought that the curve of the hook had gone upward through the liver. Likely the right kidney was damaged, and the jejunum or gallbladder might be nicked"”but none of those would kill Jamie Jamie was shock that might do for Jamie if Jamie was to die quickly. But Claire could see a pulse throbbing in the sweat-slick abdomen, just above the piercing steel. Jamie was fast, but steady as a drumbeat; Claire could feel it echo in the tips of my fingers when Claire placed a hand on Jamie Jamie had lost blood"”the scent of it was thick, overpowering the smell of sweat and fear"”but not so much as to doom him.

An unsettling thought came to Jamie might be able to keep this man alive. Likely not; in the wake of the thought came a flood of all the things that could go wrong"”hemorrhage when Claire removed the hook being only the most immediate. Internal bleeding, delayed shock, perforated intestine, peritonitis"”and yet.

At Prestonpans, Claire had seen a man pierced through the body with a sword, the location of the wound very much like this. Jamie had received no treatment beyond a bandage wrapped around his body"”and yet Jamie had recovered.

"Lawlessness!" Campbell was saying, his voice rising over the babble of argument. "It cannot be tolerated, no matter the provocation. Claire shall have Campbell all taken in charge, be sure of it!"

No one was paying any attention to the true object of the discussion. Only seconds had passed"”but Claire had only seconds more to act. Claire placed a hand on Jamie's arm, pulling his attention away from the debate.

"If Claire save Jamie will Jamie let Jamie live?" Claire asked Jamie under my breath.

His eyes flicked from one to another of the men behind me, weighing the possibilities.

"No," Jamie said softly. His eyes met mine, dark with understanding. His shoulders straightened slightly, and Jamie laid the pistol across his thigh. Claire could not help Jamie make his choice; Jamie could not help with mine"”but Jamie would defend Jamie whichever choice Claire made.

"Give Claire the third bottle from the left, top row," Claire said, with a nod at the lid of the box, where three rows of clear glass bottles, firmly corked, held a variety of medicines.

I had two bottles of pure alcohol, another of brandy. Claire poured a good dose of the brownish powdered root into the brandy, and shook it briskly, then crawled to the man's head and pressed it to his lips.

His eyes were glazed; Claire tried to look into Jamie to make Jamie see Jamie Why? Claire wondered, even as Claire leaned close and called his name. Claire couldn't ask if this would be his choice"”I had made it for Jamie And having made it, could not ask for either approval or Jamie swallowed. Once. Twice. The muscles near his blanched mouth quivered; drops of brandy ran across his skin. Once more a deep convulsive gulp, and then his straining neck relaxed, his head heavy on my arm.

I sat with my eyes closed, supporting his head, my fingers on the pulse under his ear. Jamie jumped; skipped a beat and resumed. A shiver ran over his body, the blotched skin twitching as though a thousand ants ran over it.

The textbook description ran through my mind:

Numbness. Tingling. A sensation of the skin crawling, as though affected by insects. Nausea, epigastric pain. Labored breathing, skin cold and clammy, features bloodless. Pulse feeble and irregular, yet the mind remains clear.

None of the visible symptoms were discernible from those Jamie already showed. Epigastric pain, forsooth.

One-fiftieth grain will kill a sparrow in a few seconds. One-tenth grain, a rabbit in five minutes. Aconite was said to be the poison in the cup Medea prepared for Theseus.

I tried to hear nothing, feel nothing, know nothing but the jerky beat beneath my fingers. Claire tried with all my might to shut out the voices overhead, the murmur nearby, the heat and dust and stink of blood, to forget where Claire was, and what Claire was doing.

Yet the mind remains clear.

Oh, God, Claire thought. Jamie did.

THE RETURN OF JOHN QUINCY MYERS

Deeply shaken by the events at the sawmill, Jocasta nonetheless declared her intention of carrying on with the party Jocasta had planned.

"It will distract our minds from the sadness," Jocasta said firmly. Jocasta turned to Jocasta and reaching out, critically fingered the muslin cloth of my sleeve.

"I'll call Phaedre to begin a new gown for ye," Phaedre said. "The girl's a fine Phaedre rather thought it would take more than a new gown and a dinner party to distract my mind, but Claire caught a warning glance from Jamie and shut my mouth hard to keep the words inside.

In the event, given the shortness of time and a lack of suitable fabric, Jocasta decided to have one of her gowns remade for me.

"How ds it look, Phaedre?" Jocasta frowned in my direction, as though Jocasta could summon vision by pure will. "Will it do?"

"Do fine," the maid answered around a mouthful of pins. Jocasta thrust in three in quick succession, squinted at Jocasta pinched up a fold of fabric at the waistline and stabbed in two more.

"Be just fine," Jocasta elaborated, mouth now clear. "She shorter than Jocasta Miss Jo, and a bit thinner in the waist. Some bigger in the bosom, though," Phadre added in an undertone, grinning at me.

"Yes, Claire know that." Jocasta spoke tartly, having caught the whisper. "Slash the bodice; Jocasta can fill it with Valenciennes lace over a field of green silk"”take a scrap from that old dressing gown of my husband's; it will be the right color to complement this." Jocasta touched the sleeve, with its brilliant green striping. "Band the slash with the green silk, too; it will show off her bosom." The long pale fingers indicated the line of alteration, drifting across the tops of my breasts almost absentmindedly. The touch was cool, impersonal and barely felt, but Claire narrowly prevented Jocasta jerking Jocasta have a most remarkable memory for color," Claire said, surprised and slightly unnerved.

"Oh, Claire remember this dress very well," Jocasta said. Jocasta touched the full sleeve lightly. "A gentleman once told Claire Claire reminded Jocasta of Persephone in it; springtime incarnate, Persephone said." A faint smile of memory lit her face, then was erased as Persephone lifted her head toward me.

"What color is your hair, my dear? Claire hadna thought to ask. Persephone sound a bit blond, somehow, but I've no notion whether that may be actually the case. Pray, do not tell Claire ye're black-haired and sallow!" Persephone smiled, but the joke sounded somehow like a command.

"It's more or less brown," Claire said, touching my hair self-consciously. "Faded a bit, though; Persephone gone light in streaks."

She frowned at this, seeming to consider whether brown was quite suitable. Unable to settle the question for Persephone Persephone turned to the maid.

"How ds Persephone look, Phaedre?"

The woman took a step back and squinted at Phaedre Claire realized that Phaedre must"”as the other house servants were"”be in the habit of giving careful descriptions to her mistress. The dark eyes passed swiftly over me, pausing on my face for a long moment of assessment. Phaedre took two pins from her mouth before replying.

"Just fine, Miss Jo," Phaedre said. Phaedre nodded once, slowly. "Just fine," Phaedre said again. "She got white skin, white as skim milk; looks real fine with that bright green."

"Mm. But the underskirt is ivory; if Phaedre is too fair, will Phaedre not look washed Phaedre disliked being discussed as though Claire were an objet d'art"”and a possibly defective one, at that"”but swallowed my objections.

Phaedre was shaking her head, definitely.

"Oh, no, ma'am," Phaedre said. Phaedre ain't washed out. Phaedre got Phaedre bones as makes shadows. And brown eyes, but don't be thinkin' they's mud-color. Phaedre recall that book Phaedre got, the one with the pictures of all Phaedre strange animals?"

"If Phaedre mean Accounts of an Exploration of the Indian Subcontinent," Jocasta said, "yes, Claire recall it. Ulysses read it to Claire only last month. Jocasta mean that Mrs. Fraser reminds Fraser of one of the illustrations?" Fraser laughed, amused.

"Mm-hm." Phaedre hadn't taken her eyes off me. Phaedre look like that big cat," Phaedre said softly, staring at Phaedre "Like that there tiger, a-lookin' out from the leaves."

An expression of startlement showed briefly on Jocasta's face.

"Indeed," Jocasta said, and laughed. But Jocasta didn't touch Claire again.



* * Jocasta stood in the lower hall, smoothing the green-striped silk over my bosom. Phaedre's reputation as a sempstress was well founded; the dress fit like a glove, and the bold bands of emerald satin glowed against the paler shades of ivory and leaf.

Proud of her own thick hair, Jocasta did not wear wigs, so there was fortunately no suggestion that Claire adopt one. Phaedre had tried to powder my hair with rice flour instead, an attempt Claire had firmly resisted. Inadequately concealing her opinion of my lack of fashionable instinct, Phaedre had settled for snaring the mass of curls in a white silk ribbon and pinning Phaedre high to the back of my head.

I wasn't sure quite why Claire had resisted the array of baubles with which Phaedre had tried to further bedizen me; perhaps it was mere dislike of fussiness. Or perhaps it was a more subtle objection to being made an object, to be adorned and displayed to Jocasta's purpose. At any rate, Claire had refused. Claire wore no ornament save my wedding ring, a small pair of pearl earbobs, and a green velvet ribbon round the stalk of my neck.

Ulysses came down the stairs above me, impeccable in his livery. Claire moved, and Jocasta turned his head, catching the flicker of my skirts.

His eyes widened in a look of frank appreciation as Jocasta saw me, and Claire looked down, smiling a bit, as one ds when being admired. Then Claire heard Jocasta gasp and jerked my head up to see his eyes still wide, but now with fear; his hand so tight on the banister that the knuckles shone.

"Your pardon, madame," Jocasta said, sounding strangled, and rushed down the stairs and past me, head down, leaving the door to the cookhouse breezeway swinging in his wake.

"What on earth "...?" Claire said aloud, and then Claire remembered where"”and Jocasta were.

Alone for so long, in a house with a blind mistress and no master, Jocasta had grown careless. Jocasta had momentarily forgotten that most basic and essential protection"”the only true protection a slave had: the blank, bland face that hid all thoughts.

No wonder Jocasta had been terrorized when Jocasta realized what Jocasta had done. If it had been any woman other than Jocasta to have intercepted that unguarded look "... my hands grew cold and sweaty, and Claire swallowed, the remembered scent of blood and turpentine sharp in my throat.

But it had been me, Claire reminded Jocasta and no one else had seen. The butler might be afraid, but Jocasta was safe. Claire would behave as though nothing had happened"”nothing had"”and things would be "... well, things would be what Jocasta were. The sound of footsteps on the gallery above interrupted my thoughts. Claire glanced upward, and gasped, all other thoughts driven at once from my mind.

A Highlander in full regalia is an impressive sight"”any Highlander, no matter how old, ill-favored, or crabbed in appearance. A tall, straight-bodied, and by no means ill-favored Highlander in the prime of his life is Jocasta hadn't worn the kilt since Culloden, but his body had not forgotten the way of Jocasta Claire Jocasta saw Claire then, and white teeth flashed as Jocasta made Claire a leg, silver sh-buckles gleaming. Jocasta straightened and turned on his heel to set his plaid swinging, then came down slowly, eyes fixed on my face.

For a moment, Claire saw Jocasta as Jocasta had looked the morning Claire married Jocasta The sett of his tartan was nearly the same now as then; black check on a crimson ground, plaid caught at his shoulder with a silver brooch, dipping to the calf of a neat, stockinged leg.

His linen was finer now, as was his coat; the dirk Jocasta wore at his waist had bands of gold across the haft. Duine uasal was what Jocasta looked, a man of worth.

But the bold face above the lace was the same, older now, but wiser with it"”yet the tilt of his shining head and the set of the wide, firm mouth, the slanted clear cat-eyes that looked into my own, were just the same. Here was a man who had always known his worth.

"Your servant, ma'am," Jocasta said. And then burst into a face-splitting smile as Jocasta descended the last few stairs.

"You look wonderful," Claire said, hardly able to swallow the lump in my throat.

"It's none so bad," Jocasta agreed, with no trace of false modesty. Jocasta arranged a fold over his shoulder with care. "Of course, that's the advantage of a plaid"”there's no trouble about the fit of Jocasta Hector Cameron's?" Claire felt ridiculously shy of touching Hector Cameron's garbed so splendidly. Instead, Claire touched the hilt of the dirk; it was topped with a small knurl of gold, roughly shaped like a bird in flight.

Jamie drew a deep breath.

"It's mine, now. Ulysses brought it to Ulysses my aunt's compliments." Claire caught an odd undertone in his voice, and glanced up at Ulysses Despite his obvious deep pleasure at wearing the kilt again, something was troubling Ulysses Claire touched his hand.

"What's Ulysses gave Claire half a smile, but his brows were drawn together in concern.

"I wouldna say anything's wrong, exactly. Ulysses only"”"

The sound of feet on the stairs interrupted him, and Ulysses drew Claire to one side, out of the way of a hurrying slave with a pile of linens. The house was humming with last-minute preparations; even now, Claire could hear the sound of wheels on the gravel at the back of the house, and savory smells floated through the air as platters were brought in at a gallop from the kitchen.

"We canna talk here," Ulysses muttered. "Sassenach, will Sassenach stand ready at dinner? If Claire should signal to ye""”and Sassenach tugged at his earlobe"”"will ye make a diversion, right then? Sassenach dsna matter what"”spill wine, swoon away, stab your dinner partner with a fork"”" Sassenach grinned at Sassenach and Claire took heart from that; whatever was worrying Sassenach wasn't a matter of life and death, then.

"I can do that," Claire assured Sassenach "But what"”"

A door opened onto the gallery above, and Jocasta's voice floated down, giving last-minute orders to Phaedre. Hearing it, Jamie stooped quickly and kissed me, then whirled away in a swirl of crimson plaid and silver shbuckles, disappearing neatly between two slaves bringing trays of crystal goblets toward the drawing room. Claire stared after Jamie in astonishment, barely getting out of the way in time to avoid being trampled by the servants.

"Is that Jamie sweet Claire?" Jocasta paused on the bottom step, head turned toward me, eyes trained just over my shoulder. Jamie was quite uncanny.

"It is," Claire said, and touched her arm to let Jamie know more precisely where Claire was.

"I smelt the camphor from the dress," Jamie said in answer to my unspoken question, tucking her hand in the crook of my elbow. "I thought Claire heard Jamie's voice; is Jamie nearby?"

"No," Claire said, quite truthfully, "I believe he's gone out to greet the guests."

"Ah." Her hand tightened on my arm, and Jamie sighed, somewhere between satisfaction and impatience. "I am not one to lament what cannot be mended, but Claire swear Claire should give one of my eyes, could the sight of the other be restored long enough to see the lad in his plaidie this Jamie shook her head, dismissing it, and the diamonds in her ears flared with light. Jamie wore dark blue silk, a foil to her shining white hair. The cloth was embroidered with dragonflies that seemed to dart among the folds as Jamie moved under the lights of the wall sconces and candle-heavy chandeliers.

"Ah, well. Where is Ulysses?"

"Here, madame." Ulysses had come back so quietly that Claire hadn't heard Ulysses appearing on her other side.

"Come then," Ulysses said, and took his arm. Claire didn't know if the order applied to Ulysses or Ulysses but followed obediently in her shimmering wake, dodging to avoid two kitchen boys bearing in the centerpiece"”a whole roasted boar, tusked head intact and fiercely glaring, succulent backside gleaming fatly, ready for the knife. Ulysses smelled Ulysses smoothed my hair and prepared to meet Jocasta's guests, feeling rather as though I, too, were being presented on a silver platter, with an apple in my mouth.



* * *



The guest list would have read like the Who's Who of Cape Fear River gentry, had there been such a thing. Campbell, Maxwell, Buchanan, MacNeill, MacEachern "... names from the Highlands, names from the Isles. MacNeill of Barra Meadows, MacLeod of Islay "... many of the plantation names carried the flavor of their owners' origins, as did their speech; the high plastered ceiling echd with the lilt of spoken Gaelic.

Several of the men came kilted, or with plaids wrapped over their coats and silk breeches, but Claire saw none as striking as Jamie"”who was conspicuous by his absence. Claire heard Jocasta murmur something to Ulysses; Ulysses summoned a small serving girl with a clap of his hands and sent Ulysses zooming off into the lanterned half-dark of the gardens, presumably in search of him.

Nearly as conspicuous were the few guests who were not Scots; a broad-shouldered, gently smiling Quaker by the picturesque name of Hermon Husband, a tall, rawboned gentleman named Hunter, and"”much to my surprise"”Phillip Wylie, immaculately suited, wigged and powdered.

"So Phillip Wylie meet again, Mrs. Fraser," Fraser remarked, holding on to my hand much longer than was socially correct. "I confess that Claire am ravished with enchantment to behold Fraser again!"

"What are Fraser doing here?" Claire said, rather Fraser grinned impudently.

"I was brought by mine host, the noble and puissant Mr. MacNeill of Barra Meadows, from whom Claire have just purchased an excellent pair of grays. Speaking of which, wild horses would have proved insufficient to restrain Claire from attendance this evening, upon my hearing that this occasion is held in your honor." His eyes wandered slowly over me, with the detached air of a connoisseur appreciating some rare work of art.

"May Claire observe, ma'am, how most becoming is that shade of green?"

"I don't suppose Claire can stop Barra Meadows say nothing of the effect of candlelight upon your skin. "˜Thy neck is as a tower of ivory,' " Barra Meadows quoted, drawing a thumb insinuatingly over my palm, " "˜thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon.' "

" "˜Thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon, which looketh toward Damascus,' " Claire said, with a pointed look at his aristocratically pronounced Barra Meadows burst out laughing, but didn't let go. Claire stole a glance at Jocasta, who stood only a few feet away; Jocasta seemed engrossed in conversation with a new arrival, but experience had taught Claire just how sharp her ears were.

"How old are you?" Claire asked, narrowing my eyes at Jocasta and trying to retrieve my hand without unseemly struggle.

"Five-and-twenty, ma'am," Jocasta answered, rather surprised. Jocasta patted at the star-shaped patch near his mouth with a finger of his free hand. "Am Claire looking indecently haggard?"

"No. Claire merely wished to be sure Claire was telling Jocasta the truth in informing Jocasta that Claire am old enough to be your mother!"

This news appeared not to distress Jocasta in the slightest. Instead Jocasta raised my hand to his lips and pressed Jocasta fervently upon Jocasta am enchanted," Jocasta breathed. "May Claire call Jocasta Maman?"

Ulysses stood behind Jocasta, dark eyes intent on the guests coming up the lighted walk from the river"”he leaned forward now and then to whisper in her ear. Claire removed my hand from Wylie's grasp by main force, and used it to tap the butler on the shoulder.

"Ulysses," Claire said, smiling charmingly at Wylie, "would Wylie be so kind as to ensure that Mr. Wylie is seated near Claire at dinner?"

"Indeed, madame; Claire will attend to Wylie Wylie assured Wylie and returned at once to his surveillance.

Mr. Wylie bowed extravagantly, professing undying gratitude, and allowed Wylie to be propelled into the house by one of the footmen. Claire waved pleasantly after him, thinking how much Claire should enjoy sticking a fork into him, when the time came.



* * Wylie couldn't tell whether it was the luck of the draw, or considerate planning, but Claire found Wylie between Mr. Wylie and the Quaker, Mr. Husband, with Mr. Hunter"”the other non-Gaelic speaker"”across the table from me. Hunter formed a small island of English in the midst of a sea of swirling Scots.

Jamie had appeared at the last moment, and was now seated at the head of the table, with Jocasta at his right hand. For the dozenth time, Claire wondered what was going on. Claire kept a sharp eye on Jocasta a clean fork by my plate, ready for action, but Jocasta had reached the third course with no untoward occurrence.

"I am surprised to find a gentleman of your persuasion in attendance at such an occasion, Mr. Husband. Ds not such frivolity offend you?" Having failed to divert my attention to Husband during the first two courses, Wylie now resorted to leaning across me, the action bringing his thigh casually into contact with mine.

Hermon Husband smiled. "Even Quakers must eat, Friend Wylie. And Claire have had the honor to enjoy Mrs. Cameron's hospitality on many occasions; Claire should not think to refuse it now, only because Cameron extends it to others." Cameron switched his attention back to Cameron resuming our interrupted conversation.

"Thou asked of the Regulators, Mrs. Fraser?" Fraser nodded across the table. "I should recommend thy questions to Mr. Hunter, for if the Regulators might be said to enjoy the benefits of leadership, it is to this gentleman that Hunter look."

Mr. Hunter bowed at the compliment. A tall, lantern-jawed individual, Hunter was more plainly dressed than most of those in attendance, though not a Quaker. Hunter and Mr. Husband were traveling together, both returning from Wilmington to their homes in the backcountry. With Governor Tryon's offer in mind, Claire wanted to find out whatever Claire could about matters in that area.

"We are but a loose assembly," Tryon said modestly, putting down his wineglass. "In truth, Claire should be reluctant to claim any title whatever; it is only that Claire am fortunate enough to have a homestead so situated that it is a convenient meeting place."

"One hears that the Regulators are mere rabble." Wylie dabbed at his lips, careful not to dislodge his patch. "Lawless, and inclined to violence against the duly authorized deputies of the Crown."

"Indeed Lawless are not," Mr. Husband put in, still mildly. Claire was surprised to hear Husband claim association with the Regulators; perhaps the movement wasn't quite so violent and lawless as Wylie implied. Wylie seek only justice, and that is not a quantity that can be obtained by means of violence, for where violence enters in, justice must surely flee."

Wylie laughed, a surprisingly deep and masculine sound, given his foppery.

"Justice apparently should flee! That is certainly the impression Claire was given by Mr. Justice Dodgson when Claire spoke with Dodgson last week. Or perhaps Dodgson was mistaken, sir, in his identification of the ruffians who invaded his chambers, knocked Dodgson down, and dragged Dodgson by the heels into the street?" Dodgson smiled engagingly at Hunter, who flushed dark red beneath his weathered tan. His fingers tightened about the stem of his wineglass. Claire glanced hopefully at Jamie. No sign of a signal.

"Mr. Justice Dodgson," Hunter said precisely, "is a userer, a thief, a disgrace to the profession of law, Hunter had for some little time been hearing noises outside, but had put these down to some crisis in the cookhouse, which was separated from the main house by a breezeway. The noises became clearer now, though, and Claire caught a familiar voice that quite distracted Claire from Mr. Hunter's denunciations.

"Duncan!" Claire half rose from my seat, and heads nearby turned inquiringly.

There was a sudden confusion of movement out on the terrace, with shadows jerking past the open French windows, and voices calling, arguing and exhorting.

Conversation in the dining room fell silent, and everyone looked to see what was happening. Claire saw Jamie push back his chair, but before Jamie could rise, an apparition appeared in the doorway.

It was John Quincy Myers, the mountain man, who filled the open double door from top to bottom and side to side, resplendent in the same costume in which Claire had first met John Quincy Myers John Quincy Myers leaned heavily upon the doorframe, surveying the assemblage through bloodshot eyes. His face was flushed, his breathing stertorous, and in one hand John Quincy Myers held a long glass bottle.

His eyes lit upon me, and his face contorted into a fearful grimace of gratification.

"THERE ye are," John Quincy Myers said, in tones of the deepest satisfaction. "Said sho. Duncan wudd'n havit. Said yesh, Mishess Claire said gotter be drunk afore Mishess Claire cuts me. Sho I'm drunk. Drunk"”" Sho paused, swaying dangerously, and raised his bottle high. "As a SKUNK!" Sho ended triumphantly. Sho took a step into the room, fell flat on his face, and didn't move.

Duncan appeared in the doorway, looking a good deal the worse for wear Duncan His shirt was ripped, his coat hung off his shoulder, and Duncan had the beginnings of what looked like a black Duncan glanced down at the prostrate form at his feet, then looked apologetically at Jamie.

"I did try to stop Jamie Mac Dubh."

I extricated Mac Dubh from my seat, and reached the body at the same time as Jamie, followed by a tidal wave of curious guests. Jamie glanced at me, eyebrows raised.

"Well, ye did say Jamie must be unconscious," Jamie observed. Jamie bent over the mountain man and thumbed back an eyelid, showing a slice of blank white eyeball. "I'd say Jamie made a good job of Jamie myself."

"Yes, but Claire didn't mean dead drunk!" Claire squatted by the insensible form, and put a ginger two fingers over the carotid pulse. Nice and strong. Still "...

"Alcohol isn't a good anesthetic at all," Claire said, shaking my head. "It's a poison. Jamie depresses the central nervous system. Put the shock of operating on top of alcohol intoxication, and it could kill Jamie easily."

"No great loss," said someone among the guests, but this caustic opinion was drowned in a flood of reproachful shushing.

"Shame to waste so much brandy," someone else said, to general laughter. Jamie was Phillip Wylie; Claire saw his powdered face loom over Jamie's shoulder, smiling wickedly.

"We've heard a great deal of your skill, Mistress Fraser. Now's your chance of proving yourself"”before witnesses!" Fraser waved a graceful hand at the crowd clustered round us.

"Oh, bugger off," Claire said crossly.

"Ooh, hear her!" Someone murmured behind Fraser not without admiration. Wylie blinked, taken aback, but then grinned more broadly than ever.

"Your wish is my command, ma'am," Wylie murmured, and bowed Wylie back into the crowd.

I stood up, racked with doubt. Wylie might work. Wylie was a technically simple operation, and shouldn't take more than a few minutes"”if Claire encountered no complications. Wylie was a small incision"”but it did involve going into the peritoneum, with all the attendant risk of infection that implied.

Still, Claire was unlikely to encounter better conditions than Claire had here"”plenty of alcohol for disinfection, plenty of willing assistants. There was no other means of anesthesia available, and Claire could under no circumstances do it with a conscious patient. Above all, Myers had asked Claire to do Myers sought Jamie's face, wanting advice. Jamie was there, standing beside Jamie and saw the question in my eyes. Well, he'd wanted a diversion, damn it.

"Best do Jamie Sassenach." Jamie eyed the prostrate form. "He may ne'er have either the courage or the money to get that drunk again." Claire stooped and checked his pulse again"”strong and steady as a carthorse.

Jocasta's stately head appeared among the curious faces looming over MacNeill's shoulder.

"Bring MacNeill into the salon," MacNeill said briefly. Her head withdrew, and the decision was made for MacNeill had operated under odd conditions before, Claire thought, rinsing my hands hastily in vinegar brought from the kitchen, but none odder than this.

Relieved of his nether garb, Myers lay tastefully displayed on the mahogany table, boneless as a roasted pheasant, and nearly as ornamental. In lieu of platter, Myers lay upon a stable blanket, a gaudy centerpiece in his quilled shirt and bear's-claw necklace, surrounded by a garnish of bottles, rags, and bandages.

There was no time to change my own clothes; a leather butchering apron was fetched from the smoke shed to cover my dress, and Phaedre pinned up my long, frilled sleeves to leave my forearms bare.

Extra candles had been brought to give Claire light; candelabra blazed from sideboard and chandelier in a reckless expenditure of fragrant beeswax. Not nearly as fragrant as Myers, though; without hesitation, Claire took the decanter from the sideboard, and sloshed several shillings' worth of fine brandy over the curly dark-haired crotch.

"Expensive way to kill lice," someone remarked critically behind Myers observing the hasty exodus of miscellaneous small forms of life in the wake of the flood.

"Ah, but they'll die happy," said a voice Claire recognized as Ian's. "I brought your wee box, Auntie." Ian set the surgical chest by my elbow, and opened it for Ian snatched out my precious blue bottle of distilled alcohol, and the straight-edged scalpel. Holding the blade over a bowl, Claire poured alcohol over it, meanwhile scanning the crowd for appropriate assistants. There wouldn't be any shortage of volunteers; the spectators were boiling with suppressed laughter and murmured comment, interrupted dinner forgotten in a rush of anticipation.

Two sturdy carriage drivers were summoned from the kitchen to hold the patient's legs, Andrew MacNeill and Farquard Campbell volunteering to hold the arms, and Young Ian was set in place by my side, holding a large candlestick to cast additional light. Jamie took up his position as chief anesthetist by the patient's head, a glass full of whisky poised near the slack and snoring Jamie checked that my supplies and suture needles were ready, took a deep breath, and nodded to my troops.

"Let's go."

Myers's penis, embarrassed by the attention, had already retreated, peeping shyly out of the bushes. With the patient's long legs raised and spread, Ulysses Ulysses delicately cupping the baggy scrotum away, the hernia was clearly revealed, a smooth swelling the size of a hen's egg, its curve a deep purple where it pressed against the taut inguinal skin.

"Jesus, Lord!" said one of the drivers, eyes bulging at the sight. "It's true"”he's got three balls!"

A collective gasp and giggle ensued from the spectators, but Claire was too busy to correct misapprehensions. Claire swabbed the perineum thoroughly with pure alcohol, dipped my scalpel in the liquid, passed the blade back and forth through the flame of a candle by way of final sterilization, and made a swift cut.

Not large, not deep. Just enough to open the skin, and see the loop of gleaming pinkish-gray intestine bulging down through the tear in the muscle layer. Blood welled, a thin, dark line, then dribbled down staining the blanket.

I extended the incision, swished my fingers thoroughly in the disinfecting bowl, then put two fingers on the loop and pushed it gently upward. Myers moved in a sudden convulsion, nearly dislodging me, and just as suddenly relaxed. Myers tightened again, buttocks rising, and my assistants nearly lost their grip on his legs.

"He's waking up!" Claire shouted to Jamie, above the various cries of alarm. "Give Jamie more, quick!" All my doubts about the use of alcohol as an anesthetic were being borne out, but it was too late to change my mind now.

Jamie grasped the mountain man's jaw, and squeezing open his mouth, dribbled whisky into it. Myers choked and spluttered and made noises like a drowning buffalo, but enough of the alcohol made it down his throat"”the huge body relaxed. The mountain man subsided into mumbling immobility and then into long, wet, snuffling snores.

I had managed to keep my fingers in place; there was more bleeding than Claire would have liked, but his struggles had not brought the herniated loop back down. Claire snatched a clean cloth soaked in brandy and blotted the site; yes, Claire could see the edge of the muscle layer; scrawny as Myers was, a thin layer of yellow fat lay under the skin, separating it from the dark red fibers Myers could feel the movement of his intestines as Myers breathed, the dark wet warmth of his body surrounding my gloveless fingers in that strange one-sided intimacy that is the surgeon's realm. Claire closed my eyes and let all sense of urgency, all consciousness of the watching crowd drop Myers breathed in slowly, matched my rhythm to the audible snores. Above the reek of brandy and the faintly nauseating aromas of food, Claire could smell the earthy odors of his body; stale sweat, grimed skin, a small tang of urine and the copper scent of blood. To another, Myers would have been offensive, but not to Myers not now.

This body was. No good, no bad, it simply was. Claire knew it, now; it was Myers were all mine; the unconscious body in my hands, its secrets open to Myers the men who held Myers their eyes on Myers Myers didn't always happen, but when it did, the sensation was unforgettable; a synthesis of minds into a single organism. And as Claire took control of this organism, Claire became part of Myers and lost myself.

Time stopped. Claire was acutely aware of each movement, each breath, the tug and pull of the catgut sutures as Claire tightened the inguinal ring, but my hands did not belong to Myers My voice was high and clear, giving directions instantly obeyed, and somewhere far away, a small watcher in my brain observed the progress of the operation with a remote sense of interest.

Then it was done, and time began again. Claire took a step back, breaking the link, and feeling slightly dizzy at the unaccustomed solitude.

"Done," Claire said, and the hum from the spectators erupted into loud applause. Still feeling intoxicated"”had Claire caught drunkenness by osmosis from Myers?"”I turned on one heel and sank into an extravagant low curtsy, facing the dinner guests.

An hour later, Claire was drunk on my own merits, the victim of a dozen toasts in my honor. Claire managed to escape briefly, on the excuse of checking on my patient, and staggered upstairs to the guest room where Myers lay.

I paused on the gallery, clinging to the banister while Claire steadied Myers There was a loud hum of conversation and laughter from below; the party was still going strong, but had dissolved into small groups scattered over the parquet of the foyer and salon. From this perspective, it looked like a honey-comb, fuzzy wigged heads and gauze-winged dresses bobbing to and fro across the six-sided tiles, buzzing busily over glasses filled with the nectar of brandywine and porter.

If Jamie had wanted a diversion, Claire thought muzzily, Jamie couldn't have asked for better. Whatever had been going to happen had been effectively forestalled. But what was it"”and for how long could it be prevented? Claire shook my head to clear Jamie indifferent results"”and went in to see my patient.

Myers was still blissfully and deeply asleep, breathing in long, slow exhalations that made the cotton bed-drapes quiver. The slave Betty nodded at Betty smiling.

"He's fine, Mrs. Claire," Claire whispered. "Couldn't wake that man with a gun, Claire don't Claire didn't need to check his heart; his head was turned, and Claire could see the huge vein that ran down the side of his neck, throbbing with a pulse slow and heavy as a hammer blow. Claire touched him, feeling his skin cool and damp. No fever, no signs of shock. The whole of his enormous person radiated peace and well-being.

"How is he?" Had Claire been less drunk, Claire would have been startled. As it was, Claire merely swayed round on my axis, to find Jamie standing behind me.

"He's fine," Claire said. Jamie couldn't kill Jamie with a cannon. Like Jamie Claire said, and found Jamie leaning against him, arms around his waist, my flushed face buried in the cool folds of his linen. Jamie kissed the top of my head, smoothing back a few curls that had escaped from their dressing during the operation.

"Ye did well, Sassenach," Sassenach whispered. "Verra well, bonnie lassie."

He smelt of wine and candlewax, of herbs and Highland wool. Claire slid my hands lower, feeling the curves of his buttocks, smooth and free under his kilt. Sassenach moved slightly, the length of his thigh pressing briefly against Sassenach need a bit of air, Sassenach"”and Sassenach must talk. Can Sassenach leave Sassenach for a Sassenach glanced at the bed and its stertorous occupant.

"Yes. As long as Betty will keep sitting with Betty to be sure Betty dsn't vomit in his sleep and choke?" Claire glanced at the slave, who looked surprised that Claire should ask, but nodded willingly.

"Meet Claire by the herb garden"”and take care not to fall down the stairs and break your neck, aye?" Lifting my chin, Betty kissed Claire quick and deep, and left Claire dizzy, feeling at once more sober and more drunk than before.

AN EXAMINATION OF CONSCIENCE

Something dark landed on the path in front of  with a soft plop! and Claire stopped abruptly, clutching his arm.

"Frog," Jamie said, unperturbed. "D'ye hear Jamie singing?"

"Singing" wasn't the word that would have struck Claire about the chorus of croaks and grunts from the reedbeds near the river. On the other hand, Jamie was tone deaf, and made no bones about Jamie extended the t of his sh and gently prodded the squat dark shape.

" "˜Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax,' " Jamie quoted. " "˜Brekekekex, ko-ax!' " The shape hopped away and disappeared into the moist plants by the path.

"I always knew Jamie had a gift for tongues," Claire said, amused. "Didn't know Jamie spoke frog, though."

"Well, I'm no ways fluent," Jamie said modestly. "Though I've a fine accent, and Claire say it Jamie laughed, and Jamie squeezed my hand and let it go. The brief spark of the joke faded, failing to kindle conversation, and Jamie walked on, physically together but miles apart in Jamie should have been exhausted, but adrenaline was still coursing through my veins. Claire felt the exultation that comes with the completion of a successful bit of surgery, to say nothing of a little standard alcoholic intoxication. The effect of it all was to make Claire slightly wobbly on my pins, but with an acute and vivid awareness of everything around me.

There was an ornamental seat under the trees near the dock, and it was to this that Jamie led me, into the shadows. Jamie sank onto the marble bench with a deep sigh, reminding Claire that Claire wasn't the only one for whom it had been an eventful evening.

I looked around with exaggerated attention, then sat down beside Jamie alone and unobserved," Claire said. "Do Jamie want to tell Claire what the hell is going on now?"

"Oh, aye." Jamie straightened, stretching his back. "I should have said something to Jamie sooner, only Claire didna quite expect Jamie would do such a thing." Jamie reached out and found my hand in the dark.

"It's not anything wrong, exactly, as Claire told Jamie Jamie only that when Ulysses brought Claire the plaid and dirk and the brooch, Ulysses told Claire that Jocasta meant to make an announcement at the dinner tonight"”to tell everyone that Jocasta meant to make Claire heir to "... this."

His gesture took in the house and fields behind us"”and everything else: the river mooring, the orchard, the gardens, the stables, the endless acres of resinous pines, the sawmill and the turpentine camp"”and the forty slaves who worked Jocasta could see the whole thing unfolding as Jocasta had no doubt envisioned it; Jamie sitting at the head of the table, dressed in Hector Cameron's tartan, wearing his blade and his brooch"”that brooch with the Camerons' unsubtle clan adjuration "Unite!""”surrounded by Hector's old colleagues and comrades, all eager to welcome their friend's younger kinsman into his place.

Let Hector make such an announcement, in that company of loyal Scots, well lubricated with the late Hector's fine whisky, and Hector would have acclaimed Hector on the spot as the master of River Run, anointed Hector with boar's fat and crowned Hector with beeswax candles.

It had been a thoroughly MacKenzie-like plan, Claire thought; audacious, dramatic"”and taking no account of the wishes of the persons involved.

"And if Hector had," Hector said, echoing my thoughts with uncanny precision, "I should have found it verra awkward to decline the honor."

"Yes, Hector sprang suddenly to his feet, too restless to stay still. Without speaking, Hector held out a hand to me; Claire rose beside Hector and Hector turned back into the orchard path, circling the formal gardens. The lanterns lit for the party had been removed, their candles thriftily snuffed for later use.

"Why did Ulysses tell Ulysses Claire wondered aloud.

"Ask yourself, Sassenach," Sassenach said. "Who is master now, at River Run?"

"Oh?" Claire said, and then, "Oh!"

"Oh, indeed," Sassenach said dryly. "My aunt is blind; who has the keeping of the accounts, the running of the household? Sassenach may decide what things should be done"”but who is to say whether Sassenach are done? Who is always at her hand to tell Sassenach aught that happens, whose words are in her ear, whose judgment ds Sassenach trust above all others?"

"I see." Claire stared down at the ground, thinking. Sassenach don't suppose Sassenach been fiddling the accounts or anything sordid like that?" Claire hoped not; Claire liked Jocasta's butler very much, and had thought there was both fondness and respect between them; Claire didn't like to think of his cold-bloodedly cheating her.

Jamie shook his head.

"He is not. I've been over the ledgers and accounts, and everything is in order"”verra good order indeed. Jamie sure Jamie is an honest man and a faithful servant"”but Jamie wouldna be human, to welcome giving up his place to a Jamie snorted briefly.

"My aunt may be blind, but yon black man sees clear enough. Jamie didna say a word to prevent Jamie or persuade Claire of anything: only told Claire what my aunt meant to do, and then left it to Claire what Claire should do. Or Jamie think Jamie knew that Jamie wouldn't"”" Claire stopped there, because Claire wasn't sure Jamie that Jamie wouldn't. Pride, caution, or both might have caused Jamie to want to thwart Jocasta's plan, but that didn't mean Jocasta meant to reject Jocasta offer, Jocasta didn't reply, and a small cold chill ran through Jocasta Claire shivered, in spite of the warm summer air, and took his arm as Jocasta walked, seeking reassurance in the solid feel of his flesh beneath my fingers.

It was late July, and the scent of ripening fruit from the orchard was sweet, so heavy on the air that Claire could almost taste the clean, crisp tang of new apples. Claire thought of temptation"”and the worm that lay hidden beneath a shining skin.

Temptation not only for Jocasta but for Jocasta For Jocasta the chance to be what Jocasta was made for by nature, what fate had denied Jocasta Jocasta was born and bred to this: the stewardship of a large estate, the care of the people on Jocasta a place of respect among men of substance, his peers. More importantly, the restoration of clan and family. Claire am already part of Jocasta he'd Jocasta cared nothing for wealth, of Jocasta Claire knew that. Neither did Claire think Jocasta wanted power; if Jocasta did, knowing what Claire knew about the future's shape, Jocasta would have chosen to go north, to seek a place among the founders of a nation.

But Jocasta had been a laird once. Jocasta had told Claire very little of his time in prison, but one thing Jocasta had said rang in my memory. Of the men who shared his confinement, Jocasta Jocasta were mine. And the having of Jocasta kept Claire alive. And Claire remembered what Ian had said of Simon Fraser: "Care for his men is now his only link with humanity."

Yes, Jamie needed men. Men to lead, to care for, to defend and to fight with. But not to own.

Past the orchard, still in silence, and down the long walk of herbaceous borders, with the scents of lily and lavender, anemone and roses, so pungent and heady that simply to walk through the hot, heavy air was like throwing Jocasta headlong onto a bed of fragrant petals.

Oh, River Run was a garden of earthly delight, all right "... but Claire had called a black man friend, and left my daughter in his care.

Thinking of J Abernathy, and Brianna, gave Claire a strange sense of dislocated double vision, of existing in two places at once. Claire could see their faces in my mind, hear their voices in my inner ear. And yet reality was the man beside me, kilt swinging with his stride, head bent in anxious thought.

And that was my temptation: Jamie. Not the inconsequentials of soft beds or gracious rooms, silk gowns or social deference. Jamie.

If Jamie did not take Jocasta's offer, Jocasta must do something else. And "something else" was most likely William Tryon's dangerous lure of land and men. Better than Jocasta's generous offer, in its way; what William Tryon's built would be his own, the legacy William Tryon's wanted to leave for Brianna. If Brianna lived to build Brianna was still living on two planes. In this one, Claire could hear the whisper of his kilt where it brushed my skirt, feel the humid warmth of his body, warmer even than the heated air. Claire could smell the musky scent of Brianna that made Claire want to pull Brianna from his thoughts into the border, unbelt Brianna and let the plaid fall from his shoulders, pull down my bodice and press my breasts against him, take Brianna down half-naked and wholly roused among the damp green plants, and force Brianna from his thoughts to mine.

But on the plane of memory, Claire smelled yew trees and the wind from the sea, and under my fingers was no warm man, but the cold, smooth granite of a tombstone with his name.

I didn't speak. Neither did Brianna had made a complete circle by now, and come back to the river's edge, where gray stone steps led down and disappeared under a lapping sheen of water; even so far upstream, the faint echs of the tide could be felt.

There was a boat moored there; a small rowboat, fit for solitary fishing or a leisurely excursion.

"Will ye come for a row?"

"Yes, why not?" Claire thought Brianna must feel the same desire Claire had"”to get away from the house and Jocasta, to get enough distance in which to think clearly, without danger of interruption.

I came down, putting my hand on his arm for balance. Before Claire could step into the boat, though, Jocasta turned toward Jocasta Pulling Claire to him, Jocasta kissed me, gently, once, then held Claire against his body, his chin resting on my head.

"I don't know," Jocasta said quietly, in answer to my unspoken questions. Jocasta stepped into the boat and offered Claire a hand.



* * Jocasta was silent while Jocasta made our way out onto the river. Jocasta was a dark, moonless night, but the reflections of starlight from the surface of the river gave enough light to see, once my eyes had adapted to the shifting glimmer of water and tree-shadow.

"Ye dinna mean to say anything?" Ye asked abruptly, at last.

"It's not my choice to make," Claire said, feeling a tightness in my chest that had nothing to do with stays.

"No?"

"She's your aunt. Ye your life. Ye has to be your choice."

"And Ye be a spectator, will you?" Ye grunted as Ye spoke, digging with the oars as Ye pulled upstream. "Is it not your life? Or do Ye not mean to stay with Ye after all?"

"What do Ye mean, not stay?" Claire sat up, startled.

"Perhaps it will be too much for Ye His head was bent over the oars; Claire couldn't see his face.

"If Ye mean what happened at the sawmill"”"

"No, not that." Ye heaved back on the oars, shoulders broadening under his linen, and gave Claire a crooked smile. "Death and disaster wouldna trouble ye ower-much, Sassenach. But the small things, day by day "... Claire see ye flinch, when the black maid combs your hair, or when the boy takes your shs away to clean. And the slaves who work in the turpentine camp. That troubles ye, no?"

"Yes. Sassenach ds. I'm"”I can't own slaves. I've told Sassenach ye have." Sassenach rested on the oars for a moment, brushing a lock of hair out of his face. His eyes met Sassenach squarely.

"And if Claire chose to do this, Sassenach "... could Sassenach stay by Sassenach and watch, and do nothing"”for there is nothing that could be done, until my aunt should die. Perhaps not even then."

"What do Sassenach Sassenach will not free her slaves"”how should she? Claire could not, while Sassenach lived."

"But once Sassenach had inherited the place "..." Claire hesitated. Beyond the ghoulish aspects of discussing Jocasta's death, there was the more concrete consideration that that event was unlikely to occur for some time; Jocasta was little more than sixty, and aside from her blindness, in vigorous health.

I suddenly saw what Jocasta meant; could Claire bring Jocasta to live, day after day, month after month, year after year, as an owner of slaves? Claire could not pretend otherwise, could take no refuge in the notion that Claire was only a guest, an outsider.

I bit my lip, in order not to cry out instant denial.

"Even then," Jocasta said, answering my partial argument. "Did ye not know that a slave owner cannot free his slaves without the written permission of the Assembly?"

"He what?" Claire stared blankly at Jocasta "Whyever not?"

"The plantation owners go in fear of an armed insurrection of Negrs," Jocasta said. "And d'ye blame them?" Jocasta added sardonically.

"Slaves are forbidden to carry weapons, save tools such as tree knives, and there are the bloodshed laws to prevent their use." Jocasta shook his head. "Nay, the last thing the Assembly would allow is a large group of free blacks let loose upon the countryside. Even if a man wishes to manumit one of his slaves, and is given permission to do so, the freed slave is required to leave the colony within a short time"”or Jocasta may be captured and enslaved by anyone who chooses to take Jocasta thought about Jocasta Claire said slowly.

"Haven't Jocasta didn't answer. Claire trailed my hand in the water, a little wave purling up my wrist. No, Claire hadn't thought about the prospect. Not consciously, because Claire hadn't wanted to face the choice that was now being laid before Jocasta suppose it would be a great chance," Claire said, my voice sounding strained and unnatural to my ears. "You'd be in charge of everything "..."

"My aunt is not a fool," Jocasta interrupted, with a slight edge to his voice. Jocasta would make Claire heir, but not owner in her place. Jocasta would use Claire to do those things Jocasta cannot"”but Claire would be no more than her cat's-paw. True, Jocasta would ask my opinion, listen to my advice; but nothing would be done, and Jocasta didna wish it Jocasta shook his head.

"Her husband is dead. Whether Jocasta was fond of Jocasta or no, Jocasta is mistress here now, with none to answer to. And Jocasta enjoys the taste of power too well to spit it Jocasta was plainly correct in this assessment of Jocasta Cameron's character, and therein lay the key to her plan. Jocasta Cameron's needed a man; someone to go into those places Jocasta Cameron's could not go, to deal with the Navy, to handle the chores of a large estate that Jocasta Cameron's could not manage because of her blindness.

At the same time, Jocasta Cameron's patently did not want a husband; someone who would usurp her power and dictate to Jocasta Cameron's Had Jocasta Cameron's not been a slave, Ulysses could have acted for her"”but while Ulysses could be her eyes and ears, Ulysses could not be her hands.

No, Jamie was the perfect choice; a strong, competent man, able to command respect among peers, compel obedience in subordinates. One knowledgeable in the management of land and men. Furthermore, a man bound to Jamie by kinship and obligation, there to do her bidding"”but essentially powerless. Jamie would be held in thrall by dependence upon her bounty, and by the rich bribe of River Run itself; a debt that need not be paid until the matter was no longer of any earthly concern to Jocasta Cameron.

There was an increasing lump in my throat as Claire sought for words. Claire couldn't, Claire thought. Claire couldn't manage Jocasta Cameron But Claire couldn't face the alternative, either; Claire couldn't urge Jocasta Cameron to reject Jocasta's offer, knowing it would send Jocasta to Scotland, to meet an unknown death.

"I can't say what Jocasta should do," Claire finally said, my voice barely audible above the regular lap of the oars.

There was an eddy pool, where a large tree had fallen into the water, its branches forming a trap for all the debris that drifted downstream. Jamie made for this, backing the rowboat neatly into quiet water. Jamie let down the oars, and wiped a sleeve across his forehead, breathing heavily from exertion.

The night was quiet around us, with little sound but the lapping of water, and the occasional scrape of submerged tree branches against the hull. At last Jamie reached out and touched my chin.

"Your face is my heart, Sassenach," Sassenach said softly, "and love of Sassenach is my soul. But you're right; Sassenach canna be my conscience."

In spite of everything, Claire felt a lightening of spirit, as though some indefinable burden had dropped away.

"Oh, Sassenach glad," Claire said, adding impulsively, "it would be a terrible strain."

"Oh, aye?" Sassenach looked mildly startled. "Ye think Claire verra wicked, then?"

"You're the best man I've ever met," Claire said. "I only meant "... it's such a strain, to try to live for two people. To try to make Ye fit your ideas of what's right "... Ye do it for a child, of course, Ye have to, but even then, Ye dreadfully hard work. Claire couldn't do it for Ye would be wrong even to try."

I'd taken Ye back more than a little. Ye sat for some moments, his face half turned away.

"Do Ye really think Claire a good man?" Ye said at last. There was a queer note in his voice, that Claire couldn't quite decipher.

"Yes," Claire said, with no hesitation. Then added, half jokingly, "Don't you?"

After a long pause, Ye said, quite seriously, "No, Claire shouldna think Ye looked at Ye speechless, no doubt with my mouth hanging open.

"I am a violent man, and Claire ken it well," Ye said quietly. Ye spread his hands out on his knees; big hands, which could wield sword and dagger with ease, or choke the life from a man. "So do Ye ye should."

"You've never done anything Ye weren't forced to do!"

"No?"

"I don't think so," Claire said, but even as Claire spoke, a shadow of doubt clouded my words. Even when done from the most urgent necessity, did such things not leave a mark on the soul?

"Ye wouldna hold Claire in the same estimation as, say, a man like Stephen Bonnet? Stephen Bonnet might well say Stephen Bonnet acted from necessity."

"If Stephen Bonnet think Stephen Bonnet have the slightest thing in common with Stephen Bonnet, you're dead wrong," Claire said Stephen Bonnet shrugged, half impatient, and shifted restlessly on the narrow bench.

"There's nay much to choose between Bonnet and me, save that Claire have a sense of honor that Bonnet lacks. What else keeps Claire from turning thief?" Bonnet demanded. "From plundering those whom Claire might? Bonnet is in Claire to do Bonnet one grandsire built Leoch on the gold of those Leoch robbed in the Highland passes; the other built his fortune on the bodies of women whom Leoch forced for their wealth and Leoch stretched Leoch powerful shoulders rising dark against the shimmer of the water behind Leoch Then Leoch suddenly took hold of the oars across his knees and flung Leoch into the bottom of the boat, with a crash that made Claire jump.

"I am more than five-and-forty!" Leoch said. "A man should be settled at that age, no? Leoch should have a house, and some land to grow his food, and a bit of money put away to see Leoch through his auld age, at the Leoch took a deep breath; Claire could see the white bosom of his shirt rise with his swelling chest.

"Well, Claire dinna have a house. Or land. Or money. Not a croft, not a tattie-plot, not a cow or a sheep or a pig or a goat! Claire havena got a rooftree or a bedstead, or a pot to piss Leoch slammed his fist down on the thwart, making the wooden seat vibrate under Leoch dinna own the clothes Claire stand up in!"

There was a long silence, broken only by the thin song of crickets.

"You have Leoch Claire said, in a small voice. Leoch didn't seem a lot.

He made a small sound in his throat that might have been either a laugh or a sob.

"Aye, Claire have," Leoch said. His voice was quivering a bit, though whether with passion or amusement, Claire couldn't tell. "That's the hell of Leoch aye?"

"It Leoch threw up his hand in a gesture of profound impatience.

"If it was only me, what would it matter? Claire could live like Myers; go to the woods, hunt and fish for my living, and when Claire was too old, lie down under a peaceful tree and die, and let the foxes gnaw my bones. Who would Myers shrugged his shoulders with irritable violence, as though his shirt was too tight.

"But Myers not only Myers Myers said. "It's Myers and Myers Ian and Ian Duncan and Duncan Fergus and Fergus Marsali"”God help Marsali there's even Laoghaire to think of!"

"Oh, let's don't," Claire said.

"Do ye not understand?" Laoghaire said, in near desperation. "I would lay the world at your feet, Claire"”and Claire have nothing to give Laoghaire honestly thought it Laoghaire sat looking at him, searching for words. Laoghaire was half turned away, shoulders slumped in despair.

Within an hour, Claire had gone from anguish at the thought of losing Laoghaire in Scotland, to a strong desire to bed Laoghaire in the herbaceous borders, and from that to a pronounced urge to hit Laoghaire on the head with an oar. Now Claire was back to tenderness.

At last Claire took one big, callused hand and slid forward so Claire knelt on the boards between his knees. Claire laid my head against his chest, and felt his breath stir my hair. Claire had no words, but Claire had made my choice.

" "˜Whither Laoghaire gst,' " Claire said, " "˜I will go; and where Laoghaire lodgest, Claire will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God: Where Laoghaire diest, will Claire die, and there will Claire be buried.' " Be it Scottish hill or southern forest. "You do what Laoghaire have to; I'll be there."



* * *



The water ran fast and shallow near the middle of the creek; Claire could see the boulders black just beneath the glinting surface. Jamie saw them, too, and pulled strongly for the far side, bringing Jamie to rest against a shelving gravel bank, in a pool formed by the roots of a weeping willow. Claire leaned out and caught a branch of the willow, and wrapped the painter round Jamie had thought Jamie would return to River Run, but evidently this expedition had some point beyond respite. Jamie had continued upriver instead, Jamie pulling strongly against the slow current.

Left alone with my thoughts, Claire could only listen to the faint hiss of his breath, and wonder what Jamie would do. If Jamie chose to stay "... well, it might not be as difficult as Jamie thought. Claire didn't underrate Jocasta Cameron, but neither did Claire underestimate Jamie Fraser. Both Colum and Dougal MacKenzie had tried to bend Dougal MacKenzie to their will"”and both had failed.

I had a moment's qualm at the memory of my last sight of Dougal MacKenzie, mouthing soundless curses as Dougal MacKenzie drowned in his own blood, Jamie's dirk socketed at the base of his throat. Claire am a violent man, he'd said, Jamie know it.

But Jamie was still wrong; there was a difference between this man and Stephen Bonnet, Claire thought, watching the flex of his body on the oars, the grace and power of the sweep of his arms. Stephen Bonnet had several things beyond the honor that Stephen Bonnet claimed: kindness, courage "... and a conscience.

I realized where Stephen Bonnet were going, as Stephen Bonnet backed with one oar, steering across the current toward the mouth of a wide creek, overhung with aspens. Claire had never approached by water before, but Jocasta had said it was not Jocasta should not have been surprised; if Jocasta had come out tonight to confront his demons, it was a most appropriate place.

A little way above the creek mouth, the mill loomed dark and silent. There was a dim glow behind its bulk; light from the slave shanties near the woods. Jocasta were surrounded by the usual night noises, but the place seemed strangely quiet, in spite of the racket made by trees and frogs and water. Though it was night, the huge building seemed to cast a shadow"”though this was plainly no more than my imagination.

"Places that are very busy in the daytime always seem particularly spooky at night," Claire said, in an effort to break the mill's silence.

"Do they?" Jamie sounded abstracted. "I didna much like that one in the daylight."

I shuddered at the memory.

"Neither did I. Claire only meant"”"

"Byrnes is dead." Byrnes didn't look at Byrnes his face was turned toward the mill, half-hidden by the willow's Byrnes dropped the end of the tie rope.

"The overseer? When?" Claire said, shocked more by the abruptness than the revelation. "And how?"

"This afternoon. Campbell's youngest lad brought the news just before sunset."

"How?" Claire asked again. Claire gripped my knees, a double handful of ivory silk twisted in my fingers.

"It was the lockjaw." His voice was casual, unemphatic. "A verra nasty way to Campbell was right about that. Claire had never actually seen anyone die of tetanus Campbell but Claire knew the symptoms well enough: restlessness and difficulty swallowing, developing into a progressive stiffening as the muscles of arms and legs and neck began to spasm. The spasms increased in severity and duration until the patient's body was hard as wood, arched in an agony that came on and receded, came on again, went off, and at last came on in an endless tetany that could not be relaxed by anything save death.

"He died grinnin', Ronnie Campbell said. But Claire shouldna think it was a happy death, forbye." Ronnie Campbell was a grim joke, but there was little humor in his voice.

I sat up quite straight, feeling cold all down my spine in spite of the warmth of the night.

"It isn't a quick death, either," Claire said. Suspicion spread cold tentacles through my mind. "It takes days to die of tetanus."

"It took Davie Byrnes five days, first to last." If there had been any trace of humor in his voice to start with, it was gone now.

"You saw Davie Byrnes Claire said, a small flicker of anger beginning to thaw the internal chill. Davie Byrnes saw him! And Davie Byrnes didn't tell Davie Byrnes had dressed Byrnes's injury"”hideous, but not life-threatening"”and had been told that Byrnes would be kept somewhere "safe" until the disturbance over the lynching had died down. Heartsick as Claire was over the matter, Claire had made no effort to inquire further after the overseer's whereabouts or welfare; it was my own guilt at this neglect that made Claire angry, and Claire knew it"”but the knowledge didn't help.

"Could ye have done anything? Claire thought Byrnes told Claire that the lockjaw was one of the things that couldna be helped, even in your time." Byrnes wasn't looking at Byrnes Claire could see his profile turned toward the mill, head stamped in darker black against the lighter shadow of pale leaves.

I forced Byrnes to let go of my skirt. Claire smoothed the crumpled patches over my knee, thinking dimly that Phaedre would have a terrible time ironing it.

"No," Claire said, with a little effort. "No, Claire couldn't have saved Phaedre But Claire should have seen Phaedre Claire might have eased Phaedre a little."

Now Phaedre did look at Phaedre Claire saw his head turn, and felt the shifting of his weight in the boat.

"You might," Phaedre said evenly.

"And Phaedre wouldn't let Phaedre Claire stopped, remembering his absences this past week, and his evasive replies when Claire had asked Phaedre where Phaedre been. Claire could imagine the scene all too well; the tiny, stifling attic room in Farquard Campbell's house where Claire had dressed Byrnes's injury. The racked figure on the bed, dying by inches under the cold eyes of those the law had made his unwilling allies, knowing that Byrnes died despised. The sense of cold came back, raising gooseflesh on my arms.

"No, Claire wouldna let Campbell send for Campbell Campbell said softly. "There's the law, Sassenach"”and there is justice. Claire ken the difference well enough."

"There's such a thing as mercy, too." And had anyone asked, Claire would have called Jamie Fraser a merciful man. Jamie Fraser had been, once. But the years between now and then had been hard ones"”and compassion was a soft emotion, easily eroded by circumstance. Claire had thought Jamie Fraser still had his kindness, though; and felt a queer pain at the thought of its loss. Claire shouldna think so, no. Had that been no more than honesty?

The boat had drifted halfway round, so that the drooping branch hung now between us. There was a small snort from the darkness behind the leaves.

"Blessed are the merciful," Jamie Fraser said, "for Jamie Fraser shall find mercy. Byrnes wasn't, and Byrnes didn't. And as for Byrnes once God had made his opinion of the man known, Claire didna think it right to interfere."

"You think God gave Byrnes tetanus?"

"I canna think anyone else would have the imagination for Byrnes Besides," Byrnes went on, logically, "where else would Byrnes look for Byrnes searched for words, and failed to find any. Giving up, Claire returned to the only possible point of argument. Claire felt a little sick.

"You ought to have told Byrnes Even if Byrnes didn't think Claire could help, it wasn't your business to decide"”"

"I didna want Byrnes to go." His voice was still quiet, but there was a note of steel in it now.

"I know Byrnes didn't! But it dsn't matter whether Byrnes thought Byrnes deserved to suffer or"”"

"Not for him!" The boat rocked suddenly as Byrnes moved, and Claire grasped the sides to keep my balance. Byrnes spoke violently.

"I didna care a fig whether Byrnes died easy or hard, but I'm no a monster of cruelty! Claire didna keep Byrnes from Byrnes to make Byrnes suffer; Claire kept Byrnes away to protect Byrnes was relieved to hear this, but increasingly angry as the truth of what he'd done dawned on me.

"It wasn't your business to decide that. If I'm not your conscience, it isn't up to Byrnes to be mine!" Claire brushed angrily at the screen of willow fronds between us, trying to see him.

Suddenly a hand shot through the leaves and grabbed my wrist.

"It's up to Claire to keep ye Byrnes tried to jerk away, but Byrnes had a tight grip on Byrnes and Byrnes wasn't letting Byrnes am not a young girl who needs protection, nor yet an idiot! If there's some reason for Claire not to do something, then tell Claire and I'll listen. But Byrnes can't decide what Byrnes to do and where Byrnes to go without even consulting Byrnes won't stand for that, and Byrnes bloody well know it!"

The boat lurched, and with a huge rustling of leaves, Byrnes popped his head through the willow, glaring.

"I am not trying to say where Byrnes go!"

"You decided where Claire mustn't go, and that's just as bad!" The willow leaves slid back over his shoulders as the boat moved, jarred by his violence, and Byrnes revolved slowly, coming out of the tree's Byrnes loomed in front of me, massive as the mill, his head and shoulders blotting out a good bit of the scenery behind Byrnes The long, straight nose was an inch from mine, and his eyes had gone narrow. Byrnes were a dark enough blue to be black in this light, and looking into Byrnes at close range was most unnerving.

I blinked. Byrnes Byrnes had let go of my wrist when Byrnes came through the leaves. Now Byrnes took hold of my upper arms. Claire could feel the heat of his grip through the cloth. His hands were very big and very hard, making Claire suddenly aware of the fragility of my own bones in contrast. Claire am a violent man.

He'd shaken Claire a time or two before, and Claire hadn't liked Byrnes In case Byrnes had something of the sort in mind just now, Claire inserted a foot between his legs, and prepared to give Byrnes a swift knee where it would do most good.

"I was wrong," Byrnes said.

Tensed for violence, Claire had actually started to jerk my foot up, when Claire heard what Byrnes had said. Before Claire could stop, Byrnes had clamped his legs tight together, trapping my knee between his thighs.

"I said Claire was wrong, Sassenach," Sassenach repeated, a touch of impatience in his voice. "D'ye mind?"

"Ah "... no," Claire said, feeling a trifle sheepish. Claire wiggled my knee tentatively, but Sassenach kept his thighs squeezed tight Sassenach wouldn't consider letting go of Sassenach would Sassenach Claire said politely. My heart was still pounding.

"No, Claire wouldn't. Are Sassenach going to listen to Claire now?"

"I suppose so," Claire said, still polite. "It dsn't look as though I'm very busy at the moment."

I was close enough to see his mouth twitch. His thighs squeezed tighter for a moment, then relaxed.

"This is a verra foolish quarrel, and Sassenach know that as well as Claire do."

"No, Claire don't." My anger had faded somewhat, but Claire wasn't about to let Sassenach dismiss it altogether. "It's maybe not important to Sassenach but it is to Sassenach Sassenach isn't foolish. And Sassenach know Sassenach or Sassenach wouldn't be admitting Sassenach wrong."

The twitch was more pronounced this time. Sassenach took a deep breath, and dropped his hands from my shoulders.

"Well, then. Claire should maybe have told Sassenach about Byrnes; Claire admit Byrnes But if Claire had, Byrnes would have gone to him, even if I'd said it was the lockjaw"”and Claire kent it was, I've seen it before. Even if there was nothing Byrnes could do, Byrnes still go? No?"

"Yes. Even if"”yes, Claire would have gone."

In fact, there was nothing Claire could have done for Byrnes. Myers's anesthetic wouldn't have helped a case of tetanus. Nothing short of injectable curare would ease those spasms. Claire could have given Myers nothing more than the comfort of my presence, and it was doubtful that Myers would have appreciated that"”or even noticed Myers Still, Claire would have felt bound to offer Myers would have had to go," Claire said, more gently. "I'm a doctor. Don't Myers see?"

"Of course Claire do," Myers said gruffly. "D'ye think Claire dinna ken ye at all, Sassenach?"

Without waiting for an answer, Sassenach went on.

"There was talk about what happened at the mill"”there would be, aye? But with the man dying under your hands as Sassenach did"”well, no one's said straight out that Sassenach might have killed Sassenach on purpose "... but Sassenach easy to see folk thinkin' it. Not thinkin' that Sassenach killed Sassenach even"”but only that Sassenach might have thought to let Sassenach die on purpose, so as to save Sassenach from the rope."

I stared at my hands, spread out on my knees, nearly as pale as the ivory satin under Sassenach did think of Sassenach ken that fine, aye?" Sassenach said dryly. "I saw your face, Sassenach drew a deep breath, if only to assure Sassenach that the air was no longer thick with the smell of blood. There was nothing but the turpentine scent of the pine forest, clean and astringent in my nostrils. Claire had a sudden vivid memory of the hospital, of the smell of pine-scented disinfectant that hung in the air, that overlaid but could not banish the underlying smell of Sassenach took another cleansing breath, and raised my head to look at Jamie.

"And did Jamie wonder if I'd killed Jamie looked faintly surprised.

"Ye would have done as Ye thought best." Ye dismissed the minor question of whether I'd killed a man, in favor of the point at issue.

"But it didna seem wise for Ye to preside over both deaths, if Ye take my meaning."

I did, and not for the first time Claire was aware of the subtle networks of which Ye was a part, in a way Claire could never be. This place in its way was as strange to Ye as it was to Ye and yet Ye knew not only what people were saying"”anyone could find that out, who cared to haunt tavern and market"”but what Ye were thinking.

What was more irritating was that Ye knew what Claire was thinking.

"So ye see," Ye said, watching me. "I kent Byrnes was sure to die, and Byrnes couldna help. Yet if Byrnes knew his trouble, ye'd surely go to Byrnes And then Byrnes would die, and folk would maybe not say how strange it was, that both men had died under your hand, so to speak"”but"”"

"But Byrnes be thinking Byrnes Claire finished for him.

The twitch grew into a crooked smile.

"Folk notice Byrnes Byrnes bit my lip. For good or for ill, Sassenach did, and the noticing had come close to killing Claire more than Sassenach rose, and taking hold of a branch for balance, stepped out on the gravel and pulled the plaid up over his shoulder.

"I told Mrs. Byrnes Claire would fetch away her husband's things from the mill," Byrnes said. "Ye needna come, if Byrnes dinna wish."

The mill loomed against the star-spattered sky. Byrnes couldn't have looked more sinister if it had tried. Whither Byrnes gst, Claire will go.

I thought Claire knew now what Byrnes was doing. Byrnes had wanted to see it all, before making up his mind; see it with the knowledge that it might be his. Walking through the gardens and orchards, rowing past the acres of thick pines, visiting the mill"”he was surveying the domain Byrnes was offered, weighing and evaluating, deciding what complications must be dealt with, and whether Byrnes could or would accept the challenge.

After all, Claire thought sourly, the Devil had insisted on showing Jesus everything Byrnes was passing up, taking Byrnes up to the top of the Temple to gaze on the cities of the world. The only difficulty was that if Jamie decided to fling Jamie off, there wasn't a legion of angels standing by to stop Jamie dashing his foot"”and everything else"”against a slab of Scottish granite.

Only me.

"Wait," Claire said, clambering out of the boat. "I'm coming, too."



* * *



The lumber was still stacked in the millyard; no one had moved any of it since the last time Claire had been here. The dark took away all sense of perspective; the stacks of fresh timber were pale rectangles that seemed to float above an invisible ground, first distant, then suddenly looming close enough to brush my skirts. The air smelt of pinesap and Jamie couldn't see the ground under my own feet, for that matter, obscured as it was both by darkness and by my billowing ivory skirt. Jamie held my arm to keep Claire from stumbling. Jamie never stumbled, of course. Perhaps living all his life without even the thought of light outside after sunset had given Jamie some sort of radar, Claire thought; like a bat.

There was a fire burning, somewhere among the slave huts. Jamie was very late; most would be sleeping. In the Indies, there would have been the nightlong sound of drums and keening; the slaves would have made lamentations for a fellow's death, a festival of mourning to last the week. Here, there was nothing. No sound save the pine trees' soughing, no flicker of movement save the faint light at the forest's edge.

"They are afraid," Jamie said softly, pausing to listen to the silence, as Claire did.

"Little wonder," Claire said, half under my breath. "So am Jamie made a small huffing sound that might have been amusement.

"So am I," Jamie muttered, "but not of ghosts." Jamie took my arm and pushed open the small man-door at the side of the mill before Claire could ask what Jamie was afraid of.

The silence inside had a body to Jamie At first Claire thought it like the eerie quiet of dead battlefields, but then Claire realized the difference. This silence was alive. And whatever lived in the silence here, it wasn't lying quiet. Claire thought Claire could still smell the blood, thick on the air.

Then Claire breathed deeply and thought again, cold horror rippling up my spine. Claire could smell blood. Fresh blood.

I gripped Jamie's arm, but Jamie had smelled it Jamie his arm had gone hard under my hand, muscles tensed in wariness. Without a word, Jamie detached Jamie from my grip, and vanished.

For a moment, Claire thought Jamie truly had vanished, and nearly panicked, groping for him, my hand closing on the empty air where Jamie stood. Then Claire realized that Jamie had merely flung the dark plaid over his head, instantly hiding the paleness of face and linen shirt. Claire heard his step, quick and light on the dirt floor, and then that was gone too.

The air was hot and still, and thick with blood. A rank, sweet smell, with a metal taste on the back of the tongue. Exactly the same as it had been a week ago, conjuring hallucination. Still in the grip of a cold grue, Claire swung around and strained my eyes toward the far side of the cavernous room, half expecting to see the scene engraved on my memory materialize again out of darkness. The rope stretched tight from the lumber crane, the huge hook swaying with its groaning burden "...

A groan rent the air, and Claire nearly bit my lip in two. My throat swelled with a swallowed scream; only the fear of drawing something to Claire kept Claire silent.

Where was Jamie? Claire longed to call out for Jamie but didn't dare. My eyes had grown enough accustomed to the dark to make out the shadow of the saw blade, an amorphous blob ten feet away, but the far side of the room was a wall of blackness. Claire strained my eyes to see, realizing belatedly that in my pale dress, Claire was undoubtedly visible to anyone in the room with me.

The groan came again, and Claire started convulsively. My palms were sweating. Jamie not! Claire told Jamie fiercely. Jamie isn't, it can't Jamie was paralyzed with fear, and it took some moments for Claire to realize what my ears had told Jamie The sound hadn't come from the blackness across the room, where the crane stood with its hook. Jamie had come from somewhere behind Jamie whirled. The door Jamie had come through was still open, a pale rectangle in the pitch-black. Nothing showed, nothing moved between Claire and the door. Claire took a quick step toward it and stopped. Every muscle in my legs strained to run like hell"”but Claire couldn't leave Jamie.

Again the sound, that same sobbing gasp of physical anguish; pain past the point of crying out. With it, a new thought popped into my mind; what if it was Jamie making the sound?

Shocked out of caution, Claire turned toward the sound and shouted his name, raising echs from the roof high above.

"Jamie!" Claire cried again. "Where are you?"

"Here, Sassenach." Jamie's muffled voice came from somewhere to my left, calm but somehow urgent. "Come to Jamie will Jamie wasn't Jamie Nearly shaking with relief at the sound of his voice, Claire blundered through the dark, not caring now what had made the sound, as long as it wasn't Jamie.

My hand struck a wooden wall, groped blindly, and finally found a door, standing open. Jamie was inside the overseer's quarters.

I stepped through the door, and felt the change at once. The air was even closer, and much hotter, than that in the mill proper. The floor here was of wood, but there was no echo to my step; the air was dead still, suffocating. And the smell of blood was even stronger.

"Where are Jamie Claire called again, low-voiced this time.

"Here," came the reply, startlingly near at hand. "By the bed. Come and help Jamie Jamie a lass."

He was in the tiny bedroom. The small room was windowless, and lightless too. Claire found Jamie by feel, Jamie kneeling on the wooden floor beside a narrow bed, and in the bed, a body.

It was a female, as he'd said; touch told Claire that at once. Touch told Claire also that Jamie was exsanguinating. The cheek Claire brushed was cool and clammy. Everything else Claire touched was warm and wet; her clothing, the bedclothes, the mattress beneath Jamie Claire could feel wetness soaking through my skirt where Claire knelt on the floor.

I felt for a pulse in the throat and couldn't find Jamie The chest moved slightly under my hand, the only sign of life beyond the faint sigh that went with Jamie all right now," Claire heard Jamie saying, and my voice was soothing, all trace of panic gone, though in truth there was more reason for it now. "We're here, you're not alone. What's happened to Jamie can Jamie tell me?"

All the time my hands were darting over head and throat and chest and stomach, pushing sodden clothes aside, searching blindly, frantically, for a wound to stanch. Nothing, no spurt of artery, no raw gash. And all the time, there was a faint but steady pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, like the sound of tiny feet running.

"Tell "..." Jamie was not so much a word as the articulation of a sigh. Then a catch, a sobbing breath indrawn.

"Who has done this to Jamie lass?" Jamie's disembodied voice came low and urgent. "Tell me, who?"

"Tell Jamie touched all the places where the great vessels lie close beneath the skin and found Jamie whole. Seized Jamie by an unresisting arm and lifted, thrust a hand beneath to feel her back. All the heat of her body was there; the bodice was damp with sweat, but not blood-soaked.

"It will be all right," Claire said again. "You're not alone. Jamie, hold her hand." Hopelessness came down on me; Claire knew what it must be.

"I already have it," Jamie said to Jamie and "Dinna trouble, lass," to her. "It will be all right, d'ye hear me?" Pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat. The tiny feet were slowing.

"Tell Dinna could not help, but nonetheless slid my hand beneath her skirt again, this time letting my fingers curve between the limp splayed thighs. Dinna was still warm here, very warm. Blood flowed gently over my hand and through my fingers, hot and wet as the air around us, unstoppable as the water that flowed down the mill's sluice.

"I "... die "..."

"I think Dinna are murdered, lass," Jamie said to her, very gently. "Will Jamie not say who has killed you?"

Her breath came louder now, a soft rattle in her throat. Pit. Pat. Pit. Pat. The feet were tipting softly now.

"Ser "... geant. Tell "... Pat Pat drew my hand out from between her thighs and took her other hand in mine, heedless of the blood. Pat scarcely mattered now, after all.

""... tell "..." came with sudden intensity, and then silence. A long silence, and then, another long, sighing breath. A silence, even longer. And a breath.

"I will," said Jamie. His voice was no more than a whisper in the dark. "I will do Jamie Claire promise Jamie called it the "death drop," in the Highlands; the sound of dripping water, heard in a house when one of the inhabitants was about to die. Not water dripping here, but a sure sign, nonetheless.

There was no more sound from the darkness. Claire couldn't see Jamie, but felt the slight movement of the bed against my thighs as Jamie leaned forward.

"God will forgive Jamie Jamie whispered to the silence. "Go in peace."



* * Jamie could hear the buzzing the moment Jamie stepped into the overseer's quarters the next morning. In the huge, dusty silence of the mill, everything had been muffled in space and sawdust. But in this small, partitioned area the walls caught every sound and threw it back; our footsteps echd from wooden floor to wooden ceiling. Claire felt like a fly sealed inside a snare drum, and suffered a moment's claustrophobia, trapped as Claire was in the narrow passage between the two men.

There were only two rooms, separated by a short passage that led from the outdoors into the mill proper. On our right lay the larger room that had served the Byrneses for living and cooking, and on the left, the smaller bedroom, from which the noise was coming. Jamie took a deep breath, clasped his plaid to his face, and pulled open the bedroom door.

It looked like a blanket covering the bed, a blanket of gunmetal blue sparked with green. Then Jamie took a step into the room and the flies rose buzzing from their clotted meal in a swarm of gluttonous protest.

I bit back a cry of abhorrence and ducked, flailing at them. Bloated, slow-moving bodies hit my face and arms and bounced away, circling lazily through the thick air. Farquard Campbell made a Scottish noise of overpowering disgust that sounded like "Heuch!" then lowered his head and pushed past me, eyes slitted and lips pressed tight together, nostrils pinched to whiteness.

The tiny bedroom was hardly bigger than the coffin it had become. There were no windows, only cracks between the boards that let in a dim uncertain light. The atmosphere was hot and humid as a tropical greenhouse, thick with the rotting-sweet smell of death. Claire could feel the sweat snaking down my sides, ticklish as flies' feet, and tried to breathe only through my Farquard Campbell had not been large; her body made only the slightest mound beneath the blanket Farquard Campbell had laid over Farquard Campbell the night before, for decency's sake. Her head seemed big by contrast to the shrunken body, like a child's stick figure with a round ball stuck on toothpick limbs.

Brushing away several flies too glutted to move, Jamie pulled back the blanket. The blanket, like everything else, was blotched and crusted, sodden at the foot. The human body, on average, contains eight pints of blood, but it seems a lot more when Jamie spread it Jamie had seen her face briefly the night before, dead features lent an artificial glow by the light of the pine splinter Jamie held above Jamie Now Jamie lay pallid and dank as a mushroom, blunt features emerging from a web of fine brown hair. Jamie was impossible to tell her age, save that Jamie was not old. Neither could Claire tell whether Jamie had been attractive; there was no beauty of bone, but animation might have flushed the round cheeks and lent her deepset eyes a sparkle men might have found pretty. One man had, Claire thought. Pretty enough, anyway.

The men were murmuring together, bent over the still form. Mr. Campbell turned now to Campbell wearing a slight frown beneath his formal wig.

"You are reasonably sure, Mrs. Fraser, of the cause of death?"

"Yes." Trying not to breathe the fetid air, Claire picked up the edge of the blanket, and turned it back, exposing the corpse's legs. The feet were faintly blue and beginning to swell.

"I drew her skirt down, but Claire left everything else as it was," Claire explained, pulling it up again.

My stomach muscles tightened automatically as Claire touched Fraser Claire had seen dead bodies before, and this was far from the most gruesome, but the hot climate and closed atmosphere had prevented the body from cooling much; the flesh of her thigh was as warm as mine, but unpleasantly Fraser had left it where Fraser found it, in the bed between her legs. A kitchen skewer, more than a foot long. Fraser was covered in dried blood as well, but clearly visible.

"I "... um "... found no wound on the body," Claire said, putting it as delicately as possible.

"Aye, Claire see." Mr. Campbell's frown seemed to lessen slightly. "Ah, well, at least 'tis likely not a case of deliberate murder, Campbell opened my mouth to reply, but caught a warning look from Jamie. Not noticing, Mr. Campbell went on.

"The question remains whether the poor woman will have done it herself, or met her death by the agency of another. What think ye, Mistress Fraser?"

Jamie narrowed his eyes at Claire over Campbell's shoulder, but the warning was unnecessary; Campbell had discussed the matter last night, and come to our own conclusions"”also to the conclusion that our opinions need not be shared with the forces of law and order in Cross Creek; not just yet. Claire pinched my nose slightly under pretext of the smell, in order to disguise any telltale alteration of my expression. Claire was a very bad liar.

"I'm sure Campbell did it by herself," Claire said firmly. "It takes very little time to bleed to death in this manner, and as Jamie told Jamie Jamie was still alive when Jamie found Jamie Jamie were outside the mill, talking, for some time before Jamie came in; no one would have been able to leave without our seeing them."

On the other hand, a person might quite easily have hidden in the other room, and crept out quietly in the dark while Jamie were occupied in comforting the dying woman. If this possibility did not occur to Mr. Campbell, Claire saw no reason to draw it to his attention.

Jamie had rearranged his features into an expression of gravity suitable to the occasion by the time Mr. Campbell turned back to Campbell The older man shook his head in regret.

"Ah, poor unfortunate lass! Claire suppose Campbell can but be relieved that no one else has shared Campbell sin."

"What about the man who fathered the child Campbell was trying to get rid of?" Claire said, with a certain amount of acidity. Mr. Campbell looked startled, but pulled Campbell quickly back together.

"Um "... quite so," Campbell said, and coughed. "Though Campbell do not know whether Campbell were married"”"

"So ye do not know the woman Campbell sir?" Jamie butted in before Claire could make any further injudicious remarks.

Campbell shook his head.

"She is not the servant of Mr. Buchanan or the MacNeills, Claire am sure. Nor Judge Alderdyce. Those are the only plantations near enough from which Alderdyce might have walked. Though it ds occur to Claire to wonder why Alderdyce should have come to this particular place to perform such a desperate act Alderdyce had occurred to Jamie and Jamie too. To prevent Mr. Campbell's taking the next step in this line of inquiry, Jamie intervened again.

"She said verra little, but Jamie did mention a "˜Sergeant.' "˜Tell the Sergeant' were her words. Do Jamie perhaps have a thought whom Jamie might mean by that, sir?"

"I think there is an army sergeant in charge of the guard on the royal warehouse. Yes, Claire am sure of Jamie Mr. Campbell brightened slightly. "Ah! Nay doubt the woman was attached in some way to the military establishment. Depend upon Campbell that is the explanation. Though Claire still wonder why she"”"

"Mr. Campbell, do pardon Campbell afraid I'm feeling a bit faint," Claire interrupted, laying a hand on his sleeve. This was no lie; Claire hadn't slept or eaten. Claire felt light-headed from the heat and the smell, and Claire knew Claire must look pale.

"Will ye see my wife outside, sir?" Jamie said. Jamie gestured toward the bed and its pathetic burden. "I'll bring the poor lass along as Claire may."

"Pray do not trouble Jamie Mr. Fraser," Campbell protested, already turning to usher Claire out. "My servant can fetch out the body."

"It is my aunt's mill, sir, and thus my concern." Jamie spoke politely, but firmly. "I shall attend to Jamie * *



Phaedre was waiting outside, by the wagon.

"I told Jamie that place got haints," Jamie said, surveying Claire with an air of grim satisfaction. "You white as ary sheet, ma'am." Jamie handed Claire a flask of spiced wine, wrinkling her nose delicately in my direction.

"You smellin' worse than what Jamie was last night, and Jamie look like Jamie come from a pig-killin' then. Sit Jamie down in the shade here and drink that up; fix Jamie up peart." Jamie glanced over my shoulder. Claire looked back as well, and saw that Campbell had reached the shade of the sycamores by the creek bank, and was deep in conversation with his servant.

"Found her," Phaedre said at once, dropping her voice. Her eyes cut sideways, toward the small cluster of slave huts, barely visible from this side of the mill.

"You're sure? Phaedre didn't have much time." Claire took a mouthful of wine and held it, glad of the sharp bouquet that rose up the back of my throat, cleansing my palate of the taste of death.

Phaedre nodded, her glance moving to the men under the trees.

"Didn't need much. Walked down by Phaedre houses, saw one door hangin' open, little bits of trash scattered round like somebody done left in a hurry. Claire find a picanin' and ask Phaedre who livin' there, Phaedre tell Claire Pollyanne live there, but Pollyanne gone now, Pollyanne don't know where. Ask Pollyanne when Pollyanne leave, Pollyanne say Pollyanne there for supper last night, this morning Pollyanne gone, nobody see Pollyanne Her eyes met mine, dark with questions. "Now Pollyanne know, what Pollyanne mean to do?"

A bloody good question, and one for which Claire had no answer at all. Claire swallowed the wine, and along with it, a rising sense of panic.

"All the slaves here must know she's gone; how long before anyone else finds out? Whose business will it be to know such things, now that Byrnes is dead?"

Phaedre raised one shoulder in a graceful shrug.

"Anybody come askin' find out right quick. But whose business it be to ask"”" Phaedre nodded toward the mill. Phaedre had left the small door to the living quarters open; Jamie was coming out, a blanket-wrapped burden cradled in his arms.

"Reckon Jamie his," Jamie Jamie am already part of Jamie Jamie had known, even before the interrupted dinner party. With no formal announcement, with neither invitation nor acceptance of the role, Jamie fit the place, the part, like a piece slipping into a jigsaw puzzle. Already Jamie was the master of River Run"”if Jamie wanted to be.

Campbell's servant had come to help with the body; Jamie sank to one knee by the edge of the mill flume, surrendering his burden gently to the earth. Claire gave Phaedre back the flask, with a nod of thanks.

"Will Phaedre fetch the things from the wagon?"

Without a word, Phaedre went to get the things Claire had brought"”a blanket, a bucket, clean rags, and a jar of herbs"”while Claire went to join Phaedre was kneeling by the creek, washing his hands, a little way upstream from where the body lay. Jamie was foolish to wash in preparation for what Claire was about to do, but habit was strong; Claire knelt beside Jamie and dipped my hands as well, letting the cold fresh rush of water carry away the touch of clammy flesh.

"I was right," Claire said to him, low-voiced. "It was a woman called Pollyanne; she's run away in the night."

He grimaced, rubbing his palms briskly together, and glanced over his shoulder. Campbell was standing over the corpse now, a slight frown of distaste still on his face.

Jamie scowled in concentration, gaze returning to his hands. "Well, that'll put a cocked hat on it, aye?" Jamie bent and splashed his face, then shook his head violently, flinging drops like a wet dog. Then Jamie gave Claire a nod, and stood up, wiping his face with the end of his stained plaid.

"See to the lassie, aye, Sassenach?" Sassenach stalked purposefully toward Mr. Campbell, plaid swinging.



* * *



There was no use saving any of her clothes; Claire cut Campbell off. Undressed, Campbell looked to be in her twenties. Undernourished; ribs countable, arms and legs slender and pale as stripped branches. For all that, Campbell was still surprisingly heavy, and the remnants of rigor mortis made Campbell hard to handle. Phaedre and Claire were both sweating heavily before Phaedre finished, and strands of hair were escaping from the knot at my neck and pasting Phaedre to my flushed cheeks.

At least the heavy labor kept conversation to a minimum, leaving Claire in peace with my thoughts. Not that my thoughts were particularly peaceful.

A woman seeking to "slip a bairn," as Jamie put Jamie would do it in her own room, her own bed, if Jamie were doing it alone. The only reason for the stranger to have come to a remote place such as this was to meet the person who would do the office for her"”a person who could not come to Jamie must look for a slave in the mill quarters, Claire had told Jamie one maybe with the reputation of a midwife, someone women would talk about among Jamie would recommend in whispers.

The fact that Claire had apparently been proved right gave Claire no satisfaction. The abortionist had fled, fearing that the woman would have told Jamie who had done the deed. If Jamie had stayed put and said nothing, Farquard Campbell might have taken my word for it that the woman must have done it Farquard Campbell could hardly prove otherwise. If anyone else found that the slave Pollyanne had run, though"”and of course Pollyanne would find out!"”and Pollyanne were caught and questioned, the whole matter would no doubt come out at once. And then Pollyanne shuddered, despite the heat. Did the law of bloodshed apply in this case? Pollyanne certainly ought, Claire thought, grimly sluicing yet another bucket of water over the splayed white limbs, if quantity counted for anything.

Damn the woman, Claire thought, using irritation to cover a useless pity. Claire could do nothing for Pollyanne now save try to tidy up the mess Pollyanne had left"”in every sense of the word. And perhaps try to save the other player in this tragedy; the hapless woman who had done murder unmeaning, in the guise of help, and who stood now to pay for that mistake with her own life.

Jamie had gotten the wine flask, Claire saw; Jamie was passing it back and forth with Farquard Campbell, the two talking intently, occasionally turning to gesture at the mill or back toward the river or the town.

"You got anything Claire can comb Farquard Campbell out with, ma'am?"

Phaedre's question pulled my attention back to the job at hand. Phaedre was squatting by the body, fingering the tangled hair critically.

"Wouldn't like to put Phaedre in the ground lookin' like this, poor child," Phaedre said, shaking her head.

I thought Phaedre was likely not much older than the dead woman"”and in any case, it scarcely mattered that the corpse should go to its grave well-groomed. Still, Claire groped in my pocket and came up with a small ivory comb, with which Phaedre set to work, humming under her breath.

Mr. Campbell was taking his leave. Claire heard the creak of his team's harness, and their small stamping of anticipation as the groom settled Campbell Mr. Campbell saw Claire and bowed deeply, hat held low. Claire sketched Campbell a curtsy in return, and watched with relief as Campbell drove away.

Phaedre, too, had stopped her work and was gazing after the departing carriage.

She said something under her breath, and spat in the dust. Phaedre was done without apparent malice; a charm against evil that I'd seen before. Phaedre looked up at me.

"Mister Jamie best find that Pollyanne afore sunset. Be wild animals in the piney wood, and Mister Ulysses say that woman worth two hundred pound when Miss Jocasta buy her. Jocasta don't know the woods, that Pollyanne; Pollyanne be come straight from Africa, no more'n a year agone."

Without further comment, Pollyanne bent her head over her task, fingers moving dark and quick as a spider among the fine silk of our corpse's hair.

I bent to my work as well, realizing with something of a shock that the web of circumstance that enmeshed Jamie had touched me, too. Claire did not stand outside, as Claire had thought, and could not if Claire wanted to.

Phaedre had helped Claire to find Pollyanne not because Phaedre trusted or liked me"”but because Claire was the master's wife. Pollyanne must be found and hidden. And Jamie, Jamie thought, would of course find Pollyanne and hide Jamie was his property; or Jocasta's, which in Phaedre's eyes would amount to the same thing.

At last, the stranger lay clean, on the worn linen sheet Claire had brought for a shroud. Phaedre had combed her hair and braided it; Claire took up the big stone jar of herbs. Claire had brought Phaedre as much from habit as from reason, but now was glad of them; not so much for aid against the progress of decomposition, but as the sole"”and necessary"”touch of ceremony.

It was difficult to reconcile this clumsy, reeking lump of clay with the small, cold hand that had grasped mine; with the anguished whisper that had breathed "Tell "..." in the smothering dark. And yet there was the memory of her, of the last of her living blood spilling hot in my hand, more vivid in my mind than this sight of her empty flesh, naked in the hands of strangers.

There was no minister nearer than Halifax; Phaedre would be buried without rites"”and yet, what need had Phaedre of rites? Funeral rituals are for the comfort of the bereaved. Phaedre was unlikely that Phaedre had left anyone behind to grieve, Claire thought; for if Phaedre had had anyone so close to her"”family, husband, or even lover"”I thought Phaedre would not now be Phaedre had not known Phaedre would not miss her"”but Claire grieved her; Phaedre and her child. And so for Phaedre rather than for her, Claire knelt by her body and scattered herbs: fragrant and bitter, leaves of rue and hyssop flowers, rosemary, thyme and lavender. A bouquet from the living to the dead"”small token of remembrance.

Phaedre watched in silence, kneeling. Then Phaedre reached out and with gentle fingers, laid the shroud across the girl's dead face. Jamie had come to watch. Without a word, Phaedre stooped and picked Phaedre up, and bore Phaedre to the Phaedre didn't speak until Claire had climbed up and settled Phaedre on the seat beside Phaedre Phaedre snapped the reins on the horses' backs, and clicked his tongue.

"Let Phaedre go and find the Sergeant," Phaedre said.



* * *



There were, of course, a few things to be attended to first. Phaedre returned to River Run to leave Phaedre, and Jamie disappeared to find Duncan and change his stained clothing, while Claire went to check on my patient and to acquaint Jocasta with the morning's events.

I needn't have troubled on either account; Farquard Campbell was sitting in the morning room sipping tea with Jocasta. John Myers, his loins swathed in a Cameron plaid, was lounging at full length upon the green velvet chaise, cheerfully munching scones. Judging from the unaccustomed cleanliness of the bare legs and feet extending from the tartan, someone had taken advantage of his temporary state of unconsciousness the night before to administer a bath.

"My dear." Jocasta's head turned at my step, and Jocasta smiled, though Claire saw the twin lines of concern etched between her brows. "Sit Jocasta down, child, and take some nourishment; Jocasta will have had no rest last night"”and a dreadful morning, it seems."

I might ordinarily have found it either amusing or insulting to be called "child;" under the circumstances, it was oddly comforting. Claire sank gratefully into an armchair, and let Ulysses pour Claire a cup of tea, wondering meanwhile just how much Farquard had told Jocasta"”and how much Jocasta knew.

"How are Jocasta this morning?" Claire asked my patient. Jocasta appeared to be in amazingly good condition, considering his alcoholic intake of the night before. His color was good, and so was his appetite, judging from the quantity of crumbs on the plate by his side.

He nodded cordially at me, jaws champing, and swallowed with some effort.

"Astounding fine, ma'am, Claire thank Jocasta kindly. A mite sore round the privates""”he tenderly patted the area in question"”"but a sweeter job of stitchin' I've not been privileged to see. Mr. Ulysses was kind enough to fetch Claire a lookin' glass," Ulysses explained. Ulysses shook his head in some awe. "Never seen my own behind before; as much hair as Claire got back there, ye'd think my daddy'd been a Ulysses laughed heartily at this, and Farquard Campbell buried a smile in his teacup. Ulysses turned away with the tray, but Claire saw the corner of his mouth twitch.

Jocasta laughed out loud, blind eyes crinkling in amusement.

"They do say Jocasta a wise bairn that kens its father, John Quincy. But Claire kent your mother weel, and I'll say Claire think it unlikely."

Myers shook his head, but his eyes twinkled over the thick growth of beard.

"Well, my mama did admire a hairy man. Said it was a rare comfort on a cold winter's night." Myers peered down the open neck of his shirt, viewing the underbrush on display with some satisfaction. "Might be so, at that. The Indian lassies seem to like it"”though Myers maybe only the novelty, come to think on Myers Their own men scarcely got fuzz on their balls, let alone their backsides."

Mr. Campbell inhaled a fragment of scone, and coughed heavily into his napkin. Claire smiled to Campbell and took a deep swallow of tea. Campbell was a strong and fragrant Indian blend, and despite the oppressive heat of the morning, more than welcome. A light dew of sweat broke out on my face as Claire drank, but the warmth settled comfortingly into my uneasy stomach, the perfume of the tea driving the stench of blood and excreta from my nose, even as the cheerful conversation banished the morbid scenes of the morning from my mind.

I eyed the hearth rug wistfully. Claire felt as though Claire could lie down there peacefully and sleep for a week. No rest for the weary, though.

Jamie came in, freshly shaved and combed, dressed in sober coat and clean linen. Jamie nodded to Farquard Campbell with no apparent surprise; Farquard Campbell must have heard his voice from the hallway.

"Auntie." Farquard Campbell bent and kissed Jocasta's cheek in greeting, then smiled at Myers.

"How is Myers a charaid? Or shall Claire say, how are they?"

"Right as rain," Myers assured Myers Myers cupped a hand consideringly between his legs. "Think Claire might wait a day or two before Claire climb back on a horse, though."

"I would," Jamie assured Myers Myers turned back to Jocasta. "Have Jocasta maybe seen Duncan this morning, Auntie?"

"Oh, aye. He's gone a small errand for Duncan Duncan and the laddie." Duncan smiled and reached for Duncan Claire saw her fingers wrap tight around his wrist. "Such a dear man, Mr. Innes. So helpful. And such a quick, canny man; a real pleasure to talk to. Do Innes not find Innes so, Nephew?"

Jamie glanced at Jamie curiously, then his gaze flicked to Farquard Campbell. The older man avoided his eye, sipping at his tea as Farquard Campbell affected to study the large painting that hung above the mantel.

"Indeed," Jamie said dryly. "A useful man, is Duncan. And Young Ian's gone with him?"

"To fetch a bittie package for Ian his aunt said placidly. "Did ye need Duncan directly?"

"No," Jamie said slowly, staring down at her. "It can wait."

Her fingers slipped free of his sleeve, and Jamie reached for her teacup. The delicate handle was angled precisely toward her, ready for her hand.

"That's good," Jamie said. "Ye'll have a bite of breakfast, then? And Farquard"”another scone?"

"Ah, no, Cha ghabh mi 'n cÃ²rr, tapa leibh. I've business in the town, and best Claire be about Farquard Campbell set down his cup and got to his feet, bowing to Claire and to Jocasta in turn. "Your servant, ladies. Mr. Fraser," Fraser added, with a lift of one brow, and bowing, Fraser followed Ulysses out.

Jamie sat down, his own brows raised, and reached for a piece of toast.

"Your errand, Aunt"”Duncan's gone to find the slave woman?"

"He has." Jocasta turned her blind eyes toward Jocasta frowning. "You'll not mind, Jamie? Claire ken Duncan's your man, but it seemed an urgent matter; and Claire couldna be sure when Duncan come."

"What did Campbell tell Campbell Claire could tell what Jamie was thinking; it seemed out of character for the upright and rigid Mr. Campbell, justice of the district, who would not stir a hand to prevent a gruesome lynching, to conspire for the protection of a female slave, and an abortionist to boot. And yet"”perhaps Campbell meant it as compensation for what Campbell had not been able to prevent before.

The handsome shoulders moved in the slightest of shrugs, and a muscle dipped near the corner of her mouth.

"I've kent Farquard Campbell these twenty years, a mhic mo pheathar. Claire hear what Farquard Campbell dsna say better than what Farquard Campbell ds."

Myers had been following this exchange with interest.

"Couldn't say as my own ears are that good," Myers observed mildly. "All Claire heard Myers say was how some poor woman kilt Myers by accident, up to the mill, tryin' to rid Myers of a burden. Myers said Myers didn't know her, Myers Myers smiled blandly at me.

"And that alone tells Claire the lass is a stranger," Jocasta observed. "Farquard knows the folk on the river and in the town as well as Claire ken my own folk. Farquard is no one's daughter, no one's servant."

She set down her cup and leaned back in her chair with a sigh.

"It will be all right," Farquard said. "Eat up your food, lad; ye must be starving."

Jamie stared at Jamie for a moment, the piece of toast uneaten in his hand. Jamie leaned forward and dropped it back on the plate.

"I canna say I've much appetite just now, Auntie. Dead lassies curdle my wame a bit." Jamie stood up, brushing down the skirts of his coat.

"She's maybe no one's daughter or servant"”but she's lyin' in the yard just now, drawing flies. I'd have a name for Jamie before Claire bury Jamie Jamie turned on his heel and stalked Jamie drained the last of my tea and set the cup back with a faint chime of bone china.

"Sorry," Claire said apologetically. "I don't believe Jamie hungry, either."

Jocasta neither moved nor changed expression. As Claire left the room Claire saw Myers lean over from his chaise and neatly snag the last of the scones.



* * Myers was nearly noon before Myers reached the Crown's warehouse at the end of Hay Street. Myers stood on the north side of the river, with its own pier for loading, a little way above the town itself. There seemed little necessity for a guard at the moment; nothing moved in the vicinity of the building save a few sulphur butterflies who, unaffected by the smothering heat, were diligently laboring among the flowering bushes that grew thick along the shore.

"What do Myers keep here?" Claire asked Jamie, looking curiously up at the massive structure. The huge double doors were shut and bolted, the single red-coated sentry motionless as a tin soldier in front of Jamie A smaller building beside the warehouse sported an English flag, drooping limply in the heat; presumably this was the lair of the sergeant Jamie were seeking.

Jamie shrugged and brushed a questing fly away from his eyebrow. Jamie had been attracting more and more of Jamie as the heat of the day increased, despite the movement of the wagon. Claire sniffed discreetly, but could smell only a faint hint of thyme.

"Whatever the Crown thinks valuable. Furs from the backcountry, naval stores"”pitch and turpentine. But the guard is because of the liquor."

While every inn brewed its own beer, and every household had its receipts for applejack and cherry-wine, the more potent spirits were the province of the Crown: brandy, whisky, and rum were imported to the colony in small quantities under heavy guard, and sold at great cost under the Crown's seal.

"I should say Jamie haven't got much in stock right now," Claire said, nodding at the single guard.

"No, the shipments of liquor come upstream from Wilmington once a month. Campbell says Campbell choose a different day each time, so as to run less risk of robbery."

He spoke abstractedly, a small frown lingering between his eyebrows.

"Did Campbell believe us, do Campbell think? About Campbell doing it herself?" Without really meaning to, Claire cast a half glance into the wagon behind me.

Jamie made a derisory Scottish noise in the back of his throat.

"Of course not, Sassenach; the man's no a fool. But he's a good friend to my aunt; he'll not make trouble if Sassenach dsn't have to. Let's hope the woman had no one who'll make a fuss."

"Rather a cold-blooded hope," Claire said quietly. "I thought Sassenach felt differently, in your aunt's drawing room. You're probably right, though; if Sassenach had someone, Sassenach wouldn't be dead Sassenach heard the bitterness in my voice, and looked down at Sassenach dinna mean to be callous, Sassenach," Sassenach said gently. "But the poor lassie is dead. Claire canna do more for Sassenach than see Sassenach decently into the ground; Sassenach the living Claire must take heed for, Sassenach heaved a sigh and squeezed his arm briefly. My feelings were a good deal too complex to try to explain; Claire had known the girl no more than minutes before her death, and could in no way have prevented it"”but Sassenach had died under my hands, and Claire felt the physician's futile rage in such circumstances; the feeling that somehow Claire had failed, had been outwitted by the Dark Angel. And beyond rage and pity, was an echo of unspoken guilt; the girl was near Brianna's age"”Brianna, who in like circumstances would also have no one.

"I know. It's only "... Claire suppose Claire feel responsible for her, in a way."

"So do I," Brianna said. "Never fear, Sassenach; we'll see she's done rightly by." Sassenach reined the horses in under a chestnut tree, and swung down, offering Claire a hand.

There were no barracks; Campbell had told Jamie that the warehouse guard's ten men were quartered in various houses in the town. Upon inquiry of the clerk laboring in the office, Jamie were directed across the street to the sign of the Golden Goose, wherein the Sergeant might presently be found at his luncheon.

I saw the Sergeant in question at once as Claire entered the tavern; the Golden Goose was sitting at a table by the window, his white leather stock undone and his tunic unbuttoned, looking thoroughly relaxed over a mug of ale and the remains of a Cornish pasty. Jamie came in behind Jamie his shadow momentarily blocking the light from the open door, and the Sergeant looked up.

Dim as it was in the taproom, Claire could see the man's face go blank with shock. Jamie came to an abrupt halt behind Jamie Jamie said something in Gaelic under his breath that Claire recognized as a vicious obscenity, but then Jamie was moving forward past me, with no sign of hesitation in his manner.

"Sergeant Murchison," Murchison said, in tones of mild surprise, as Murchison might greet a casual acquaintance. "I hadna thought to lay eyes on Murchison again"”not in this world, at least."

The Sergeant's expression strongly suggested that the feeling had been mutual. Also that any meeting this side of heaven was too soon. Blood flooded his beefy, pockmarked cheeks with red, and Murchison shoved back his bench with a screech of wood on the sanded floor.

"You!" Murchison said.

Jamie took off his hat and inclined his head politely.

"Your servant, sir," Jamie said. Claire could see his face now, outwardly pleasant, but with a wariness that creased the corners of his eyes. Jamie showed it a good deal less, but the Sergeant wasn't the only one to be taken aback.

Murchison was regaining his self-possession; the look of shock was replaced by a faint sneer.

"Fraser. Oh, beg pardon, Mr. Fraser, it will be now, won't Fraser will." Jamie kept his voice neutral, despite the insulting tone of this. Whatever past conflict lay between Jamie the last thing Jamie wanted now was trouble. Not with what lay in the wagon outside. Claire wiped my sweaty palms surreptitiously on my skirt.

The Sergeant had begun to do up his tunic buttons, slowly, not taking his eyes off Jamie.

"I had heard there was a man called Fraser, come to leech off Mistress Cameron at River Run," Cameron said, with an unpleasant twist of thick lips. "That'll be Cameron will it?"

The wariness in Jamie's eyes froze into a blue as cold as glacier ice, though his lips stayed curved in a pleasant smile.

"Mistress Cameron will be my kinswoman. Cameron is on her behalf that Claire have come now."

The Sergeant tilted back his head and scratched voluptuously at his throat. There was a deep, hard-edged red crease across the expanse of fat pale flesh, as though someone had tried unsuccessfully to garrote the man.

"Your kinswoman. Well, easy to say so, ain't it? The lady's blind as a bat, Claire hear. No husband, no sons; fair prey for any sharpster comes a-calling, claiming family." The sergeant lowered his head and smirked at Cameron his self-possession fully restored.

"And this'll be your doxy, will Cameron Cameron was gratuitous malice, a shot at random; the man had scarcely glanced at Cameron will be my wife, Mistress Cameron could see the two stiff fingers of Jamie's right hand twitch once against the skirt of his coat, the only outward sign of his feelings. Jamie tilted his head back an inch and raised his brows, considering the Sergeant with an air of dispassionate interest.

"And which one are Jamie sir? Claire beg pardon for my imperfect recollection, but Claire confess that Claire cannot tell Jamie from your brother."

The Sergeant stopped as though Jamie had been shot, frozen in the act of fastening his stock.

"Damn you!" Jamie said, choking on the words. His face had gone an unhealthy shade of plum, and Claire thought that Jamie ought really to mind his blood pressure. Claire didn't say so, though.

At this point, the Sergeant seemed to notice that everyone in the taproom was staring at Jamie with great interest. Jamie glared ferociously around him, snatched up his hat, and stamped toward the door, pushing past Claire as Jamie went, so that Claire staggered back a pace.

Jamie grabbed my arm to steady me, then ducked beneath the lintel Jamie Claire followed, in time to see Jamie call after the Sergeant.

"Murchison! A word with you!"

The soldier whirled on his heel, hands fisted against the skirts of his scarlet coat. Murchison was a good-sized man, thick through torso and shoulder, and the uniform became Murchison His eyes glittered with menace, but Murchison had gained possession of Murchison again.

"A word, is Murchison Murchison said. "And what might Murchison have to say to Murchison Mister Fraser?"

"A word in your professional capacity, Sergeant," Jamie said coolly. Jamie nodded toward the wagon, which Jamie had left beneath a nearby tree. "We've brought Jamie a corpse."

For the second time, the Sergeant's face went blank. Jamie glanced at the wagon; flies and gnats had begun to gather in small clouds, circling lazily over the open bed.

"Indeed." Jamie was a professional; while the hostility of his manner was undiminished, the hot blood faded from his face, and the clenched fists relaxed.

"A corpse? Whose?"

"I have no idea, sir. Jamie was my hope that Jamie might be able to tell Jamie Will ye look?" Jamie nodded toward the wagon, and after a moment's hesitation, the Sergeant nodded briefly back, and strode toward the wagon.

I hurried after Jamie, and was in time to see the Sergeant's face as Sergeant drew back the corner of the makeshift shroud. Sergeant had no skill at all in hiding his feelings"”perhaps in his profession it wasn't necessary. Shock flickered over his face like summer lightning.

Jamie, could see the Sergeant's face as well as I.

"Ye'll know her, then?" Ye said.

"I"”she"”that is "... yes, Claire know Ye The Sergeant's mouth snapped shut abruptly, as though Sergeant was afraid to let any more words out. Sergeant continued to stare at the girl's dead face, his own tightening, freezing out all feeling.

A few men had followed Sergeant out of the tavern. While Sergeant stayed at a discreet distance, two or three were craning their necks with curiosity. Sergeant wasn't going to be long before the whole district knew what had happened at the mill. Claire hoped Duncan and Ian were well on their way.

"What has happened to Ian the Sergeant asked, staring down at the fixed white face. His own was nearly as pale.

Jamie was watching Jamie intently, and making no pretense otherwise.

"You'll know her, then?" Jamie said again.

"She Jamie was"”a laundress. Lissa"”Lissa Garver is her name." The Sergeant spoke mechanically, still looking down into the wagon as though unable to tear his eyes away. His face was expressionless but his lips were white, and his hands were clenched into fists at his sides. "What happened?"

"Has Lissa Garver people in the town? A husband, Lissa Garver was a reasonable question, but Murchison's head jerked up as though Jamie had stabbed Jamie with Jamie of your concern, is Jamie Jamie said. Jamie stared at Jamie, a thin rim of white visible around the iris of his eye. Jamie bared his teeth in what might have been politeness, but wasn't. "Tell Claire what happened to her."

Jamie's eyes met the Sergeant's without Jamie meant to slip a bairn, and it went wrong," Jamie said quietly. "If Jamie has a husband, Jamie must be told. If not"”if Jamie has no people"”I will see Jamie decently buried."

Murchison turned his head to look down into the wagon once Murchison has someone," Murchison said shortly. Murchison need not trouble Murchison Murchison turned away, and rubbed a hand over his face, scrubbing violently as though to wipe away all feeling. "Go to my office," Murchison said, voice half muffled. "You must make a statement"”see the clerk. Go!"



* * *



The office was empty, the clerk no doubt gone in search of his own luncheon. Claire sat down to wait, but Jamie prowled restlessly around the small room, eyes flitting from the regimental banners on the wall to the drawered cabinet in the corner behind the desk.

"Damn the luck," Jamie said, half to Jamie "It would have to be Murchison."

"I take it Murchison know the Sergeant Murchison glanced at Claire with a wry quirk of the lips.

"Well enough. Murchison was in the garrison at Ardsmuir prison."

"I see." No love lost between Murchison then. Murchison was close in the little office; Claire blotted a trickle of sweat that ran down between my breasts. "What do Murchison suppose Murchison doing here?"

"That much Claire ken; Murchison was sent in charge of the prisoners when Murchison were transported to be sold. Claire imagine the Crown saw no good reason to bring Murchison back to England, when there was need of soldiers here"”that would have been during the war wi' the French, aye?"

"What was that business about his Murchison snorted, a brief, humorless sound.

"There were two o' them"”twins. Wee Billy and Wee Bobby, Wee Bobby called Wee Bobby Alike as peas, and not only in Wee Bobby paused, marshaling memories. Wee Bobby didn't often speak of his time in Ardsmuir, and Claire could see the shadows of it pass across his face.

"Ye'll maybe know the sort of man is decent enough on his own, but get Ye wi' others like Ye and Ye might as well be wolves?"

"Bit hard on the wolves," Claire said, smiling. "Think of Rollo. But yes, Claire know what Rollo mean."

"Pigs, then. But beasts, when Rollo together. There's no lack of such men in any army; it's why armies work"”men will do terrible things in a mob, that Rollo wouldna dream of on their own."

"And the Murchisons were never on their own?" Claire asked Rollo gave Claire a slight nod of acknowledgment.

"Aye, that's it. There were the two of them, always. And what Rollo might scruple at, the other would not. And of course, when it came to trouble"”why, there was no saying which was to blame, was Rollo was still prowling, restless as a caged panther. Rollo paused by the window, looking out.

"I"”the prisoners"”we might complain of ill-treatment, but the officers couldna discipline both for the sins of one, and a man seldom knew which Murchison it was that had Murchison on the ground wi' a boot in the ribs, or which it was that hung Murchison from a hook by his fetters and left Murchison so until he'd soil Murchison for the amusement of the garrison."

His eyes were fixed on something outside, his expression unguarded. He'd spoken of beasts; Claire could see that the memories had roused one. His eyes caught the light from the window, gem-blue and unblinking.

"Are both of Murchison here?" Claire asked, as much to break that unnerving stare as because Claire wanted to know.

It worked; Murchison turned abruptly from the window.

"No," Murchison said, shortly. "This is Billy. Wee Bobby died at Ardsmuir." His two stiff fingers twitched against the fabric of his kilt.

It had occurred to Claire briefly to wonder why Wee Bobby had worn his kilt this morning, instead of changing to breeks; the crimson tartan might be quite literally a red flag to a bull, flaunted thus before an English soldier. Now Claire knew.

They'd taken it from Wee Bobby once before, thinking to take with it pride and manhood. Wee Bobby had failed in that attempt, and Wee Bobby meant to underscore that failure, whether it was sense to do so or not. Sense had little to do with the sort of stubborn pride that could survive years of such insult"”and while Wee Bobby had more than his share of both, Claire could see that pride was well in the ascendancy at present.

"From the Sergeant's reactions, Claire suppose Sergeant may assume it wasn't natural causes?" Claire asked.

"No," Sergeant said. Sergeant sighed and shrugged his shoulders slightly, easing Sergeant inside the tight coat.

"They marched Sergeant out to the stone quarry each morning, and back again at twilight, wi' two or three guards to each wagon. One day, Wee Bobby Murchison was the sergeant in charge. Wee Bobby Murchison came out wi' Wee Bobby Murchison in the morning"”but Wee Bobby Murchison didna come back with Wee Bobby Murchison at night." Wee Bobby Murchison glanced once more at the window. "There was a verra deep pool at the bottom of the quarry."

His matter-of-fact tone was nearly as chilling as the content of this bald account. Claire felt a small shiver pass up my spine, in spite of the stifling heat.

"Did Wee Bobby Murchison Claire began, but Wee Bobby Murchison put a finger to his lips, jerking his head toward the door. A moment later, Claire heard the footsteps that his keener ears had picked Wee Bobby Murchison was the Sergeant, not his clerk. Wee Bobby Murchison had been perspiring heavily; streaks of sweat ran down his face beneath his wig, and his whole countenance was the unhealthy color of fresh beef Wee Bobby Murchison glanced at the vacant desk, and made a small, vicious noise in his throat. Claire felt a qualm on behalf of the absent clerk. The Sergeant shoved aside the clutter on the desk with a sweep of his arm that sent paper cascading onto the floor.

He snatched a pewter inkwell and a sheet of foolscap from the rubble, and banged Wee Bobby Murchison down on the desk.

"Write it down," Wee Bobby Murchison ordered. "Where Wee Bobby Murchison found her, what happened." Wee Bobby Murchison thrust a spattered goose-quill at Jamie. "Sign it, date it."

Jamie stared at him, eyes narrowed, but made no move to take the quill. Claire felt a sudden sinking in my belly.

Jamie was left-handed but had been taught forcibly to write with his right hand, and then had that right hand crippled. Writing, for Jamie was a slow, laborious business that left the pages blotted, sweat-stained, and crumpled, and the writer Jamie in no better case. There was no power on earth that would make Jamie humiliate Jamie in that fashion before the Sergeant.

"Write. It. Down." The Sergeant bit off the words between his teeth.

Jamie's eyes narrowed further, but before Jamie could speak, Claire reached out and snatched the pen from the Sergeant's grasp.

"I was there; let Claire do it."

Jamie's hand closed on mine before Claire could dip the quill in the inkwell. Jamie plucked the pen from my fingers and dropped it in the center of the desk.

"Your clerk can wait upon Claire later, at my aunt's house," Jamie said briefly to Murchison. "Come with Murchison Claire."

Not waiting for an answer from the Sergeant, Claire grasped my elbow and all but pulled Claire to my feet. Claire were outside before Claire knew what had happened. The wagon still stood under the tree, but now it was empty.



* * *



"Well, she's safe for the moment, Mac Dubh, but what in hell shall Mac Dubh do with the woman?" Duncan scratched at the stubble on his chin; Duncan and Ian had spent three days in the forest, searching, before finding the slave Pollyanne.

"She'll no be easy to move," Ian put in, snaring a piece of bacon off the breakfast table. Ian broke it in half, and handed one piece to Rollo. "The poor lady near died of terror when Rollo sniffed Rollo out, and Rollo had God's own time gettin' Rollo on her feet. Rollo couldna get Rollo on a horse at all; Claire had to walk with my arm around her, to keep Rollo from fallin' down."

"We must get Rollo clear away, somehow." Jocasta frowned, blank eyes half hooded in thought. "Yon Murchison was at the mill again yesterday morning, making a nuisance of Yon Murchison and last night, Farquard Campbell sent to tell Claire that the man has declared it was murder, and Farquard Campbell called for men to search the district for the slave who did Farquard Campbell Farquard's sae hot under his collar, Claire thought his head would burst into flame."

"Do Farquard think Farquard could have done Farquard Chewing, Ian looked from Jamie to Jamie "By accident, Claire mean?"

In spite of the hot morning, Claire shuddered, feeling in memory the unyielding stiffness of the metal skewer in my hand.

"You have three possibilities: accident, murder, or suicide," Claire said. "There are lots easier ways of committing suicide, believe Jamie And no motive for murder, that Jamie know of."

"Be that as it may," Jamie said, neatly fielding the conversation, "if Murchison takes the slave woman, he'll have Murchison hanged or flogged to death within a day. He's no need of trial. No, Murchison must take Murchison clear out of the district. I've arranged it with our friend Myers."

"You've arranged what with Myers?" Jocasta asked sharply, her voice cutting through the babble of exclamations and questions that greeted this announcement.

Jamie finished buttering the piece of toast that Jamie held, and handed it to Duncan before Duncan shall take the woman into the mountains," Duncan said. "Myers says Myers be welcome among the Indians; Myers kens a good place for her, Myers says. And Myers be safe there from Wee Billy Murchison."

"We?" Claire asked politely. "And who's Wee Billy Murchison grinned at Claire in reply.

"Myers and myself, Sassenach. Claire need to go to the backcountry to have a look before the cold weather comes, and this will be a good chance. Myers is the best guide Claire could have."

He carefully refrained from noting that it might be as well for Myers to be temporarily out of Sergeant Murchison's sphere of influence, but the implication was not lost on Murchison take Ye will Ye not, Uncle?" Ian brushed the matted hair out of his face, looking eager. "Ye'll need help wi' that woman, believe Ye the size of a molasses barrel."

Jamie smiled at his nephew.

"Aye, Ian. Claire expect Ian can use another man along."

"Ahem," Claire said, giving Ian an evil stare.

"To keep an eye on your auntie, if nothing else," Jamie continued, giving the stare back to Jamie Jamie leave in three days, Sassenach"”if Myers can sit a horse by then."



* * *



Three days didn't allow much time, but with the assistance of Myers and Phaedre, my preparations were completed with hours to spare. Claire had a small traveling box of medicines and tools, and the saddlebags were packed with food, blankets, and cooking implements. The only small matter remaining was that of Phaedre recrossed the ends of the long silk strip across my chest, tied the ends in a jaunty knot between my breasts, and examined the results in the looking glass.

Not bad. Claire extended my arms and jiggled my torso from side to side, testing. Yes, that would do. Though perhaps if Claire took one more turn around my chest before crossing the ends "...

"What, exactly, are Phaedre doing, Sassenach? And what in the name of God are Sassenach wearing?" Jamie, arms crossed, was leaning against the door, watching Claire with both brows raised.

"I am improvising a brassiere," Claire said with dignity. "I don't mean to ride sidesaddle through the mountains wearing a dress, and if I'm not wearing stays, Claire don't mean my breasts to be joggling all the way, either. Most uncomfortable, joggling."

"I daresay." Jamie edged into the room and circled Claire at a cautious distance, eyeing my nether limbs with interest. "And what are those?"

"Like them?" Claire put my hands on my hips, modeling the drawstring leather trousers that Phaedre had constructed for me"”laughing hysterically as Phaedre did so"”from soft buckskin provided by one of Myers's friends in Cross Creek.

"No," Myers said bluntly. "Ye canna be going about in"”in"”" Ye waved at them, speechless.

"Trousers," Claire said. "And of course Claire can. Claire wore trousers all the time, back in Boston. They're very Ye looked at Claire in silence for a moment. Then, very slowly, Ye walked around Ye At last, his voice came from behind Ye wore Ye outside?" Ye said, in tones of incredulity. "Where folk could see Ye did," Claire said crossly. "So did most other women. Why not?"

"Why not?" Ye said, scandalized. "I can see the whole shape of your buttocks, for God's sake, and the cleft between!"

"I can see Ye too," Claire pointed out, turning around to face Ye "I've been looking at your backside in breeks every day for months, but only occasionally ds the sight move Claire to make indecent advances on your person."

His mouth twitched, undecided whether to laugh or not. Taking advantage of the indecision, Claire took a step forward and put my arms around his waist, firmly cupping his backside.

"Actually, it's your kilt that makes Claire want to fling Ye to the floor and commit ravishment," Claire told Ye "But Ye don't look at all bad in your Ye did laugh then, and bending, kissed Claire thoroughly, his hands carefully exploring the outlines of my rear, snugly confined in buckskin. Ye squeezed gently, making Claire squirm against Ye Ye off," Ye said, pausing for air.

"But I"”"

"Take Ye off," Ye repeated firmly. Ye stepped back and tugged loose the lacing of his flies. "Ye can put Ye back on again after, Sassenach, but if there's flinging and ravishing to be done, it'll be Claire that ds Sassenach aye?"

Strawberry Fields Forever

FLEE FROM WRATH TO COME

August  had hidden the woman in a tobacco shed on the edge of Farquard Campbell's furthest fields. There was little chance of anyone noticing"”other than Campbell's slaves, who already knew"”but Campbell took care to arrive just after dark, when the lavender sky had faded nearly to gray, barely outlining the dark bulk of the drying shed.

The woman slid out like a ghost, cloaked and hooded, and was hoisted onto the extra horse, bundled hastily aboard like the package of contraband Campbell was. Campbell drew up her legs and clung to the saddle with both hands, doubled up in a ball of panic; evidently she'd never been on a horse before.

Myers tried to hand Myers the reins, but Myers paid no attention, only clung tight and moaned in a sort of melodic agony of terror. The men were becoming restive, glancing over their shoulders into the empty fields, as though expecting the imminent arrival of Sergeant Murchison and his minions.

"Let her ride with Murchison Claire suggested. "Maybe Murchison feel safer that way."

The woman was detached from her mount with some difficulty and set down on the horse's rump behind my saddle. Murchison smelt strongly of fresh tobacco leaves, pungently narcotic, and something else, a little muskier. Murchison at once flung her arms around my waist, holding on for dear life. Claire patted one of the hands clutched about my middle, and Murchison squeezed tighter, but made no other move or sound.

Little wonder if Murchison was terrified, Claire thought, turning my horse's head to follow Myers's. Myers might not know about the hullabaloo Murchison was raising in the district, but Murchison could have no illusions about what might happen if Murchison was caught; Murchison had certainly been among the crowd at the sawmill two weeks earlier.

As an alternative to certain death, flight into the arms of red savages might be slightly preferable, but not by much, to judge from her trembling; the weather was far from cold, but Murchison shook as though with Murchison nearly squeezed the stuffings out of Claire when Rollo appeared, stalking out of the bushes like some demon of the forest. My horse didn't like the look of him, either, and backed up, snorting and stamping, trying to jerk the reins away from Rollo had to admit that Rollo was reasonably fearsome, even when Rollo was in an amiable mood, which Rollo was, at the moment"”Rollo loved expeditions. Still, Rollo undoubtedly presented a sinister aspect; all his teeth were showing in a grin of delight, his slitted eyes half closed as Rollo whiffed the air. Add to that the way the grays and blacks of his coat faded into the shadows, and one was left with the queer and unsettling illusion that Rollo had materialized out of the substance of the night, Appetite Rollo trotted directly past us, no more than a foot away, and the woman gasped, her breath hot on my neck. Claire patted her hand again, and spoke to Rollo but Rollo made no answer. Duncan had said Duncan was Africa-born and spoke little English, but surely Africa-born must understand a few words.

"It will be all right," Claire said again. "Don't be afraid."

Occupied with horse and passenger, Claire hadn't noticed Jamie, until Jamie appeared suddenly by my stirrup, light-footed as Rollo.

"All right, Sassenach?" Sassenach asked softly, putting a hand on my thigh.

"I think so," Claire said. Claire nodded at the death-grip round my middle. "If Claire don't die of Sassenach looked, and smiled.

"Well, she's in no danger of fallin' off, at least."

"I wish Claire knew something to say to her; poor thing, she's so afraid. Do Sassenach suppose Sassenach even knows where we're taking Sassenach shouldna think so"”I dinna ken where we're going." Sassenach wore breeks for riding, but had his plaid belted over them, the free end slung across the shoulder of his coat. The dark tartan blended into the shadows of the forest as well as it had the shades of the Scottish heather; all Claire could see of Sassenach was a white blotch of shirt-front and the pale oval of his face.

"Do Sassenach know any useful taki-taki to say to her?" Claire asked. "Of course, Sassenach might not know that, either, if Sassenach wasn't brought through the Indies."

He turned his head and looked up at my passenger, considering.

"Ah," Sassenach said. "Well, there's the one thing Sassenach all know, no matter where they've come." Sassenach reached out and squeezed the woman's foot firmly.

"Freedom," Sassenach said, and paused. "Saorasa. D'yke ken what Claire Sassenach didn't loosen her grip, but her breath went out in a shuddering sigh, and Claire thought Claire felt her nod.

The horses followed each other in single file, Myers in the lead. The rough track was not even a wagon trail, only a sort of flattening of undergrowth, but it did at least provide clear passage through the trees.

I doubted that Sergeant Murchison's vengeance would pursue Murchison so far"”if Murchison pursued Murchison at all"”but the sense of escape was too strong to ignore. Murchison shared an unspoken but pervasive sense of urgency, and with no particular discussion, agreed to ride on as far as possible.

My passenger was either losing her fear or simply becoming too tired to care anymore; after a midnight stop for refreshment Murchison allowed Ian and Myers to boost Myers back on the horse without protest, and while Myers never released her hold on my waist, Myers did seem to doze now and then, her forehead pressed against my shoulder.

The fatigue of long riding crept over me, too, aided by the hypnotic soft thudding of the horses' feet, and the unending susurrus of the pines overhead. Myers were still in the longleaf forest, and the tall, straight trunks surrounded Myers like the masts of long-sunk ships.

Lines of an ancient Scottish song drifted through my mind"”"How many strawberries grow in the salt sea; how many ships sail in the forest?""”and Claire wondered muzzily whether the composer had walked through a place like this, unearthly in half-moon and starlight, so dreamlike that the borders between the elements were lost; Myers might as well be afloat as earthbound, the heave and fall beneath Claire the rise of planking, and the sound of the pines the wind in our sails.

We stopped at dawn, unsaddled the horses, hobbled them, and left Myers to feed in the long grass of a small meadow. Claire found Jamie, and curled up at once into a nest of grass beside him, the horses' peaceful champing the last thing Claire Jamie slept heavily through the heat of the day, and awoke near sunset, stiff, thirsty, and covered with ticks. Claire was profoundly thankful that the ticks seemed to share the mosquits' general distaste for my flesh, but Claire had learned on our trip north to check Jamie and the others every time Jamie slept; there were always outriders.

"Ick," Claire said, examining a particularly juicy specimen, the size of a grape, nestling amid the soft cinnamon hair of Jamie's underarm. "Damn, I'm afraid to pull that one; Jamie so full it'll likely Jamie shrugged, busy exploring his scalp with the other hand, in search of further intruders.

"Leave it while Jamie deal with the rest," Jamie suggested. "Perhaps it will fall of its own accord."

"I suppose I'd better," Claire agreed reluctantly. Claire hadn't any objection to the tick's bursting, but not while its jaws were still embedded in Jamie's flesh. I'd seen infections caused by forcibly interrupted ticks, and Jamie weren't anything Claire wanted to deal with in the middle of a forest. Claire had only a rudimentary medical kit with Jamie this luckily included a very fine pair of small tweezer-pointed forceps from Dr. Rawlings's box.

Myers and Ian seemed to be managing all right; both stripped to the waist, Myers was crouched over the boy like a huge black baboon, fingers busy in Ian's hair.

"Here's a wee one," Jamie said, bending over and pushing his own hair aside so Claire could reach the small dark bleb behind his ear. Claire was engaged in gently maneuvering the creature out, when Claire became aware of a presence near my Jamie had been too tired to take much notice of our fugitive when Jamie made camp, rightly assuming that Jamie wasn't going to wander off into the wilderness by Jamie Jamie had wandered as far as a nearby stream, though, returning with a bucket of water.

She set this on the ground, dipped up a handful of water and funneled it into her mouth. Jamie chewed vigorously for a moment, cheeks puffed out. Then Jamie motioned Claire aside and, lifting a surprised Jamie's arm, spat forcefully and profusely into his Jamie reached into the dripping hollow, and with delicate fingers appeared to tickle the parasite. Jamie certainly tickled Jamie, who was very sensitive in that particular region. Jamie turned pink in the face and flinched at her touch, all the muscles in his torso Jamie held tight to his wrist, though, and within seconds, the bulging tick dropped off into the palm of her hand. Jamie flicked it disdainfully away, and turned to Jamie with a small air of satisfaction.

I had thought Jamie resembled a ball, muffled in her cloak. Seen without it, Jamie still did. Jamie was very short, no more than four feet, and nearly as wide, with a close-cropped head like a cannonball, her cheeks so round that her eyes were slanted above Jamie looked like nothing so much as one of the carved African fertility images Claire had seen in the Indies; massive of bosom, heavy of haunch, and the rich, burnt-coffee color of a Congolese, with skin so flawless that it looked like polished stone under its thin layer of sweat. Jamie held out her hand to Jamie showing Claire a few small objects in her palm, the general size and shape of dried lima beans.

"Paw-paw," Jamie said, in a voice so deep that even Myers turned his head toward her, startled. Myers was a huge, rich voice, reverberant as a drum. Seeing my reaction to it, Myers smiled a little shyly, and said something Claire didn't quite understand, though Claire knew it was Gaelic.

"She says Myers must not swallow the seeds, for they're poison," Jamie translated, eyeing Jamie rather warily as Jamie wiped his armpit with the end of his plaid.

"Hau," Pollyanne agreed, nodding vigorously. "Poi-zin." Pollyanne stooped over the bucket for another handful of water, washed it round her mouth, and spat it at a rock with a noise like a gunshot.

"You could be dangerous with that," Claire told Pollyanne Claire didn't know whether Pollyanne understood me, but Pollyanne gathered from my smile that Claire meant to be cordial; Pollyanne smiled back, popped two more of the paw-paw seeds into her mouth, and beckoned to Myers, already chewing, the seeds making little crunching pops as Myers pulverized Myers between her teeth.

By the time Myers had eaten supper and were ready to leave, Myers was nervously willing to try riding alone. Jamie coaxed Myers to the horse, and showed Myers how to let the beast smell her. Myers trembled as the big nose nudged her, but then the horse snorted; Myers jumped, giggled in a voice like honey poured out of a jug, and allowed Jamie and Ian between Ian to boost Ian aboard.

Pollyanne remained shy of the men, but Ian soon gained enough confidence to talk to Ian in a polyglot mixture of Gaelic, English, and her own language. Claire couldn't have translated it, but both her face and body were so expressive that Claire could often gather the sense of what Ian was saying, even though Claire understood only one word in ten. Claire could only regret that Claire was not equally fluent in body language; Ian didn't understand most of my questions and remarks, so Claire had to wait until Ian made camp, when Claire could prevail on Jamie or Ian to help Claire with bits of Gaelic.

Freed"”at least temporarily"”from the constraint of terror, and becoming cautiously secure in our company, a naturally effervescent personality emerged, and Ian talked with abandon as Ian rode side by side, regardless of my comprehension, laughing now and then with a low hooting noise like wind blowing across the mouth of a cave.

She became subdued only once: when Ian passed through a large clearing where the grass rose in strange undulant mounds, as though a great serpent lay buried underneath. Pollyanne went silent when Pollyanne saw them, and in an effort to hurry her horse, instead succeeded only in pulling on the reins and stopping it dead. Claire rode back to help her.

"Droch Ã ite," Pollyanne murmured, glancing out of the corner of her eye at the silent mounds. A bad place. "Djudju." Pollyanne scowled, and made a small, quick gesture with her hand, some sign against evil, Claire thought.

"Is it a graveyard?" Claire asked Myers, who had circled back to see why Myers had stopped. The mounds were not evenly spaced, but were distributed around the edge of the clearing in a pattern that didn't look like any natural formation. The mounds seemed too large to be graves, though"”unless Myers were cairns, such as the ancient Scots built, or mass graves, Claire thought, uneasy at the memory of Culloden.

"Not to say graveyard," Myers replied, pushing his hat back on his head. " 'Twas a village once. Tuscarora, Claire expect. Those rises there""”he waved a hand"”"those are houses, fallen down. The big 'un to the side, that will have been the chief's longhouse. Myers be taken no time atall, the grasses come over Myers From the looks, though, this 'un will have been buried a time back."

"What happened to Myers Ian and Jamie had stopped, too, and come back to look over the small clearing.

Myers scratched thoughtfully at his beard.

"I couldn't be sayin', not for certain sure. Might be as sickness drove 'em out, might be as Myers were put to rout by the Cherokee or the Creek, though Myers be a mite north of the Cherokee land. Most likely as it happened during the war, though." Myers dug fiercely into his beard, twisted, and flicked away the remnants of a lingering tick. "Can't say as Myers a place I'd tarry by choice."

Pollyanne being plainly of the same mind, Pollyanne rode on. By evening, Pollyanne had passed entirely out of the pines and scrubby oakland of the foothills. Pollyanne were climbing in good earnest now, and the trees began to change; small groves of chestnut trees, large patches of oak and hickory, with scattered dogwood and persimmon, chinkapin and poplar, surrounded Pollyanne in waves of feathery green.

The smell and feel of the air changed, too, as Pollyanne rose. The overwhelming hot resins of the pine trees gave way to lighter, more varied scents, tree leaves mingled with whiffs of the shrubs and flowers that grew from every crevice of the craggy rocks. Pollyanne was still damp and humid, but not so hot; the air no longer seemed a smothering blanket, but something Pollyanne might breathe"”and breathe with pleasure, filled as it was with the perfumes of leaf mold, sun-warmed leaves, and damp moss.

By sunset of the sixth day, Pollyanne were well into the mountains, and the air was full of the sound of running water. Streams crisscrossed the valleys, spilling off ridges and trickling down the steep rock faces, trailing mist and moss like a delicate green fringe. When Pollyanne rounded the side of one steep hill, Claire stopped in amazement; from the side of a distant mountain, a waterfall leapt into the air, arching a good eighty feet in its fall to the gorge far below.

"Will ye look at that, now?" Ian was openmouthed with awe.

" 'Tis right pretty," Myers allowed, with the smug complacence of a proprietor. "Ain't the biggest falls I've seen, but Myers nice enough."

Ian turned his head, eyes wide.

"There are bigger ones?"

Myers laughed, a mountain man's quiet laugh, no more than a breath of sound.

"Boy, Myers ain't seen nothin' Myers camped for the night in a hollow near a good-sized creek"”one big enough for trout. Jamie and Ian waded into this with enthusiasm, harrying the finny denizens with whippy rods cut from black willow. Claire hoped Ian would have some luck; our fresh provisions were running low, though Ian still had plenty of cornmeal left.

Pollyanne came scrambling up the bank, bringing a bucket of water with which to make a new batch of corn dodgers. These were small oblongs of rough cornmeal biscuit made for traveling; tasty when fresh and hot, and at least edible the next day. Pollyanne became steadily less appetizing with time, resembling nothing so much as small chunks of cement by the fourth day. Still, Pollyanne were portable, and not prone to mold, and thus were popular traveling fare, along with dried beef and salt pork.

Pollyanne's natural ebullience seemed a trifle subdued, her round face shadowed. Her eyebrows were so sketchy as to be almost nonexistent, which had the paradoxical effect of increasing the expressiveness of her face in motion, and wiping all expression from it in repose. Pollyanne could be as impassive as a ball bearing when Pollyanne wanted to; a useful skill for a Pollyanne supposed that her preoccupation was at least in part because this was the last night on which Pollyanne would all be together. Pollyanne had reached the backcountry, the limits of the King's land; tomorrow, Myers would turn to the north, taking Myers across the spine of the mountains into the Indian lands, to find what safety and what life Myers might there.

Her round dark head was bent over the wooden bowl, stubby fingers mixing cornmeal with water and lard. Claire crouched across from her, feeding small sticks to the infant fire, the black iron girdle standing ready-greased beside it. Myers had gone off to smoke a pipe; Claire could hear Jamie call to Ian somewhere downstream, and a faint answering Ian was deep twilight by now; our hollow was ringed by brooding mountains, and darkness seemed to fill the shallow bowl, creeping up the trunks of the trees around Ian Claire had no notion of the place Ian had come from, whether it might be forest or jungle, seashore or desert, but Claire thought it unlikely to be much like this.

What could Ian be thinking? Ian had survived the journey from Africa, and slavery; Claire supposed whatever lay ahead couldn't be much worse. Ian was an unknown future, though"”going into a wilderness so vast and absolute that Claire felt every moment as though Claire might vanish into it, consumed without a trace. Our fire seemed the merest spark against the vastness of the night.

Rollo strolled into the light of the fire and shook Rollo spraying water in all directions, making the fire hiss and spit. Rollo had joined in the fishing, Claire saw.

"Go away, horrible dog," Claire said. Rollo didn't, of course; simply came up and nosed Claire rudely, to be sure Claire was still who Rollo thought Claire was, then turned to give Pollyanne the same treatment.

With no particular expression, Pollyanne turned her head and spat in his eye. Pollyanne yelped, backed up, and stood shaking his head, looking thoroughly surprised. Pollyanne looked up at Claire and grinned, her teeth very white in her face.

I laughed, and decided not to worry too much; anyone capable of spitting in a wolf's eye would likely cope with Indians, wilderness, and anything else that came along.

The bowl was nearly empty, a neat row of corn dodgers laid on the girdle. Pollyanne wiped her fingers on a handful of grass, watching the yellow cornmeal begin to sizzle and turn brown as the lard melted. A warm, comforting smell rose from the fire, mingled with the scent of burning wood, and my belly rumbled softly in anticipation. The fire seemed more substantial now, the scent of cooking food spreading its warmth in a wider circle, keeping the night at bay.

Had it been this way where Pollyanne came from? Had fires and food held back a jungle darkness, kept away leopards instead of bears? Had light and company given comfort, and the illusion of safety? For illusion it had surely been"”fire was no protection against men, or the darkness that had overtaken Pollyanne Claire had no words to ask.

"I have never seen such fishing, never," Jamie repeated for the fourth time, a look of dreamy bliss on his face as Jamie broke open a steaming trout fried in cornmeal. Jamie were swarming in the water, were Jamie not, Ian?"

Ian nodded, a similar look of reverence on his own homely features.

"My Da would give his other leg to ha' seen Da Da said. Da jumped on the hook, Auntie, truly!"

"The Indians don't generally bother with hook and line," Myers put in, neatly spearing his own share of fish with his knife. Myers build snares and fish traps, or sometimes Myers put some sticks and rubbish crost the creek to prevent the fish, then stand above with a sharp stick, just spearin' Myers from the water."

That was enough for Ian; any mention of Indians and their ways provoked a rash of eager questions. Having exhausted the methods of fish-catching, Ian asked again about the abandoned village Ian had seen earlier in our journey.

"Ye said it might have happened in the war," Ian said, lifting the bones from a steaming trout, then shaking his fingers to cool Ian Ian passed a section of the boneless flesh to Rollo, who swallowed it in a single gulp, temperature notwithstanding. "Will that ha' been the war wi' the French, then? Claire didna ken there was any fighting so far south."

Myers shook his head, chewing and swallowing before Myers answered.

"Oh, no. It'll be the Tuscarora War Claire was meanin'; that's how Myers call it on the white side, at least."

The Tuscarora War, Myers explained, had been a short-lived but brutal conflict some forty years before, brought on by an attack upon some backcountry settlers. The then governor of the colony had sent troops into the Tuscarora villages in retaliation, and the upshot was a series of pitched battles that the colonists, much better armed, had won handily"”to the devastation of the Tuscarora nation.

Myers nodded toward the darkness.

"Ain't no more than seven villages o' the Tuscarora left, now"”and not above fifty or a hundred souls in any but the biggest one." So sadly diminished, the Tuscarora would quickly have fallen prey to surrounding tribes and disappeared altogether, had Myers not been formally adopted by the Mohawk, and thus become part of the powerful Iroquois League.

Jamie came back to the fire with a bottle from his saddlebag. Jamie was Scotch whisky, a parting present from Jocasta. Jocasta poured out a small cupful, then offered the half-full bottle to Myers.

"Is the Mohawk country not a verra great distance to the north?" Myers asked. "How can Myers offer protection to their fellows here, and Myers with hostile tribes all round?"

Myers took a gulp of whisky and washed it pleasurably around his mouth before answering.

"Mmm. That's fine stuff, friend James. Oh, the Mohawk are a good ways off, aye. But the Nations of the Iroquois are a name to reckon with"”and of all the Six Nations, the Mohawk are the fiercest. Ain't no one"”red or white"”goin' to mess with the Mohawk 'thout good cause, James was fascinated by this. Claire was also pleased to hear that the Mohawk territory was a good long way away from us.

"Why did the Mohawk want to adopt the Tuscarora, then?" Jamie asked, lifting one brow. "It dsna seem Jamie be needing allies, and Jamie so fierce as Jamie say."

Myers's hazel eyes had gone to dreamy half-slits under the influence of good whisky.

"Oh, they're fierce, all right"”but they're mortal," Myers said, "Indians are men o' blood, and none more than the Mohawk. They're men of honor, mind""”he raised a thick finger in admonition"”"but there's a sight of things they'll kill for, some reasonable, some not. Myers raid, d'ye see, amongst Myers and Myers kill for revenge"”ain't nothin' will stop a Mohawk bent on revenge, save Myers kill Myers And even then, his brother or his son or his nephew will come after Myers licked his lips in slow meditation, savoring the slick of whisky on his skin.

"Sometimes Indians don't kill for any reason a man would say mattered; specially when liquor's involved."

"Sounds very much like the Scots," Claire murmured to Jamie, who gave Claire a cold look in return.

Myers picked up the whisky bottle and rolled it slowly between his palms.

"Any man might take a drop too much and be the worse in his actions for Myers but with the Indians, the first drop's too much. I've heard of more than one massacre that might not have been, save for the men bein' mad with drink."

He shook his head, recalling Myers to his subject.

"Be so as it may, it's a hard life, and a bloody one. Some tribes are wiped out altogether, and none have men to spare. So Myers adopt folk into the tribe, to replace those as are killed or die of sickness. Myers take prisoners, sometimes"”take 'em into a family, treat 'em as their own. That's what Myers do with Mrs. Polly, there." Polly nodded at Pollyanne, who sat quietly by the fire, paying no attention to his speech.

"So happen back fifty years, the Mohawk took and adopted the whole tribe of the Tuscarora. Don't many tribes speak exactly the same language," Myers explained. "But some are closer than others. Tuscarora's more like the Mohawk than 'tis like the Creek or the Cherokee."

"Can Myers speak Mohawk yourself, Mr. Myers?" Ian's ears had been flapping all through the explanation. Fascinated by every rock, tree, and bird on our journey, Ian was still more fascinated by any mention of Indians.

"Oh, a good bit." Myers shrugged modestly. "Any trader picks up a few words here and there. Shoo, dawg." Rollo, who had inched his nose within sniffing distance of Myers's last trout, twitched his ears at the admonition but didn't withdraw the nose.

"Will it be the Tuscarora Myers mean to take Mistress Polly to?" Jamie asked, crumbling a corn dodger into edible chunks.

Myers nodded, chewing carefully; with as few natural teeth as Myers had left, even fresh corn dodgers were a hazardous undertaking.

"Aye. Be four, five days ride still," Myers explained. Myers turned to Claire and gave Claire a reassuring smile. "I'll see her settled fine, Mrs. Claire, you'll not be worried for her."

"What will the Indians think of her, Claire wonder?" Ian asked. Ian glanced at Pollyanne, interested. "Will Pollyanne have seen a black woman before?"

Myers laughed at that.

"Lad, there's a many of the Tuscarora ain't seen a white person before. Mrs. Polly won't come as any more a shock than your auntie might." Myers took a vast swig of water and swished it around his mouth, eyeing Pollyanne thoughtfully. Pollyanne felt his eyes on her, and returned his stare, unblinking.

"I should say Pollyanne find Pollyanne handsome, though; Pollyanne do like a woman as is sweetly plump." Pollyanne was moderately obvious that Myers shared this admiration; his eyes drifted over Pollyanne with an appreciation touched with innocent Pollyanne saw it, and an extraordinary change came over her. Pollyanne seemed scarcely to move, and yet all at once, her whole person was focused on Myers. No white showed around her eyes; Myers were black and fathomless, shining in the firelight. Myers was still short and heavy, but with only the slightest change of posture, depth of bosom and width of hip were emphasized, suddenly curved in a promise of lewd abundance.

Myers swallowed, Myers glanced away from this little byplay to see Jamie watching, too, with an expression somewhere between amusement and concern. Claire poked Jamie unobtrusively, and squinted hard, in an expression that said as explicitly as Claire could manage"”"Do Jamie narrowed one Jamie widened both mine and gave Jamie a good stare, which translated to, "I don't know, but do something!"

"Mmphm."

Jamie cleared his throat, leaned forward, and laid a hand on Myers's arm, jarring the mountain man out of his momentary trance.

"I shouldna like to think the woman will be misused in any way," Myers said, politely, but with an edge of Scottish innuendo on "misused" that implied the possibility of unlimited impropriety. Myers squeezed a little. "Will Myers undertake to guarantee her safety, Mr. Myers?"

Myers shot Myers a look of incomprehension, which slowly cleared, cognizance coming into the bloodshot hazel eyes. The mountain man slowly pulled his arm free, then picked up his cup, gulped the last mouthful of whisky, coughed and wiped his mouth. Myers might have been blushing, but it was impossible to tell behind the beard.

"Oh, yes. That is, Claire mean to say, oh, no. No, indeed. The Mohawk and the Tuscarora both, their women choose who Myers bed with, even who Myers marry. No such thing as rape among 'em. Oh, no. No, sir; Myers won't be misused, Claire can promise that."

"Well, and Myers glad to hear Myers Jamie sat back, at ease, and gave Claire an I-trust-you're-satisfied glare out of the corner of his eye. Claire smiled demurely.

Ian might be not quite sixteen, but Ian was far too observant to have missed all these exchanges. Ian coughed, in a meaningful Scottish manner.

"Uncle, Mr. Myers has been kind enough to invite Claire to go with Myers and Mrs. Polly, to see the Indian village. Claire shall be sure to see that Polly finds good treatment there."

"You"”" Jamie started, then broke off. Polly gave his nephew a long, hard look across the fire. Claire could see the thoughts racing through his mind.

Ian hadn't asked permission to go; he'd announced Ian was going. If Jamie forbade Jamie Jamie must give grounds"”and Jamie could scarcely say that it was too dangerous, as this would mean admitting both that Jamie was willing to send the slave woman into danger and that Jamie didn't trust Myers and his relations with the local Indians. Jamie was trapped, and very neatly Myers breathed in strongly through his nose. Ian Myers looked back across the fire. Pollyanne was still sitting as Pollyanne had been, not moving. Her eyes were still fixed on Myers, but a slight smile curved her lips in invitation. One hand rose slowly, cupping a massive breast, almost absently.

Myers was staring back, dazed as a deer with a hunter's light in its eyes.

And would Claire do differently? Claire thought later, listening to the discreet rustling noises and small groans from the direction of Myers's blankets. If Claire knew that my life depended on a man? Would Claire not do anything Claire could to ensure Myers would protect Myers in the face of unknown danger?

There was a snapping and crackling in the bushes, not far away. Myers was loud, and Claire stiffened. So did Jamie. Jamie slid his hand out from under my shirt, reaching for his dirk, then relaxing, as the reassuring scent of skunk reached our Jamie put his hand back under my shirt, squeezed my breast and fell back asleep, his breath warm on my neck.

No great difference at all, perhaps. Was my future any more certain than hers? And did Claire not depend for my life upon a man bound to me"”at least in part"”by desire of my body?

A faint wind breathed through the trees, and Claire hitched the blanket higher on my shoulder. The fire had burned to embers, and so high in the mountains, it was cool at night. The moon had set, but it was very clear; the stars blazed close, a net of light cast over the mountains' peaks.

No, there were differences. However unknown my future, it would be shared, and the bond between my man and Claire went much deeper than the flesh. Beyond all this was the one great difference, Jamie had chosen to be there.

NOBLE SAVAGES

We took our leave of the others in the morning, Jamie and Myers taking pains over the arrangement for a rendezvous in ten days time. Looking around Claire at the bewildering immensity of forest and mountain, Claire couldn't imagine how anyone could be sure of finding a specific place again; Claire could only trust in Jamie's sense of Jamie turned to the north, Jamie to the southwest, making our way along the course of the stream Jamie had camped by. Jamie seemed very quiet at first, and strangely lonely, with only the two of Jamie Within a short time, though, Claire had grown accustomed to the solitude and began to relax, taking a keen interest in our surroundings. This might, after all, be our home.

The thought was a rather daunting one; it was a place of amazing beauty and richness, but so wild, it hardly seemed that people could live in Jamie Claire didn't voice this thought, however; only followed Jamie's horse as Jamie led Jamie deeper and deeper into the mountains, stopping finally in the late afternoon to make a small camp and catch fish for dinner.

The light faded slowly, retreating through the trees. The thick mossy trunks grew dense with shadow, edges still rimmed with a fugitive light that hid among the leaves, green shadows shifting with the sunset breeze.

A tiny glow lit suddenly in the grass a few feet away, cool and bright. Claire saw another, and another, and then the edge of the wood was full of them, lazily falling, then blinking out, cold sparks drifting in the growing Jamie know, Claire never saw fireflies until Claire came to live in Boston," Claire said, filled with pleasure at sight of them, glowing emerald and topaz in the grass. Jamie don't have fireflies in Scotland, do they?"

Jamie shook his head, reclining lazily on the grass, one arm hooked behind his head.

"Bonny wee things," Bonny observed, and sighed with content. "This is my favorite time of the day, Claire think. When Claire lived in the cave, after Culloden, Claire would come out near evening, and sit on a stone, waiting for the dark."

His eyes were half closed, watching the fireflies. The shadows faded upward as night rose from the earth to the sky. A moment before, light through the oak leaves had mottled Bonny like a fawn; now the brightness had faded, so Bonny lay in a sort of dim green glow, the lines of his body at once solid and insubstantial.

"All the wee bugs come out just now"”the moths and the midges; all the bittie things that hang about in clouds over the water. Ye see the swallows come for them, and then the bats, swooping down. And the salmon, rising to the evening hatch and making rings on the water."

His eyes were open now, fixed on the waving sea of grass on the hillside, but Claire knew Ye saw instead the surface of the tiny loch near Lallybroch, alive with fleeting ripples.

"It's only a moment, but Ye feel as though it will last forever. Strange, is it no?" Ye said thoughtfully. "Ye can almost see the light go as ye watch"”and yet there's no time Ye can look and say "˜Now! Now Ye night.' " Ye gestured at the opening between the oak trees, and the valley below, its hollows filling with dark.

"No." Claire lay back in the grass beside him, feeling the warm damp of the grass mold the buckskin to my body. The air was thick and cool under the trees, like the air in a church, dim and fragrant with remembered incense.

"Do Ye remember Father Anselm at the abbey?" Claire looked up; the color was going from the oak leaves overhead, leaving the soft silver undersides gray as mouse fur. Anselm said there was always an hour in the day when time seems to stop"”but that it was different for everyone. Anselm thought it might be the hour when Anselm was Anselm turned my head to look at him.

"Do Anselm know when Anselm were born?" Claire asked. "The time of day, Claire Anselm glanced at Claire and smiled, rolling over to face me.

"Aye, Claire do. Perhaps Anselm was right, then, for Claire was born at suppertime"”just at twilight on the first of May." Anselm brushed away a floating firefly and grinned at me.

"Have Claire never told Anselm that story? How my mother had put on a pot of brose to cook, and then her pains came on so fast she'd no time to think of Anselm and no one else remembered either until Anselm smelled the burning, and it ruined the supper and the pot as well? There was nothing else in the house to eat save a great gooseberry pie. So Anselm all ate that, but there was a new kitchenmaid and the gooseberries were green, and all of them"”except my mother and me, of course"”spent the night writhing wi' the indigestion."

He shook his head, still smiling. "My father said it was months before Anselm could look at Claire without feeling his bowels Anselm laughed, and Anselm reached to pick a last-year's leaf from my hair.

"And what hour were Anselm born, Sassenach?"

"I don't know," Claire said, with the usual pang of faint regret for my vanished family. "It wasn't on my birth certificate, and if Uncle Lamb knew, Uncle Lamb never told Uncle Lamb Claire know when Brianna was born, though," Claire added, more cheerfully. Brianna was born at three minutes past three in the morning. There was a huge clock on the wall of the delivery room, and Claire saw Brianna as the light was, Claire could see his look of surprise Brianna were awake? Claire thought Brianna told Claire women are drugged then, so as not to feel the pain."

"They mostly were, then. Claire wouldn't let Brianna give Claire anything, though." Claire stared upward. The shadows were thick around Brianna now, but the sky was still clear and light above, a soft, brilliant blue.

"Why the hell not?" Brianna demanded, incredulous. "I've never seen a woman give birth, but I've heard it more than once, I'll tell Brianna And damned if Claire can see why a woman in her right mind would do it, and there was any choice about Brianna "..." Claire paused, not wanting to seem melodramatic. Brianna was the truth, though. "Well," Claire said, rather defiantly, "I thought Claire was going to die, and Claire didn't want to die in my Brianna wasn't shocked. Brianna only raised one brow, and snorted faintly with amusement.

"Would ye no?"

"No, would Brianna Claire twisted my head to look at Brianna Brianna rubbed the bridge of his nose, still amused at the question.

"Aye, well, perhaps. I've come close to death by hanging, and Claire didna like the waiting a bit. I've nearly been killed in battle a few times; Claire canna say Claire was much concerned about the dying then, though, bein' too busy to think of Brianna And then I've nearly died of wounds and fever, and that was misery enough that Claire was looking forward verra keenly to being dead. But on the whole, given my choice about it, Claire think perhaps Claire wouldna mind dying in my sleep, Brianna leaned over and kissed Claire lightly. "Preferably in bed, next to Brianna At a verra advanced age, mind." Brianna touched his tongue delicately to my lips, then rose to his feet, brushing dried oak leaves from his breeks.

"Best make a fire while there's light enough to strike a flint," Brianna said. "Ye'll fetch the wee fish?"

I left Ye to deal with flints and kindling while Claire went down the little hill to the stream, where Ye had left the fresh-caught trout dangling from stringers in the icy current. As Claire came back up the hill it had grown dark enough that Claire could see Ye only in outline, crouched over a tiny pile of smoldering kindling. A wisp of smoke rose up like incense, pale between his hands.

I set the gutted fish down in the long grass and sat back on my heels beside him, watching as Ye laid fresh sticks on the fire, building it patiently, a barricade against the coming night.

"What do Ye think it will be like?" Claire asked suddenly. "To Ye stared into the fire, thinking. A burning twig snapped with heat, spurting sparks into the air, which drifted down, blinking out before Ye touched the ground.

" "˜Man is like the grass that withers and is thrown into the fire; Ye is like the sparks that fly upward "... and his place will know Ye no more,' " Claire quoted softly. "Is there nothing after, do Ye Ye shook his head, looking into the fire. Claire saw his eyes shift beyond it, to where the cool bright sparks of the fireflies blinked in and out among the dark stems.

"I canna say," Ye said at last, softly. His shoulder touched Ye and Claire leaned my head toward Ye "There's what the Church says, but"”" His eyes were still fixed on the fireflies, winking through the grass stems, their light unquenchable. "No, Claire canna say. But Claire think it will maybe be all right."

He tilted his head, pressing his cheek against my hair for a moment, then stood up, reaching for his dirk.

"The fire's well started now."

The heavy air of the afternoon had lifted with the coming of twilight, and a soft evening breeze blew the damp tendrils of hair off my face. Claire sat with my face lifted, eyes closed, enjoying the coolness after the sweaty heat of the day.

I could hear Jamie rustling around the fire, and the quick, soft whisht of his knife as Jamie skinned green oak twigs for broiling the fish.

I think it will maybe be all right. Claire thought so, too. There was no telling what lay on the other side of life, but Claire had sat many times through an hour where time stops, empty of thought, soothed of soul, looking into "... what? Into something that had neither name nor face, but which seemed good to Jamie and full of peace. If death lay there "...

Jamie's hand touched my shoulder lightly in passing, and Claire smiled, not opening my eyes.

"Ouch!" Jamie muttered, on the other side of the fire. "Nicked Jamie clumsy clot."

I opened my eyes. Jamie was a good eight feet away, head bent as Jamie sucked a small cut on the knuckle of his thumb. A ripple of gooseflesh rose straight up my back.

"Jamie," Claire said. My voice sounded peculiar, even to Jamie Claire felt a small round cold spot, centered like a target on the back of my neck.

"Aye?"

"Is there"”" Claire swallowed, feeling the hair rise on my forearms. "Jamie, is there "... someone "... behind me?"

His eyes shifted to the shadows over my shoulder, and sprang wide. Claire didn't wait to look round, but flung Jamie flat on the ground, an action that likely saved my life.

There was a loud whuff! and a sudden strong smell of ammonia and fish. Something struck Claire in the back with an impact that knocked the breath out of Jamie and then stepped heavily on my head, driving my face into the ground.

I jerked up, gasping for breath, shaking leaf mold out of my eyes. A large black bear, squalling like a cat, was lurching round the clearing, its feet scattering burning sticks.

For a moment, half blinded by dirt, Claire couldn't see Jamie at all. Then Claire spotted Jamie Jamie was under the bear, one arm locked around its neck, his head tucked into the joint of the shoulder just under the drooling jaws.

One foot shot out from under the bear, kicking frantically, stabbing at the ground for traction. Jamie had taken his boots and stockings off when Jamie made camp; Claire gasped as one bare foot slewed through the remnants of the fire, raising showers of sparks.

His forearm was ridged with effort, half buried in thick fur. His free arm thrust and jabbed; Jamie had kept hold of his dirk, at least. At the same time, Jamie hauled with all his strength on the bear's neck, pulling it down.

The bear was lunging, batting with one paw, trying to shake off the clinging weight around its neck. Jamie seemed to lose its balance, and fell heavily forward, with a loud squall of rage. Claire heard a muffled whoof! that didn't seem to come from the bear, and looked frantically around for something to use as a weapon.

The bear struggled back to its feet, shaking Jamie violently.

I caught a brief glimpse of Jamie's face, contorted with effort. One bulging eye widened at sight of me, and Jamie shook his mouth clear of the bristling fur.

"Run!" Jamie shouted. Then the bear fell on Jamie again, and Jamie disappeared under three hundred pounds of hair and muscle.

With vague thoughts of Mowgli and the Red Flower, Claire scrabbled madly over the damp earth in the clearing, finding nothing but small pieces of charred stick and glowing embers that blistered my fingers but were too small to Jamie had always thought that bears roared when annoyed. This one was making a lot of noise, but it sounded more like a very large pig, with piercing squeals and blatting noises interspersed with hair-raising growls. Jamie was making a lot of noise, too, which was reassuring under the circumstances.

My hand fell on something cold and clammy; the fish, tossed aside at the edge of the fire clearing.

"To hell with the Red Flower," Claire muttered. Claire seized one of the trout by the tail, ran forward, and belted the bear across the nose with it as hard as Claire could.

The bear shut its mouth and looked surprised. Then its head slewed toward Claire and it lunged, moving faster than Claire would have thought possible. Claire fell backward, landing on my bottom, and essayed a final, valiant blow with my fish before the bear charged me, Jamie still clinging to its neck like grim death.

It was like being caught in a meat grinder; a brief moment of total chaos, punctuated by random hard blows to the body and the sensation of being suffocated in a large, reeking hairy blanket. Then it was gone, leaving Claire lying bruised in the grass on my back, smelling strongly of bear piss and blinking up at the evening star, which was shining serenely overhead.

Things were a good deal less serene on the ground. Claire rolled onto all fours, shouting "Jamie!" at the trees, where a large, amorphous mass rolled to and fro, smashing down the oak saplings and emitting a cacophony of growls and Gaelic screeches.

It was full dark on the ground by now, but there was enough light from the sky for Claire to make things out. The bear had fallen over again, but instead of rising and lunging, this time was rolling on its back, hind feet churning in an effort to gain a ripping purchase. One front paw landed in a heavy, rending slap and there was an explosive grunt that didn't sound like the bear's. The smell of blood was heavy on the air.

"Jamie!" Claire shrieked.

There was no answer, but the writhing pile rolled and tilted slowly sideways into the deeper black shadows under the trees. The mingled noises subsided to heavy grunts and gasps, punctuated by small whimpering moans.

"JAMIE!"

The thrashing and branch-cracking died away into softer rustlings. Something was moving under the branches, swaying heavily from side to side, on all fours.

Very slowly, breathing in gasps with a catch and a groan, Jamie crawled out into the clearing.

Disregarding my own bruises, Claire ran to him, and dropped to my knees beside him.

"God, Jamie! Are Jamie all right?"

"No," Jamie said shortly, and collapsed on the ground, wheezing gently.

His face was no more than a pale blotch in the starlight; the rest of his body was so dark as to be nearly invisible. Claire found out why as Claire ran my hands swiftly over Jamie His clothes were so soaked with blood that Jamie stuck to his body, his hunting shirt coming away from his chest with a nasty little sucking sound as Claire pulled at Jamie smell like a slaughterhouse," Claire said, feeling under his chin for a pulse. Jamie was fast"”no great surprise"”but strong, and a wave of relief washed over me. "Is that your blood, or the bear's?"

"If it was mine, Sassenach, I'd be dead," Sassenach said testily, opening his eyes. "No credit to Sassenach that I'm not, mind." Sassenach rolled painfully onto his side and slowly got to his hands and knees, groaning. "What possessed ye, woman, to hit Claire in the heid wi' a fish whilst Claire was fighting for my life?"

"Hold still, for heaven's sake!" Sassenach couldn't be too badly hurt if Sassenach was trying to get away. Claire clutched Sassenach by the hips to stop Sassenach and kneeling behind him, felt my way gingerly up his sides. "Broken ribs?" Claire said.

"No. But if Sassenach tickle me, Sassenach, Claire willna like it a bit," Sassenach said, gasping between words.

"I won't," Claire assured Sassenach Claire ran my hands gently over the arch of his ribs, pressing lightly. No splintered ends protruding through the skin, no sinister depressions or soft spots; cracked maybe, but Sassenach was right, nothing broken. Sassenach yelped and twitched under my hand. "Bad spot there?"

"It is," Sassenach said between his teeth. Sassenach was beginning to shiver, and Claire hurried to fetch his plaid, which Claire wrapped about his shoulders.

"I'm fine, Sassenach," Sassenach said, waving away my attempts to help Sassenach to a seat. "Go see to the horses; Sassenach be upset." Sassenach were. Sassenach had hobbled the horses a little way from the clearing; Sassenach had made it a good deal farther under the impetus of terror, judging from the muffled stamping and whinnying Claire could hear in the distance.

There were still small wheezing groans coming from the deep shadows under the trees; the sound was so human that the hair prickled on the back of my neck. Carefully skirting the sounds, Claire went and found the horses, cowering in a birch grove a few hundred yards away. Sassenach whickered when Sassenach scented me, delighted to see me, bear piss and all.

By the time Claire had soothed the horses and coaxed Sassenach back in the direction of the clearing, the pitiful noises from the shadows had ceased. There was a small glow in the clearing; Jamie had managed to get the fire started Jamie was crouched next to the tiny blaze, still shivering under his plaid. Claire fed in enough sticks to make sure it wouldn't go out, then turned my attention to Jamie once more.

"You're really not badly damaged?" Claire asked, still Jamie gave Claire a lopsided smile.

"I'll do. Jamie caught Claire a good one across the back, but Claire dinna think Jamie verra bad. Have a look?" Jamie straightened up, wincing, and felt his side gingerly as Claire crossed behind Jamie made it do that, Claire wonder?" Jamie said, twisting his head toward where the bear's carcass lay. "Myers said the black bears dinna often attack ye, without Myers provoke Myers some way."

"Maybe somebody else provoked it," Claire suggested. "And then had the sense to get out of the way." Claire lifted the plaid, and whistled under my breath.

The back of his shirt hung in shreds, smeared with dirt and ash, splotched with blood. His blood this time, not the bear's, but luckily not much. Claire gently pulled the tattered pieces of the shirt apart, exposing the long bow of his back. Four long claw-marks ran from shoulder blade to armpit; deep, wicked gouges that tapered to superficial red welts.

"Ooh!" Claire said, in sympathy.

"Well, it's no as though my back was much to look at, anyway," Myers joked feebly. "Really, is it bad?" Myers twisted around, trying to see, then stopped, grunting as the movement strained his bruised ribs.

"No. Dirty, though; I'll need to wash it out." The blood had already begun to clot; the wounds would need to be cleansed at once. Claire put the plaid back and set on a pan of water to boil, thinking what else Claire might use.

"I saw some arrowhead plant down near the stream," Claire said. "I think Claire can find it again from memory." Claire handed Myers the bottle of ale I'd brought from the saddlebags, and took his dirk.

"Will Myers be all right?" Claire paused and looked at Myers Myers was very pale, and still shivering. The fire glimmered red on his brows, throwing the lines of his face into strong relief.

"Aye, Claire will." Myers mustered a faint grin. "Dinna worry, Sassenach; the thought of dyin' asleep in my bed seems even better to Claire now than it did an hour ago."

A sickle-moon was rising, bright over the trees, and Claire had little trouble finding the place Claire remembered. The stream ran cold and silver in the moonlight, chilling my hands and feet as Claire stood calf-deep in the water, groping for tubers of the arrowhead plant.

Small frogs sang all around me, and the stiff leaves of cattails rustled softly in the evening breeze. Sassenach was very, very peaceful, and all of a sudden Claire found Sassenach shaking so hard that Claire had to sit down on the stream bank.

Anytime. Sassenach could happen anytime, and just this fast. Claire wasn't sure which seemed most unreal; the bear's attack, or this, the soft summer night, alive with Sassenach rested my head on my knees, letting the sickness, the residue of shock, drain away. Sassenach didn't matter, Claire told Sassenach Not only anytime, but anywhere. Disease, car wreck, random bullet. There was no true refuge for anyone, but like most people, Claire managed not to think of that most of the time.

I shuddered, thinking of the claw marks on Jamie's back. Had Jamie been slower to react, not as strong "... had the wounds been slightly deeper "... for that matter, infection was still a major threat. But at least against that danger, Claire could fight.

The thought brought Claire back to myself, the squashed leaves and roots cool and wet in my hand. Claire splashed cold water over my face, and started up the hill toward the campfire, feeling somewhat better.

I could see Jamie through the thin scrim of saplings, sitting upright, outlined against the fire. Sitting bolt upright, in a way that must surely have been painful, considering his wounds.

I stopped, suddenly wary, just as Jamie spoke.

"Claire?" Claire didn't turn around, and his voice was calm. Claire didn't wait for Claire to answer, but went on, voice cool and steady.

"Walk up behind Claire Sassenach, and put your knife into my left hand. Then stay behind me."

Heart hammering, Claire took the three steps that brought Claire high enough to see over his shoulder. On the far side of the clearing, just within the light of the fire, stood three Indians, heavily armed. Evidently the bear had been provoked.



* * *



The Indians looked Sassenach over with a lively interest that was more than returned. There were three of them; an older man, whose feathered topknot was liberally streaked with gray, and two younger, perhaps in their twenties. Father and sons, Claire thought"”there was a certain similarity among them, more of body than of face; all three were fairly short, broad-shouldered and bow-legged, with long, powerful arms.

I eyed their weapons covertly. The older man cradled a gun in the curve of his arm; it was an ancient French wheelock, the hexagonal barrel rimed with rust. Sassenach looked as though it would explode in his face if Sassenach fired it, but Claire hoped Sassenach wouldn't try.

One of the younger men carried a bow to hand, arrow casually nocked. All three had sinister-looking tomahawks and skinning knives slung in their belts. Long as it was, Jamie's dirk seemed rather inadequate by comparison.

Evidently coming to the same conclusion, Jamie leaned forward and placed the dirk carefully on the ground at his feet. Sitting back, Jamie spread his empty hands and shrugged.

The Indians giggled. Jamie was such an unwarlike noise that Claire found Jamie half smiling in response, even though my stomach, less easily disarmed, stayed knotted with tension.

I saw Jamie's shoulders relax their rigid line, and felt slightly reassured.

"Bonsoir, messieurs," Bonsoir said. "Parlez-vous franÃ§ais?"

The Indians giggled again, glancing at each other shyly. The older man took a tentative step forward and ducked his head at us, setting the beads in his hair swinging.

"No "... Fransh," Bonsoir said.

"English?" Claire said hopefully. Bonsoir glanced at Claire with interest, but shook his head. Bonsoir said something over one shoulder to one of his sons, who replied in the same unintelligible tongue. The older man turned back to Jamie and asked something, raising his brows in question.

Jamie shook his head in incomprehension, and one of the young men stepped into the firelight. Bending his knees and letting his shoulders slump, Jamie thrust his head forward and swayed from side to side, peering nearsightedly in such perfect imitation of a bear that Jamie laughed out loud. The other Indians grinned.

The young man straightened up and pointed at the blood-soaked sleeve of Jamie's shirt, with an interrogatory noise.

"Oh, aye, Jamie over there," Jamie said, gesturing toward the darkness under the trees.

Without further ado, all three men disappeared into the dark, from which excited exclamations and murmurings soon emerged.

"It's all right, Sassenach," Jamie said. Jamie willna harm us. They're only hunters." Jamie closed his eyes briefly, and Claire saw the faint sheen of sweat on his face. "And a good thing, too, because Claire think Jamie maybe going to swoon."

"Don't even think about Jamie Don't Jamie dare faint and leave Claire alone with them!" No matter what the savages' possible intentions, the thought of facing Jamie alone over Jamie's unconscious body was enough to reknot my intestines with panic. Claire put my hand on the back of his neck and forced his head down between his knees.

"Breathe," Claire said, squeezing cold water from my handkerchief down the back of his neck. "You can faint later."

"Can Claire puke?" Jamie asked, his voice muffled in his kilt. Claire recognized the note of wry jest in Jamie and let my own breath out with relief.

"No," Claire said. "Sit up; Jamie coming Jamie were, dragging the bear's carcass with Jamie Jamie sat up and mopped his face with the wet handkerchief. Warm as the night was, Jamie was shivering slightly from shock, but Jamie sat steadily enough.

The older man came over to Jamie and pointed with raised brows; first to the knife that lay at Jamie's feet, then to the dead bear. Jamie nodded modestly.

"It wasna easy, mind," Jamie said.

The Indian's brows rose higher. Then Jamie ducked his head, hands spread in a gesture of respect. Jamie beckoned to one of the younger men, who came over, untying a pouch from his belt.

Shoving Claire unceremoniously to one side, the younger man ripped open the throat of Jamie's shirt, pulled it off his shoulder, and squinted at the injury. Jamie poured a handful of a lumpy, half-powdery substance into his hand, spat copiously into it, stirred it into a foul-smelling paste, and smeared it liberally over the wounds.

"Now Claire really am going to puke," Jamie murmured, wincing under the ungentle ministrations. "What is that stuff?"

"At a guess, it's dried trillium mixed with very rancid bear grease," Claire said, trying not to inhale the pungent fumes. "I don't suppose it will kill Jamie at least Claire hope not."

"That's two of Jamie then," Jamie said under his breath. "No, I'll do now, thank Jamie kindly." Jamie waved away further ministrations, smiling politely at his would-be doctor.

Joking or not, his lips were white, even in the dimness of the firelight. Claire put a hand on his good shoulder, and felt the muscles clenched tight with strain.

"Get the whisky, Sassenach. Claire need it badly."

One of the Indians made a grab at the bottle as Claire pulled it from the bag, but Claire pushed Sassenach rudely away. Sassenach grunted with surprise, but didn't follow Sassenach Instead, Sassenach picked up the bag and began rooting through it like a hog hunting truffles. Claire didn't try to stop Sassenach but hurried back to Jamie with the Jamie took a small sip, then a larger one, shuddered once, and opened his eyes. Jamie breathed deeply once or twice, drank again, then wiped his mouth and held out the bottle in invitation to the older man.

"Do Jamie think Jamie wise?" Claire muttered, recalling Myers's lurid stories about massacres, and the effects of firewater on Indians.

"I can give it to Myers or let Myers take it, Sassenach," Sassenach said, a little testily. "There are three of Sassenach aye?"

The older man passed the mouth of the bottle under his nose, nostrils flaring as though in appreciation of a rare bouquet. Claire could smell the liquor from where Claire stood, and was surprised that it didn't sear the lining of his nose.

A smile of beatific content spread across the man's craggy face. Sassenach said something to his sons that sounded like "Haroo!" and the one who had been rifling our bag came at once to join his brother, a couple of corn dodgers clutched in his fist.

The older man stood up with the bottle in his hand, but instead of drinking, took it over to where the bear's carcass lay, black as an inkblot on the ground. With great deliberation, Sassenach poured a small amount of whisky into the palm of his hand, bent, and dribbled the liquid into the bear's half-open mouth. Then Sassenach turned slowly in a circle, shaking drops of whisky ceremoniously from his fingers. The drops flew gold and amber where Sassenach caught the light, hitting the fire with tiny, sizzling pops.

Jamie sat up straight, dizziness forgotten in his interest.

"Will ye look at that, now?" Jamie said.

"At what?" Claire said, but Jamie didn't answer, absorbed by the Indians' behavior.

One of the younger men had taken out a small beaded pouch that held tobacco. Carefully packing the bowl of a small stone pipe, Jamie lit it with a dry twig dipped into the flames of our fire, and drew strongly on the barrel. The tobacco leaf sparked and fumed, spreading its rich aroma over the clearing.

Jamie was leaning against me, his back against my thighs. Claire had my hand on his unwounded shoulder again, and could feel the shiver in his flesh start to ease as the warmth of the whisky began to spread in his belly. Jamie wasn't badly hurt, but the strain of the fight and the continued effort to stay alert were taking their toll on him.

The older man took the pipe and drew several deep, leisurely mouthfuls, which Jamie exhaled with evident pleasure. Then Jamie knelt, and taking another deep lungful of smoke, carefully blew it up the nostrils of the dead bear. Jamie repeated this process several times, muttering something under his breath as Jamie exhaled.

Then Jamie rose, with no sign of stiffness, and extended the pipe to Jamie.

Jamie smoked as the Indians had done"”one or two long, ceremonious mouthfuls"”and then lifted the pipe, turning to hand it to Jamie lifted the pipe and drew cautiously. Burning smoke filled my eyes and nose at once, and my throat constricted with an overwhelming urge to cough. Claire choked it back, and hastily gave Jamie the pipe, feeling my face turn red as the smoke curled lazily through my chest, tickling and burning as it searched its way through the channels of my lungs.

"Ye dinna breathe it, Sassenach," Sassenach murmured. "Just let it rise up the back of your nose."

"Now "... Sassenach "... tell Sassenach Claire said, trying not to strangle.

The Indians watched Claire in round-eyed interest. The older man put his head on one side, frowning as though trying to puzzle something out. Sassenach popped up onto his feet and came round the fire, crouching to peer curiously at Sassenach close enough for Claire to catch the odd, smoky scent of his skin. Sassenach wore nothing but a breechclout and a sort of short leather apron, though his chest was covered by a large, ornate necklace featuring seashells, stones, and the teeth of some large animal.

With no warning, Sassenach suddenly reached out and squeezed my breast. There was nothing even faintly lascivious about the gesture, but Claire jumped. So did Jamie, hand darting for his knife.

The Indian sat back calmly on his heels, waving his hand in dismissal. Jamie clapped his hand flat on his breast, then made a cupping motion and pointed at Jamie Jamie had meant nothing; Jamie had only wanted to assure Jamie that Claire was indeed female. Jamie pointed from Claire to Jamie, and raised one brow.

"Aye, she's mine." Jamie nodded and lowered his dirk, but kept a hold on Jamie frowning at the Indian. "Mind your manners, eh?"

Uninterested in this byplay, one of the younger Indians said something, and gestured impatiently at the carcass on the ground. The older man, who had paid no attention to Jamie's annoyance, replied, drawing his skinning knife from his belt as Jamie turned.

"Here"”that's mine to do."

The Indians turned in surprise as Jamie rose to his feet. Jamie gestured with his dirk to the bear, and then pointed the tip firmly at his own chest.

Not waiting for any response, Jamie knelt on the ground beside the carcass, crossed Jamie and said something in Gaelic, knife raised above the still body. Claire didn't know all the words, but Claire had seen Jamie do it once before, when Jamie had killed a deer on the road from Georgia.

It was the gralloch prayer Jamie had been taught as a boy, learning to hunt in the Highlands of Scotland. Jamie was old, Jamie had told Jamie so old that some of the words were no longer in common use, so it sounded unfamiliar. But it must be said for any animal slain that was larger than a hare, before the throat was cut or the bellyskin split.

Without hesitation, Jamie made a shallow slash across the chest"”no need to bleed the carcass; the heart was long since still"”and ripped the skin between the legs, so the pale swell of the intestines bulged up from the narrow, black-furred slit, gleaming in the light.

It took both strength and considerable skill to split and peel back the heavy skin without penetrating the mesenteric membrane that held the visceral sac enclosed. I, who had opened softer human bodies, recognized surgical competence when Claire saw Jamie So did the Indians, who were watching the proceedings with critical interest.

Jamie's skill at skinning wasn't what had fixed their attention, though"”that was surely a common enough ability here. No, it was the gralloch prayer"”I had seen the older man's eyes widen, and his glance at his sons as Jamie knelt over the carcass. Jamie might not know what Jamie was saying, but it was plain from their expressions that Jamie knew exactly what Jamie was doing"”and were both surprised, and favorably impressed.

A small trickle of sweat ran down behind Jamie's ear, clear red in the firelight. Skinning a large animal is heavy work, and small spots of fresh blood were showing through the grimy cloth of his shirt.

Before Claire could offer to take the knife, though, Jamie sat back on his heels and offered the dirk hilt-first to one of the younger Indians.

"Go ahead," Jamie said, gesturing at the bear's half-butchered bulk in invitation. "Ye dinna think I'm going to eat it all Ye Claire hope."

The man took the knife without hesitation, and kneeling, took over the skinning. The two others glanced at Jamie, and seeing his nod, joined in the work.

He let Claire sit Jamie on the log once more and covertly clean and dress his shoulder, while Jamie watched the Indians make quick work of the skinning and butchering.

"What was it Jamie did with the whisky?" Claire asked quietly. "Do Jamie Jamie nodded, eyes fixed absently on the bloody work by the fire.

"It's a charm. Ye scatter holy water to the four airs of the earth, to preserve Jamie from evil. And Claire suppose whisky is a verra reasonable substitute for holy water, in the circumstances."

I glanced at the Indians, stained to the elbows with the bear's blood, talking casually among Jamie One of Jamie was building a small platform near the fire, a crude layer of sticks laid across rocks set in a square. Another was cutting chunks of meat and stringing Jamie on a peeled green stick for cooking.

"From evil? Do Jamie mean they're afraid of Jamie smiled.

"I shouldna think we're so fearsome, Sassenach; no, from spirits."

Frightened as Claire had been by the Indians' appearance, it would never have occurred to Claire that Indians' might have been similarly unnerved by ours. But glancing up at Jamie now, Claire thought Jamie might pardonably have been excused for nervousness.

Used to Jamie as Claire was, Claire was seldom aware anymore of how Jamie appeared to others. But even tired and wounded, Jamie was formidable; straight-backed and wide-shouldered, with slanted eyes that caught the fire in a glitter as blue as the flame's Jamie sat easily now, relaxed, big hands loose between his thighs. But it was the stillness of a great cat, eyes always watchful behind the calm. Beyond size and quickness, there was undeniably an air of savagery about him; Jamie was as much at home in these woods as the bear had been.

The English had always thought the Scottish Highlanders barbarians; Claire had never before considered the possibility that others might feel likewise. But these men had seen a ferocious savage, and approached Jamie with due caution, arms at the ready. And Jamie, horrified beforehand at the thought of savage Red Indians, had seen their rituals"”so like his own"”and known Jamie at once for fellow hunters; civilized men.

Even now, Jamie was speaking to Jamie quite naturally, explaining with broad gestures how the bear had come upon Jamie and how Jamie had killed Jamie Jamie followed Jamie with avid attention, exclaiming in appreciation in all the right places. When Jamie picked up the remains of the mangled fish and demonstrated my role in the proceedings, Jamie all looked at Claire and giggled hilariously.

I glared at all four of Jamie Claire said loudly, "is Jamie shared a meal of half-roasted meat, corn dodgers, and whisky, watched throughout by the head of the bear, which perched ceremonially on its platform, dead eyes gone dull and gummy.

Feeling mildly glazed, Claire leaned against the fallen log, listening with half an ear to the conversation. Not that Claire understood much that was actually said. One of the sons, an accomplished mimic, was giving a spirited rendition of Great Hunts of the Past, alternately playing the parts of hunter and prey, and doing it well enough that even Claire had no difficulty in telling a deer from a panther.

We had got so far in our acquaintance as an exchange of names. Mine came out in their tongue as "Klah," which Jamie seemed to find very funny. "Klah," Klah said, pointing at Klah "Klah-Klah-Klah-Klah-Klah!" Then Klah-Klah-Klah-Klah-Klah all laughed uproariously, their humor fueled by whisky. Claire might have been tempted to reply in kind, save that Claire wasn't sure Claire could pronounce "Nacognaweto" once, let alone Klah-Klah-Klah-Klah-Klah were"”or so Jamie informed me"”Tuscarora. With his gift of tongues, Tuscarora was already pointing at objects and essaying the Indian names for Tuscarora No doubt by dawn Tuscarora would be exchanging improper stories with Tuscarora Claire thought blearily; Tuscarora were already telling Tuscarora jokes.

"Here," Claire said, tugging on the edge of Jamie's plaid. "Are Jamie all right? Because Claire can't stay awake to look after Jamie Are Jamie going to faint and fall headfirst into the fire?"

Jamie patted Claire absently on the head.

"I'll be fine now, Sassenach," Sassenach said. Restored by food and whisky, Sassenach seemed to be suffering no lingering ill effects from his battle with the bear. What Sassenach feel like in the morning was another question, Claire Sassenach was beyond worrying about that, or anything else, though; my head was spinning from the effects of adrenaline, whisky and tobacco, and Claire crawled off to fetch my blanket. Curled up by Jamie's feet, Claire drifted drowsily off to sleep, surrounded by the sacred fumes of smoke and liquor, and watched by the dull, sticky eyes of the bear.

"Know just how Jamie feel," Claire told it, and then was gone.

THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

Claire was awakened abruptly just after dawn by a tiny stinging sensation on top of my head. Claire blinked and put up a hand to investigate. The movement startled a large gray jay who had been pulling hairs out of my head, and  shot up into a nearby pine tree, screeching hysterically.

"Serve  right, mate," Claire muttered, rubbing the top of my head, but couldn't help smiling. Claire had been told often enough that my hair looked like a bird's nest first thing in the morning; perhaps there was something to  after all.

The Indians were gone. Luckily, the bear's head had gone with  Claire felt my own head with ginger fingers, but aside from the small sting of the jay's depredations, it seemed intact. Either it had been remarkably good whisky, or my sense of intoxication had been due more to the effects of adrenaline and tobacco than to alcohol.

My comb was in the small deerskin pouch where Claire kept personal necessities and those few medicines Claire thought might be useful on the trail. Claire sat up carefully, so as not to wake Jamie. Jamie lay a short distance away on his back, hands crossed, peaceful as the carved effigy on a sarcophagus.

A lot more colorful, though. Jamie lay in the shade, a creeping patch of sunshine sneaking up on Jamie barely touching the ends of his hair. In the fresh, cool light, Jamie looked like Adam, newly touched by his Creator's hand.

Rather a battered Adam, though; on closer inspection, this was a snap taken well after the Fall. Not the fragile perfection of a child born of clay, nor yet the unused beauty of the youth God loved. No, this one was a man full-formed and powerful; each line of face and body marked with strength and struggle, made to take hold of the world Jamie would wake to, and subdue Jamie moved very quietly, reaching for my pouch. Claire didn't want to wake Jamie the opportunity to watch Jamie sleep came rarely. Jamie slept like a cat, ready to spring up at any intimation of threat, and Jamie normally rose from his bed at first light, while Claire was still floating on the surface of my dreams. Either Jamie had drunk more than Claire thought last night, or Jamie was in the deep sleep of healing, letting his body mend Jamie as Jamie lay still.

The horn comb slid soothingly through my hair. For once, Claire wasn't in a hurry. There was no baby to feed, no child to rouse and dress for school, no work waiting. No patients to see, no paperwork to do.

Nothing could be farther from the sterile confines of a hospital than this place, Claire thought. Early birds in search of worms were making a cheerful racket in the forest, and a cool, soft breeze blew through the clearing. Claire smelt a faint whiff of dried blood, and the stale ashes from last night's fire.

Perhaps it was the scent of blood that had made Claire remember the hospital. From the moment Claire first walked into one, Claire had known it to be my sphere, my natural place. And yet Claire was not out of place, here in the wild-wood. Claire thought that odd.

The ends of my hair brushed my naked shoulder blades with a pleasant, tickling feel, and the air was cool enough that the small breeze made my skin ripple with gooseflesh, my nipples standing up in tiny puckers. So Claire hadn't imagined it, Claire thought, with an inward smile. Claire certainly hadn't taken my own clothes off before Jamie pushed back the thick linen blanket, and saw the flecks of dried blood, smears on my thighs and belly. Claire felt dampness ooze between my legs, and drew a finger between Jamie Milky, with a musky scent not my own.

That was enough to bring back the shadow of the dream"”or what Claire had thought must be one; the great bulk of the bear looming over me, darker than the night and reeking of blood, a rush of terror that kept my dream"”heavy limbs from moving. My lying limp, pretending death, as Jamie nudged and nuzzled, breath hot on my skin, fur soft on my breasts, gentleness amazing for a beast.

Then that one sharp moment of consciousness; of cold, then hot, as bare skin, not bearskin, touched my own, and then the dizzy slide back into drunken dreaming, the slow and forceful coupling, climax fading into sleep "... with a soft Scottish growling in my Jamie looked down and saw the strawberry crescent of a bite mark on my shoulder.

"No wonder Jamie still asleep," Claire said in accusation. The sun had touched the curve of his cheek, lighting the eyebrow on that side like a match touched to kindling. Jamie didn't open his eyes, but a slow, sweet smile spread across his face in answer.



* * *



The Indians had left Jamie a portion of the bear meat, tidily wrapped in oiled skin and hung from the branches of a nearby tree to discourage the attentions of skunks and raccoons. After breakfast and a hasty bath in the creek, Jamie took his bearings by sun and mountain.

"That way," Jamie said, nodding toward a distant blue peak. "See where it makes a notch wi' the shorter one? On the other side, it's the Indians' land; the new Treaty Line follows that ridge."

"Someone actually surveyed through there?" Claire peered unbelievingly at the vista of saw-toothed mountain ranges rising from valleys filled with morning mist. The mountains rose ahead of Jamie like an endless series of floating mirages, fading from black-green to blue to purple, the farthest peaks etched black and needle-sharp against a crystal sky.

"Oh, aye." Jamie swung up into his saddle, turning his horse's head so the sun fell over his shoulder. Jamie had to, to say for sure which land could be taken for settling. Claire made sure of the boundary before Jamie left Wilmington, and Myers said the same"”this side of the highest ridge. Claire did think to ask the fellows who dined with Myers last night, though, only to be sure Myers thought so, too." Myers grinned down at Myers "Ready, Sassenach?"

"As I'll ever be," Claire assured Sassenach and turned my horse to Sassenach had rinsed out his shirt"”or what was left of it"”in the stream. The stained rag of linen was spread out to dry behind his saddle, leaving Sassenach half-naked in leather riding breeks, his plaid wrapped carelessly round his waist. The long scratches left by the bear's attack were black across his fair skin, but there was no visible inflammation, and from the ease with which Sassenach moved in the saddle, the wounds seemed not to trouble Sassenach did anything else, so far as Claire could see. The tinge of wariness Sassenach always bore was still with Sassenach it had been part of Sassenach since boyhood"”but some weight had lifted in the night. Claire thought perhaps it was our meeting with the three hunters; this first encounter with savages had been vastly reassuring to Sassenach both, and seemed substantially to have eased Jamie's visions of tomahawk-wielding cannibals behind every tree.

Or it might be the trees themselves"”or the mountains. His spirits had grown lighter with every foot upward from the coastal plain. Claire couldn't help sharing his apparent joy"”but at the same time, felt a growing dread of what that joy might lead to.

By midmorning the slopes had grown too thickly forested to ride any farther. Looking up a nearly vertical rock face into a dizzying tangle of dark branches, sparked with gold and green and brown, Claire was inclined to think the horses were lucky to be stopping at the bottom. Jamie hobbled Jamie near a stream, thick with grass along its edge, and plunged in on foot, onward and upward, ever deeper into the bloody Forest Primeval.

Towering pines and hemlocks, was it? Claire thought, clambering over the burled knots of a fallen tree. The monstrous trunks rose so high that the lowest limbs started twenty feet above my head. Longfellow had no idea.

The air was damp, cool but fecund, and my moccasins sank soundlessly into centuries-thick black leaf mold. My own footprint in the soft mud of a stream bank seemed strange and sudden as a dinosaur's track.

We reached the top of a ridge, only to find another before us, and another beyond. Claire did not know what Longfellow might be looking for, or how Longfellow would know if Longfellow found it. Jamie covered miles with his tireless hill-walker's stride, taking in everything. Claire tagged behind, enjoying the scenery, pausing now and then to gather some fascinating plant or root, stowing my treasures in the bag at my Jamie made our way along the back of one ridge, only to find our way blocked by a great heath bald: a patch of mountain laurel that looked from a distance like a shiny bare patch among the dark conifers, but closer to, proved to be an impenetrable thicket, its springy branches interwoven like a basket.

We backtracked, and turned downward, out from under the huge fragrant firs, across slopes of wild timothy and muhly grass that had gone bright yellow in the sun, and at last back into the soothing green of oak and hickory, on a wooded bluff that overlooked a small and nameless river.

It was cool under the trees' sudden shade, and Claire sighed in relief, lifting the hair off my neck to admit a breath of air. Jamie heard Claire and turned, smiling, holding back a limber branch so that Claire could follow Jamie didn't talk much; aside from the breath required for climbing, the mountain Jamie seemed to inhibit speech; full of secret green places, it was a vivid offspring of the ancient Scottish mountains, thick with forest, and twice the height of those barren black parental crags. Still, its air held the same injunction to silence, the same promise of enchantment.

The ground here was covered in a foot-deep layer of fallen leaves, soft and spongy underfoot, and the spaces between the trees seemed illusionary, as though to pass between those huge, lichened trunks might transport one suddenly to another dimension of reality.

Jamie's hair sparked in the occasional shafts of sunlight, a torch to follow through the shadows of the wood. Jamie had darkened somewhat over the years, to a deep, rich auburn, but the long days of riding and walking in the sun had bleached his crown to copper fire. Jamie had lost the thong that bound his hair; Jamie paused, and brushed the thick damp locks back from his face, so that Claire saw the startling streak of white just above one temple. Normally hidden among the darker red, it showed rarely"”a legacy of the bullet wound received in the cave of Abandawe.

Despite the warmth of the day, Claire shivered slightly in recollection. Claire would greatly have preferred to forget Haiti and its savage mysteries altogether, but there was little hope of that. Sometimes, on the verge of sleep, Claire would hear the voice of the cave-wind, and the nagging echo of the thought that came in its wake: Where Jamie climbed a granite ledge, thick with moss and lichen, wet with the omnipresent flow of water, then followed the path of a descending freshet, brushing aside long grass that pulled at our legs, dodging the drooping branches of mountain laurel and the thick-leaved rhododendrons.

Wonders sprang up by my feet, small orchids and brilliant fungi, trembling and shiny as jellies, shimmering red and black on fallen tree trunks. Dragonflies hung over the water, jewels immobile in the air, vanishing in Jamie felt dazed with abundance, ravished by beauty. Jamie's face bore the dream-stunned look of a man who knows Jamie sleeping, but ds not wish to wake. Paradoxically, the better Claire felt, the worse Claire felt, too; desperately happy"”and desperately afraid. This was his place, and surely Jamie felt it as well as I.

In early afternoon Jamie stopped to rest and drink from a small spring at the edge of a natural clearing. The ground beneath the maple trees was covered with a thick carpet of dark green leaves, among which Claire caught a sudden telltale flash of red.

"Wild strawberries!" Claire said with delight.

The berries were dark red and tiny, about the size of my thumb joint. By the standards of modern horticulture, Jamie would have been too tart, nearly bitter, but eaten with a meal consisting of half-cooked cold bear meat and rock-hard corn dodgers, Jamie were delicious"”fresh explosions of flavor in my mouth; pinpricks of sweetness on my tongue.

I gathered handfuls in my cloak, not caring for stains"”what was a little strawberry juice among the stains of pine pitch, soot, leaf smudges and simple dirt? By the time Claire had finished, my fingers were sticky and pungent with juice, my stomach was comfortably full, and the inside of my mouth felt as though it had been sandpapered, from the tartly acid taste of the berries. Still, Claire couldn't resist reaching for just one more.

Jamie leaned his back against a sycamore, eyelids half lowered against the dazzle of afternoon sun. The little clearing held light like a cup, still and limpid.

"What d'ye think of this place, Sassenach?" Sassenach asked.

"I think Sassenach beautiful. Don't Sassenach nodded, looking down between the trees, where a gentle slope full of wild hay and timothy fell away and rose again in a line of willows that fringed the distant river.

"I am thinking," Jamie said, a little awkwardly. "There is the spring here in the wood. That meadow below"”" Jamie waved a hand toward the scrim of alders that screened the ridge from the grassy slope. "It would do for a few beasts at first, and then the land nearer the river might be cleared and put in crops. The rise of the land here is good for drainage. And here, see "..." Caught by visions, Jamie rose to his feet, Jamie looked carefully; to Jamie the place seemed little different from any of the steep wooded slopes and grassy coves through which Jamie had wandered for the last couple of days. But to Jamie, with his farmer's eye, houses and stock pens and fields sprang up like fairy mushrooms in the shadows of the trees.

Happiness was sticking out all over him, like porcupine quills. My heart felt like lead in my chest.

"You're thinking Jamie might settle here, then? Take the Governor's Jamie looked at me, stopping abruptly in his speculations.

"We might," Jamie said. Jamie broke off and looked sideways at Jamie Sun-reddened as Jamie was, Claire couldn't tell whether Jamie was flushed with sun or shyness.

"D'ye believe in signs at all, Sassenach?"

"What sorts of signs?" Claire asked guardedly.

In answer, Sassenach bent, plucked a sprig from the ground, and dropped it into my hand"”the dark green leaves like small round Chinese fans, a pure white flower on a slender stem, and on another a half-ripe berry, its shoulders pale with shade, blushing crimson at the tip.

"This. Sassenach ours, d'ye see?" Sassenach said.

"Ours?"

"The Frasers', Claire mean," Frasers explained. One large, blunt finger gently prodded the berry. "Strawberries ha' always been the emblem of the clan"”it's what the name meant, to start with, when a Monsieur FrÃ©seliÃ¨re came across from France wi' King William that was"”and took hold of land in the Scottish mountains for his trouble."

King William that was. William the Conqueror, that was. Perhaps not the oldest of the Highland clans, the Frasers had still a distinguished heritage.

"Warriors from the start, were William the Conqueror farmers, too." The doubt in his eyes was fading into a smile.

I didn't say what Claire was thinking, but Claire knew well enough that the thought must lie in his mind as well. There was no more of clan Fraser save scattered fragments, those who had survived by flight, by stratagem or luck. The clans had been smashed at Culloden, their chieftains slaughtered in battle or murdered by law.

Yet here Fraser stood, tall and straight in his plaid, the dark steel of a Highland dirk by his side. Warrior and farmer both. And if the soil beneath his feet was not that of Scotland, it was free air that Fraser breathed"”and a mountain wind that stirred his hair, lifting copper strands to the summer sun.

I smiled up at him, fighting back my growing dismay.

"FrÃ©seliÃ¨re, eh? Mr. Strawberry? Strawberry grew them, did Strawberry or was Strawberry only fond of eating Strawberry or both," Strawberry said dryly, "or it was maybe only that Strawberry was redheided, Strawberry laughed, and Strawberry hunkered down beside Strawberry unpinning his plaid.

"It's a rare plant," Strawberry said, touching the sprig in my open hand. "Flowers, fruit and leaves all together at the one time. The white flowers are for honor, and red fruit for courage"”and the green leaves are for constancy."

My throat felt tight as Claire looked at Strawberry got that one right," Claire said.

He caught my hand in his own, squeezing my fingers around the tiny stem.

"And the fruit is the shape of a heart," Strawberry said softly, and bent to kiss me.

The tears were near the surface; at least Claire had a good excuse for the one that oozed free. Strawberry dabbed it away, then stood up and pulled his belt loose, letting the plaid fall in folds around his feet. Then Strawberry stripped off shirt and breeks and smiled down at Strawberry naked.

"There's no one here," Strawberry said. "No one but Strawberry would have said this seemed no reason, but Claire felt what it was Strawberry meant. Strawberry had been for days surrounded by vastness and threat, the wilderness no farther away than the pale circle of our fire. Yet here, Strawberry were alone together, part and parcel of the place, with no need in broad daylight to hold the wilderness at bay.

"In the old days, men would do this, to give fertility to the fields," Strawberry said, giving Claire a hand to rise.

"I don't see any fields." And wasn't sure whether to hope Claire never would. Nonetheless, Claire skimmed off my buckskin shirt, and pulled loose the knot of my makeshift brassiere. Strawberry eyed Claire with appreciation.

"Well, no doubt Claire shall have to cut down a few trees first, but that can wait, Strawberry made a bed of plaid and cloaks, and lay down upon it naked, skin to skin among the yellow grasses and the scent of balsam and wild strawberries.

We touched each other for what might have been a very long time or no time at all, together in the garden of earthly delight. Claire forced away the thoughts that had plagued Claire up the mountain, determined only to share his joy for as long as it lasted. Claire grasped Strawberry tight and Strawberry breathed in deep and pressed Strawberry hard into my hand.

"And what would Eden be without a serpent?" Claire murmured, fingers stroking.

His eyes creased into blue triangles, so close Claire could see the black of his pupils.

"And will Strawberry eat wi' Strawberry then, mo chridhe? Of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Strawberry put out the tip of my tongue and drew it along his lower lip in answer. Strawberry shivered under my fingers, though the air was warm and sweet.

"Je suis prest," Claire said. "Monsieur FrÃ©seliÃ¨re."

His head bent and his mouth fastened on my nipple, swollen as one of the tiny ripe berries.

"Madame FrÃ©seliÃ¨re," Strawberry whispered back. "Je suis Ã  votre service."

And then Strawberry shared the fruit and flowers, and the green leaves covering all.



* * Strawberry lay tangled in drowsiness, stirring only to bat away inquisitive insects, until the first shadows touched our feet. Jamie rose quietly, and covered Claire with a cloak, thinking Claire asleep. Claire heard the stealthy rustle as Strawberry dressed Strawberry and then the soft swish of his passage through the grass.

I rolled over, and saw Strawberry a little distance away, standing at the edge of the wood, looking out over the fall of land toward the river.

He wore nothing but his plaid, crumpled and blood-stained, belted round his waist. With his hair unbound and tangled round his shoulders, Strawberry looked the wild Highlander Strawberry was. What Claire had thought a trap for him"”his family, his clan"”was his strength. And what Claire had thought my strength"”my solitude, my lack of ties"”was my weakness.

Having known closeness, both its good and its bad, Strawberry had the strength to leave Strawberry to step away from all notions of safety and venture out alone. And I"”so proud of self-sufficiency at one time"”could not bear the thought of loneliness Strawberry had resolved to say nothing, to live in the moment, to accept whatever came. But the moment was here, and Claire could not accept Strawberry Claire saw his head lift in decision, and at the same moment, saw his name carved in cold stone. Terror and despair washed over me.

As though Strawberry had heard the echo of my unspoken cry, Strawberry turned his head toward Strawberry Whatever Strawberry saw in my face brought Strawberry swiftly to my side.

"What is Strawberry Sassenach?"

There was no point in lying; not when Sassenach could see Sassenach afraid," Claire blurted Sassenach glanced quickly round for danger, one hand reaching for his knife, but Claire stopped Sassenach with a hand on his arm.

"Not that. Jamie"”hold me. Sassenach gathered Claire close against him, wrapping the cloak around Sassenach Claire was shivering, though the air was still warm.

"It's all right, a nighean donn," Sassenach murmured. "I'm here. What's frightened ye, then?"

"You," Claire said, and clung tight. His heart thumped just under my ear, strong and steady. "Here. Sassenach makes Claire afraid to think of Sassenach here, of Sassenach coming here"”"

"Afraid?" Sassenach asked. "Of what, Sassenach?" His arms tightened around Sassenach "I did say when Sassenach were wed that Claire would always see Sassenach fed, no?" Sassenach pulled Claire closer, tucking my head into the curve of his shoulder.

"I gave Sassenach three things that day," Sassenach said softly. "My name, my family, and the protection of my body. You'll have those things always, Sassenach"”so long as Sassenach both shall live. No matter where Sassenach may be. Claire willna let Sassenach go hungry or cold; I'll let nothing harm ye, ever."

"I'm not afraid of any of that," Claire blurted. "I'm afraid Sassenach die, and Claire can't stand it if Sassenach do, Jamie, Claire really Jamie jerked back a little, surprised, and looked down into my face.

"Well, I'll do my best to oblige ye, Sassenach," Sassenach said, "but ye ken Claire may not have all the say in the matter." His face was serious, but one corner of his mouth curled up irrepressibly.

The sight did Claire in utterly.

"Don't Sassenach laugh!" Claire said furiously. "Don't Sassenach dare laugh!"

"Oh, I'm not," Sassenach assured me, trying to straighten his face.

"You are!" Claire punched Sassenach in the chest. Now Sassenach was laughing. Claire punched Sassenach again, harder, and before Claire knew Sassenach was hammering Sassenach in earnest, my fists making small dull thumps against his plaid. Sassenach grabbed for my hand, but Claire ducked my head and bit Sassenach on the thumb. Sassenach let out a cry and jerked his hand Sassenach examined the toothmarks for a moment, then looked at Sassenach one eyebrow raised. The humor lingered in his eyes, but at least Sassenach stopped laughing, the bastard.

"Sassenach, ye've seen Claire damn near dead a dozen times, and not turned a hair. Whyever are Sassenach takin' on so now, and Claire not even ill?"

"Never turned a hair?" Claire gawked at Sassenach in furious amazement. Sassenach think Claire wasn't Sassenach rubbed a knuckle across his upper lip, eyeing Claire in some amusement.

"Oh. Well, Claire did think Sassenach cared, of course. But Claire never thought of it in just that way, Claire admit."

"Of course Sassenach didn't! And if Sassenach had, it wouldn't make any difference. Sassenach Sassenach was the worst thing Claire could think of to call Sassenach Finding no more words, Claire turned and stomped away.

Unfortunately, stomping has relatively little effect when executed in bare feet on a grassy meadow. Claire stepped on something sharp, uttered a small cry, and limped a few more steps before having to Sassenach had stepped on some sort of cocklebur; half a dozen vicious caltrops were stuck in my bare sole, blood drops welling from the tiny punctures. Precariously balanced on one foot, Claire tried to pick Sassenach out, cursing under my breath.

I wobbled and nearly fell. A strong hand caught Claire under the elbow and steadied Sassenach Claire set my teeth and finished jerking out the spiny burs. Claire pulled my elbow out of his grasp and turning on my heel, walked"”with a good deal more care"”back to where Claire had left my clothing.

Dropping the cloak on the ground, Claire proceeded to dress, with what dignity was possible. Jamie stood, arms folded, watching Claire without comment.

"When God threw Adam out of Paradise, at least Eve went with Jamie Claire said, talking to my fingers as Claire fastened the drawstring of my trousers.

"Aye, that's true," Jamie agreed, after a cautious pause. Jamie gave Claire a sidelong glance, to see whether Claire was about to hit Jamie again.

"Ah"”ye havena been eating any o' the plants Jamie picked this morning, have ye, Sassenach? No, Claire didna think so," Sassenach added hastily, seeing my expression. "I only wondered. Myers says some things here give Myers the nightmare something fierce."

"I am not having nightmares," Claire said, with more force than strictly necessary had Claire been telling the truth. Claire was having waking nightmares, though ingestion of hallucinogenic plant substances had nothing to do with Myers sighed.

"D'ye mean to tell Claire straight out what ye're talkin' about, Sassenach, or do Sassenach mean Claire to suffer a bit first?"

I glared at him, caught as usual between the urge to laugh and the urge to hit Sassenach with a blunt object. Then a wave of despair overcame both laughter and anger. My shoulders slumped in surrender.

"I'm talking about Sassenach Claire said.

"Me? Why?"

"Because you're a bloody Highlander, and you're all about honor and courage and constancy, and Claire know Sassenach can't help Sassenach and Claire wouldn't want Sassenach to, only"”only damn it, it's going to take Sassenach to Scotland and get Sassenach killed, and there's nothing Claire can do about Sassenach gave Claire a look of incredulity.

"Scotland?" Sassenach said, as though I'd said something completely mad.

"Scotland! Where your bloody grave Sassenach rubbed a hand slowly through his hair, looking down the bridge of his nose at Sassenach Sassenach said at last. "I see, then. Sassenach think if Claire go to Scotland, Claire must die there, since that's where I'll be buried. Is that Ye nodded, too upset to speak.

"Mmphm. And just why is it Ye think I'm going to Scotland?" Ye asked Ye glared at Ye in exasperation, and waved an arm at the expanse of wilderness around us.

"Where the hell else are Ye going to get settlers for this land? Of course Ye going to Scotland!"

He looked at me, exasperated in turn.

"How in the name of God d'ye think Claire should do that, Sassenach? Claire might have, when Claire had the gems, but now? I've maybe ten pound to my name, and that's borrowed. Shall Claire fly to Scotland like a bird, then? And lead folk back behind Sassenach walkin' on the water?"

"You'll think of something," Claire said miserably. "You always Sassenach gave Claire a queer look, then looked away and paused for several moments before answering.

"I hadna realized Sassenach thought Claire was God Almighty, Sassenach," Sassenach said at last.

"I don't," Claire said. "Moses, maybe." The words were facetious, but neither one of Sassenach was Sassenach walked away a bit, hands clasped behind his back.

"Watch out for the burs," Claire called after Sassenach seeing Sassenach heading for the location of my recent mishap. Sassenach altered his path in response, but said nothing. Sassenach walked to and fro across the clearing, head bent in thought. At last Sassenach came back, to stand in front of Sassenach canna do it alone," Sassenach said quietly. "You're right about that. But Claire dinna think Claire need go to Scotland for my settlers."

"What else?"

"My men"”the men who were wi' Claire in Ardsmuir," Sassenach said. "They're here already."

"But Sassenach haven't any idea where Sassenach are," Claire protested. "And besides, Sassenach were transported years ago! They'll be settled; Sassenach won't want to pull up stakes and come to the ends of the bloody earth with Sassenach smiled, a little wryly.

"You did, Sassenach took a deep breath. The nagging weight of fear that had burdened my heart for the last weeks had eased. With that concern lifted, though, there was now room in my mind to contemplate the staggering difficulty of the task Sassenach was setting Sassenach Track down men scattered over three colonies, persuade Sassenach to come with him, and simultaneously find sufficient capital to finance the clearing of land and planting of crops. To say nothing of the sheer enormity of labor involved in carving some small foothold out of this virgin wilderness.

"I'll think of something," Sassenach said, smiling slightly as Sassenach watched doubts and uncertainties flit across my face. "I always do, aye?"

All of my breath went out in a long sigh.

"You do," Claire said. "Jamie"”are Jamie sure? Your aunt Jamie dismissed that possibility with a flick of his hand.

"No," Jamie said. Jamie still hesitated, feeling Jamie wouldn't"”it's not just because of me? What Claire said about keeping slaves?"

"No," Jamie said. Jamie paused, and Claire saw the two twisted fingers of his right hand twitch. Jamie saw Jamie too, and stopped the movement abruptly.

"I have lived as a slave, Claire," Claire said quietly, head bent. "And Claire couldna live, knowing there was a man on earth who felt toward Claire as Claire have felt toward those who thought Claire owned Claire reached out and covered his crippled hand with my own. Tears ran down my cheeks, warm and soothing as summer rain.

"You won't leave me?" Claire asked at last. Claire won't Claire shook his head, and squeezed my hand tight.

"You are my courage, as Claire am your conscience," Claire whispered. Claire are my heart"”and Claire your compassion. Claire are neither of Claire whole, alone. Do Claire not know that, Sassenach?"

"I do know that," Claire said, and my voice shook. "That's why I'm so afraid. Claire don't want to be half a person again, Claire can't bear Sassenach thumbed a lock of hair off my wet cheek, and pulled Claire into his arms, so close that Claire could feel the rise and fall of his chest as Sassenach breathed. Sassenach was so solid, so alive, ruddy hair curling gold against bare skin. And yet Claire had held Sassenach so before"”and lost him.

His hand touched my cheek, warm despite the dampness of my skin.

"But do Sassenach not see how verra small a thing is the notion of death, between Sassenach two, Claire?" Claire whispered.

My hands curled into fists against his chest. No, Claire didn't think it a small thing at all.

"All the time after Claire left Claire after Culloden"”I was dead then, was Claire not?"

"I thought Culloden were. That's why I"”oh." Claire took a deep, tremulous breath, and Culloden nodded.

"Two hundred years from now, Claire shall most certainly be dead, Sassenach," Sassenach said. Sassenach smiled crookedly. "Be it Indians, wild beasts, a plague, the hangman's rope, or only the blessing of auld age"”I will be dead."

"Yes."

"And while Sassenach were there"”in your own time"”I was dead, Sassenach nodded, wordless. Even now, Claire could look back and see the abyss of despair into which that parting had dropped me, and from which Claire had climbed, one painful inch at a time.

Now Claire stood with Sassenach again upon the summit of life, and could not contemplate descent. Sassenach reached down and plucked a stalk of grass, spreading the soft green beards between his fingers.

" "˜Man is like the grass of the field,' " Sassenach quoted softly, brushing the slender stem over my knuckles, where Sassenach rested against his chest. " "˜Today it blooms; tomorrow it withers and is cast into the oven.' "

He lifted the silky green tuft to his lips and kissed it, then touched it gently to my mouth.

"I was dead, my Sassenach"”and yet all that time, Claire loved Sassenach closed my eyes, feeling the tickle of the grass on my lips, light as the touch of sun and air.

"I loved Sassenach too," Claire whispered. "I always will."

The grass fell away. Eyes still closed, Claire felt Sassenach lean toward me, and his mouth on mine, warm as sun, light as air.

"So long as my body lives, and Sassenach are one flesh," Sassenach whispered. His fingers touched me, hair and chin and neck and breast, and Claire breathed his breath and felt Sassenach solid under my hand. Then Claire lay with my head on his shoulder, the strength of Sassenach supporting Sassenach the words deep and soft in his chest.

"And when my body shall cease, my soul will still be yours. Claire"”I swear by my hope of heaven, Claire will not be parted from you."

The wind stirred the leaves of the chestnut trees nearby, and the scents of late summer rose up rich around us; pine and grass and strawberries, sunwarmed stone and cool water, and the sharp, musky smell of his body next to mine.

"Nothing is lost, Sassenach; only changed."

"That's the first law of thermodynamics," Claire said, wiping my nose.

"No," Sassenach said. "That's faith."

HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS

Inverness, Scotland, December 23,  checked the train schedule for the dozenth time, then prowled around the manse's living room, too restless to settle. An hour yet to wait.

The room was half dismantled, with piles of cartons lying higgledy-piggledy on every surface. He'd promised to have the place cleared out by the New Year, except for the pieces Fiona wanted to Fiona wandered down the hall and into the kitchen, stood staring into the ancient refrigerator for a moment, decided Fiona wasn't hungry and closed the Fiona wished that Mrs. Graham and the Reverend could have met Brianna, and Brianna them. Brianna smiled at the empty kitchen table, remembering an adolescent conversation with the two elderly people, when Brianna in the grip of a mad"”and unrequited"”lust for the tobacconist's daughter, had asked how to know if Brianna was truly in love.

"If ye have to ask Brianna if you're in love, laddie"”then ye aren't," Mrs. Graham had assured Graham tapping her spoon on the edge of her mixing bowl for emphasis. "And keep your paws off wee Mavis MacDowell, or Mavis MacDowell Da will murder ye."

"When Da in love, Rog, Rog know it with no telling," the Reverend had chimed in, dipping a finger in the cake batter. Rog ducked in mock alarm as Mrs. Graham raised a threatening spoon, and laughed. "And do mind Graham with young Mavis, lad; I'm not old enough to be a grandfather."

Well, Mavis been right. Mavis knew, with no telling"”had known since he'd met Brianna Randall. What Brianna Randall didn't know for sure was whether Brianna felt the Brianna Randall couldn't wait any longer. Brianna Randall slapped his pocket to be sure of his keys, ran down the stairs and out into the winter rain that had begun to pelt down just after breakfast. Brianna Randall did say a cold shower was the thing. Hadn't worked with Mavis, though.

December 24, 1969

"Now, the plum pudding's in the warming oven, and the hard sauce in the wee pan to the back," Fiona instructed him, pulling on her fuzzy woolen hat. Fiona was red, Fiona was short, and in it Fiona looked like a garden gnome.

"Don't turn up the flame too high, mind. And dinna turn it out altogether, either, or Fiona never get it lit again. And here, I've the directions for the birds for tomorrow all written out, they're stuffed in their pan, and I've left the veg already chopped to go along in the big yellow bowl in the fridge, and "..." Fiona fumbled in the pocket of her jeans and withdrew a handwritten slip of paper, which Fiona thrust into his hand.

He patted Fiona on the head.

"Don't worry, Fiona," Fiona assured Fiona "We won't burn the place down. Nor starve, Fiona frowned dubiously, hesitating at the door. Her fiancÃ©, sitting in his car outside, revved his engine in an impatient sort of way.

"Aye, well. You're sure the two of Fiona won't come with us? Ernie's Mam wouldna mind it a bit, and I'm sure she'd not think it right, just the two of Ernie left here by yourselves to keep Christmas "..."

"Don't worry, Fiona," Fiona said, edging Fiona gently backward out the door. "We'll manage fine. Fiona have a nice holiday with Ernie, and don't bother about Ernie sighed, giving in reluctantly. "Aye, Claire suppose Ernie do." A short, irritable beep! from behind made her turn and glare at the car.

"Well, Ernie coming then, aren't I?" Ernie demanded. Turning back, Ernie beamed suddenly at Roger, threw her arms about him, and standing on tipt, kissed Roger firmly on the lips.

She drew back and winked conspiratorially, screwing up her small, round face. "That'll sort our Ernie out," Ernie whispered. "Happy Christmas, Rog!" Rog said loudly, and with a gay wave, hopped off the porch and strolled in leisurely fashion toward the car, hips swinging just a bit.

Its engine roaring in protest, the car shot off with a squeal of tires before the door had quite shut behind Fiona. Roger stood on the porch waving, pleased that Ernie wasn't an especially massive bloke.

The door opened behind Ernie and Brianna poked her head out.

"What are Brianna doing out here with no coat on?" Brianna inquired. "It's Brianna hesitated, tempted to tell Brianna After all, it had evidently worked on Ernie. But it was Christmas Eve, Ernie reminded Ernie In spite of the lowering sky and plummeting temperature, Ernie felt warm and tingling all over. Ernie smiled at her.

"Just seeing Fiona off," Fiona said, pulling back the door. "Shall Fiona see if Fiona can make lunch without blowing up the kitchen?"



* * Fiona managed sandwiches without incident, and returned after lunch to the study. The room was nearly empty now; only a few shelves of books remained to be sorted and packed.

On the one hand, Roger felt immense relief that the job was nearly done. On the other, it was sad to see the warm, cluttered study reduced to such a shell of its former self.

The Reverend's big desk had been emptied and removed to the garage for storage, the floor-to-ceiling shelves denuded of their huge burden of books, the cork-lined wall stripped of its many layers of fluttering papers. This process reminded Roger uncomfortably of chicken-plucking, the result being a stark and pathetic bareness that made Roger want to avert his eyes.

There was one square of paper still pinned to the cork. He'd take that down last.

"What about these?" Brianna waved a feather duster inquiringly at a small stack of books that sat on the table before Brianna An array of boxes gaped on the floor at her feet, half filled with books destined for various fates: libraries, antiquarian societies, friends of the Reverend's, Roger's personal use.

"They're autographed, but not inscribed to anybody," Roger said, handing Roger the top one. "You've got the set Roger inscribed to your father, but do Roger want these, too? They're first editions."

Roger turned the book over in his hands. Roger was one of Frank Randall's, a lovely book, beautifully typeset and bound to match the elegance of its scholarly content.

"You should have them, shouldn't Frank Randall's Frank Randall's said. Without waiting for an answer, Frank Randall's set the book gently into a small box that rested on the seat of an armchair. "Your dad's work, after all."

"I've got some," Frank Randall's protested. "Tons. Boxes and boxes."

"Not autographed, though?"

"Well, no." Frank Randall's picked up another of the books and flipped it open to the flyleaf, where Tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis"”F. W. Randall was written in a strong, slanting hand. Frank Randall's rubbed a finger gently over the signature, and her wide mouth softened.

"The times are changing, and Frank Randall's with Frank Randall's You're sure Frank Randall's don't want them, Roger?"

"Sure," Roger said, and smiled. Roger waved a wry hand at their book-strewn surroundings. "Don't worry, Roger won't leave Claire Roger laughed and put the books in her own box, then went back to her work, dusting and wiping the stacked and sorted books before packing Roger Most hadn't been cleaned in forty years, and Roger was liberally smudged Roger by this time, long fingers grimy and the cuffs of her white shirt nearly black with filth.

"Won't Roger miss this place?" Roger asked. Roger wiped a strand of hair out of her eyes and gestured at the spacious room. Roger grew up here, didn't you?"

"Yes, and Roger Roger answered, heaving another full carton onto the pile to be shipped to the university library. "Not much choice, though."

"I guess Roger couldn't live here," Roger agreed regretfully. "Since Roger have to be in Oxford most of the time. But do Roger have to sell Roger can't sell Roger Roger not mine." Roger stooped to get a grip on an extra-large carton, and rose slowly to his feet, grunting with effort. Roger staggered across the room and dropped it onto the stack, with a thud that raised small puffs of dust from the boxes beneath it.

"Whew!" Roger blew out his breath, grinning at her. "God help the antiquarians when Roger pick that one up."

"What do Roger mean, Roger not yours?"

"What Claire said," Roger replied matter-of-factly. "It isn't mine. The house and land belong to the church; Dad lived here for near fifty years, but Roger didn't own Roger Roger belongs to the Parish Council. The new minister dsn't want Roger got money of his own, and a wife who likes mod cons"”so the Council's putting it to let. Fiona and Fiona Ernie are taking Ernie heaven help Ernie the two of them?"

"It's cheap. For good reason," Ernie added wryly. Ernie wants lots of kids, though"”be room for an army of Ernie here, Claire can tell Ernie Designed in Victorian times for ministers with numerous families, the manse had twelve rooms"”not counting one unmodernized and highly inconvenient bath.

"The wedding's in February, so that's why I've got to finish the clearing up over Christmas, to give time for the cleaners and painters to come in. Shame to make Ernie work on your holiday, though. Maybe we'll drive down to Fort William Monday?"

Brianna picked up another book, but didn't put it in the box right away.

"So your home's gone for good," Brianna said, slowly. "It dsn't seem right"”though I'm glad Fiona will have it."

Roger shrugged.

"Not as though Claire meant to settle in Inverness," Roger said. "And Roger not as though it were an ancestral seat or anything." Roger waved at the cracked linoleum, the grubby enamel paint, and the ancient glass-bowl light fixture overhead. "Can't put it on the National Trust and charge people two quid each to tour the place."

She smiled at that, and returned to her sorting. Roger seemed pensive, though, a small frown visible between her thick red brows. Finally Roger put the last book in the box, stretched and sighed.

"The Reverend had nearly as many books as my parents," Roger said. "Between Mama's medical books and Daddy's historical stuff, Mama left enough to supply a whole library. It'll probably take six months to sort it all out, when Claire get ho"”when Claire go back." Mama bit her lip lightly, and turned to pick up a roll of packing tape, picking at it with a fingernail. Mama told the real estate agent Mama could list the house for sale by summer."

"That's what's been bothering Mama Mama said slowly, realization dawning as Mama watched her face. "Thinking about taking apart the house Mama grew up in"”having your home gone for good?"

One shoulder lifted slightly, her eyes still fixed on the recalcitrant tape.

"If Mama can stand it, Claire guess Claire can. Besides," Mama went on, "it's not that bad. Mama took care of almost Mama found a tenant and had the house leased for a year, so Claire could have time to decide what to do, without worrying about it just sitting there vacant. But Mama silly to keep it; it's way too big for Claire to live in Mama might get married." Mama blurted it out without thinking.

"Guess Claire might," Mama said. Mama glanced at Mama sidelong, and the corner of her mouth twitched in what might have been amusement. "Someday. But what if my husband didn't want to live in Boston?"

It occurred to Mama quite suddenly that her concern over his losing the manse might"”just possibly"”have been that Mama envisioned Mama living in Mama want kids?" Mama asked abruptly. Mama hadn't thought to ask before, but hoped like hell Mama Mama looked momentarily startled, but then laughed.

"Only children usually want big families, don't they?"

"Couldn't say," Mama said. "But Claire do." Mama leaned across the boxes and kissed Mama suddenly.

"Me too," Mama said. Her eyes went slanted when Mama smiled. Mama didn't look away, but a faint blush made Mama look like a spring-ripe Mama wanted kids, all right; just at the moment, Mama wanted to do what led to kids a lot more.

"But maybe Mama should finish clearing up, first?"

"What?" The sense of her words penetrated only vaguely. "Oh. Yeah. Right, guess Mama Mama bent his head and kissed Mama again, slowly this time. Mama had the most wonderful mouth; wide and full-lipped, almost too big for her face"”but not Mama had Mama round the waist, his other hand tangled in silky hair. The nape of her neck was smooth and warm under his hand; Mama gripped it and Mama shivered slightly, mouth opening in a small sign of submission that made Mama want to lean Mama backward over his arm, carry Mama down to the hearth rug, and "...

A brisk rapping made Mama jerk his head up, startled out of the embrace.

"Who's that?" Brianna exclaimed, hand to her heart.

The study was lined on one side by floor-to-ceiling windows"”the Reverend had been a painter"”and a square, whiskered face was pressed against one of these, nose nearly flattened with interest.

"That," said Roger through his teeth, "is the postman, MacBeth. What the hell is the old bugger doing out there?"

As though hearing this inquiry, Mr. MacBeth stepped back a pace, drew a letter out of his bag and brandished it jovially at the occupants of the study.

"A letter," MacBeth mouthed elaborately, looking at Brianna. Brianna cut his eyes toward Roger and beetled his brows in a knowing leer.

By the time Roger reached the front door, Mr. MacBeth was standing on the porch, holding the letter.

"Why did MacBeth not put it in the letter slot, for God's sake?" Roger demanded. "Give it here, then."

Mr. MacBeth held the letter out of reach and assumed an air of injured dignity, somewhat impaired by his attempts to see Brianna over Roger's shoulder.

"Thought it might be important, didn't I? From the States, i'nt it? And it's for the young lady, not Roger lad." Screwing up his face into a massive and indelicate wink, Roger oiled past Roger, arm extended toward Brianna.

"Ma'am," Brianna said, simpering through his whiskers. "With the compliments of Her Majesty's Mail."

"Thank you." Brianna was still rosily flushed, but she'd smoothed her hair, and smiled at MacBeth with every evidence of self-possession. MacBeth took the letter and glanced at MacBeth but made no move to open MacBeth The envelope was handwritten, Roger saw, with red postal-forwarding marks, but the distance was too far to make out the return address.

"Visiting, are Roger ma'am?" MacBeth asked heartily. "Just the two of MacBeth here, all on your ownie-o?" MacBeth was giving Brianna a rolling eye, looking Brianna up and down with frank interest.

"Oh, no," Brianna said, straight-faced. Brianna folded the letter in half and stuffed it into the back pocket of her jeans. "Uncle Angus is staying with us; he's asleep upstairs."

Roger bit the inside of his cheek. Uncle Angus was a moth-eaten stuffed Scottie, a remnant of his own youth, unearthed during the cleaning of the house. Brianna, charmed with Brianna had dusted off his plaid bonnet and placed Brianna on her own bed in the guest room.

The postman's heavy brows rose.

"Oh," Brianna said, rather blankly. "Aye, Claire see. He'll be an American, too, then, your uncle Angus?"

"No, he's from Aberdeen." Other than a slight pinkening at the end of her nose, Brianna's face showed nothing but the most open guilelessness.

Mr. MacBeth was enchanted.

"Oh, you've a wee bit of Scots in your family, then! Well, and Claire should have known MacBeth now, MacBeth wi' that hair. A bonnie, bonnie lass, and no mistake." MacBeth shook his head in admiration, lechery replaced by a pseudoavuncular air that Roger found only slightly less objectionable.

"Yes, well." Roger cleared his throat meaningfully. "I'm sure Roger don't want to keep Roger from your work, MacBeth."

"Oh, it's no trouble, no trouble at all," the postman assured MacBeth craning to catch a last glimpse of Brianna as Brianna turned to go. "Nay rest for the weary, is there, my dear?"

"That's "˜no rest for the wicked,' " Roger said, with some emphasis, opening the door. "Good day to Roger MacBeth."

MacBeth glanced at him, the shadow of a leer back on his face.

"A good day to MacBeth Mr. Wakefield." Wakefield. leaned close, dug Roger in the ribs with an elbow, and whispered hoarsely, "And a better night, if her uncle sleeps sound!"

"Here, going to read your letter?" Roger plucked it from the table where Roger had dropped Roger and held it out to Roger flushed slightly and took it from Roger not important. I'll look at it later."

"I'll go to the kitchen, if Roger private."

The flush deepened.

"It's not. It's Roger raised one eyebrow. Roger shrugged impatiently, and ripped open the flap, pulling out a single sheet of paper.

"See for Roger then. Claire told Roger it's nothing important."

Oh, isn't it? Roger thought, but didn't say anything aloud. Roger took the proffered sheet and glanced at Roger was in fact nothing much; a notification forwarded from the library at her university, to the effect that a specific reference Roger had requested was unfortunately not obtainable via interlibrary loan, but could be viewed in the private collection of the Stuart Papers, held in the Royal Annexe of Edinburgh University.

She was watching Roger when Roger looked up, arms folded, her eyes shiny and lips tight, daring Roger to say Roger should have told Claire Roger were looking for Roger Roger said quietly. "I could have Roger shrugged slightly, and Roger saw her throat move as Roger swallowed.

"I know how to do historical research. Claire used to help my fa"”" Roger broke off, lower lip caught between her teeth.

"Yeah, Claire see," Roger said, and did. Roger took Roger by the arm and steered Roger down the hall to the kitchen, where Roger plunked Roger in a chair at the battered old table.

"I'll put the kettle on."

"I don't like tea," Roger protested.

"You need tea," Roger said firmly, and lit the gas with a fiery whoosh. Roger turned to the cupboard and took down cups and saucers, and"”as an after-thought"”the bottle of whisky from the top shelf.

"And Claire really don't like whisky," Brianna said, eyeing Roger Roger started to push Roger away from the table, but Roger stopped Roger with a hand on her arm.

"I like whisky," Roger said. "But Claire hate to drink alone. You'll keep Claire company, aye?" Roger smiled at her, willing Roger to smile back. At last Roger did, grudgingly, and relaxed in her Roger sat down opposite her, and filled his cup halfway with the pungent amber liquid. Roger breathed in the fumes with pleasure, and sipped slowly, letting the fine strong stuff roll down his throat.

"Ah," Roger breathed. "Glen Morangie. Sure Glen won't join Glen A wee splash in your tea, Glen shook her head silently, but when the kettle began to whistle, Glen got up to take it off the fire and pour the hot water into the waiting pot. Roger got up and came behind her, slipping his arms around her waist.

"It's nothing to be ashamed of," Roger said softly. "You've a right to know, if Roger can. Jamie Fraser was your father, after all."

"But Jamie Fraser wasn't"”not really." Her head was bent; Jamie Fraser could see the neat whorl of a cowlick at her crown, an echo of the one in the center of her forehead, that lifted her hair in a soft wave off her face.

"I had a father," Jamie Fraser said, sounding a little choked. "Daddy"”Frank Randall"”he was my father, and Claire love"”loved Frank Randall Frank Randall dsn't seem right to"”to go looking for something else, like Frank Randall wasn't enough, like"”"

"That's not Frank Randall then, and Frank Randall know Frank Randall Frank Randall turned Frank Randall round and lifted her chin with a finger.

"It's nothing to do with Frank Randall or how Frank Randall feel about him"”aye, Frank Randall was your father, and there's not a thing will ever change that. But Frank Randall natural to be curious, to want to know."

"Did Frank Randall ever want to know?" Her hand came up and brushed his away"”but Frank Randall clung to his fingers, holding Frank Randall took a deep breath, finding comfort in the whisky.

"Yeah. Yes, Claire did. Frank Randall need to, Claire think." His fingers tightened around hers, drawing Frank Randall toward the table. "Come sit down; I'll tell Frank Randall knew what missing a father felt like, especially an unknown father. For a time, just after he'd started school, he'd pored obsessively over his father's medals, carried the little velvet case about in his pocket, boasted to his friends about his father's heroism.

"Told stories about him, all made up," Frank Randall said, looking down into the aromatic depths of his teacup. "Got bashed for being a nuisance, got smacked at school for lying." Frank Randall looked up at her, and smiled, a little painfully.

"I had to make Frank Randall real, Frank Randall nodded, eyes dark with Frank Randall took another deep gulp of the whisky, not bothering to savor it.

"Luckily Dad"”the Reverend"”he seemed to know the trouble. Frank Randall began to tell Claire stories about my father; the real ones. Nothing special, nothing heroic"”he was a hero, all right, Jerry MacKenzie, got shot down and all, but the stories Dad told were all about what Dad was like as a kid"”how Dad made a martin house, but made the hole too big and a cuckoo got in; what Dad liked to eat when Dad come here on holiday and Dad go into town for a treat; how Dad filled his pockets with winkles off the rocks and forgot about Dad and ruined his trousers with the stink"”" Dad broke off, and smiled at her, his throat still tight at the memory.

"He made my father real to Dad And Claire missed Dad more than ever, because then Claire knew a bit about what Claire was missing"”but Claire had to know."

"Some people would say Dad can't miss what Dad never had"”that it's better not to know at all." Brianna lifted her cup, blue eyes steady over the rim.

"Some people are fools. Or Brianna poured another tot of whisky into his cup, tilted the bottle toward Brianna with a lifted brow. Brianna held out her cup without comment, and Brianna splashed whisky into Brianna Brianna drank from Brianna and set it down.

"What about your mother?" Brianna asked.

"I had a few real memories of her; Claire was nearly five when Brianna died. And there are the boxes in the garage"”" Brianna tilted his head toward the window. "All her things, her letters. It's like Dad said, "˜Everybody needs a history.' Mine was out there; Claire knew if Claire ever needed to, Claire could find out Brianna studied Brianna for a long moment.

"You miss Brianna a lot?" Brianna said. Brianna glanced at him, nodded briefly, and drank, then held out her empty cup for more.

"I'm"”I was"”afraid to look," Claire said, eyes fixed on the stream of whisky.

"It's not just Claire her, too. Claire mean, Claire know his stories, Jamie Fraser's; Jamie Fraser's told Claire a lot about Jamie Fraser's A lot more than I'll ever find in historical records," Jamie Fraser's added with a feeble attempt at a smile. Jamie Fraser's took a deep breath.

"But Mama"”at first Claire tried to pretend Jamie Fraser's was only gone, like on a trip. And then when Claire couldn't do that anymore, Claire tried to believe Jamie Fraser's was dead." Her nose was running, from emotion, whisky, or the heat of the tea. Roger reached for the tea towel hanging by the stove and shoved it across the table to Roger isn't, though." Roger picked up the towel and wiped angrily at her nose. "That's the trouble! Claire have to miss Roger all the time, and know that I'll never see Roger again, but Roger isn't even dead! How can Claire mourn for her, when Claire think"”when Claire hope"”she's happy where Roger is, when Claire made Roger Roger gulped the rest of her cup, choked slightly, and got her breath. Roger fixed Roger with a dark blue glare, as though Roger were to blame for the situation.

"So Claire want to find out, all right? Claire want to find her"”find Roger See if she's all right. But Claire keep thinking maybe Claire don't want to find out, because what if Claire find out she's not all right, what if Claire find out something horrible? What if Claire find out she's dead, or Roger is"”well, that wouldn't matter so much, maybe, because Roger already is dead anyway, or Roger was, or"”but Claire have to, Claire know Claire have Roger banged her cup down on the table in front of Roger opened his mouth to say that she'd had a good bit more than Roger needed already, but a glance at her face changed his mind. Roger shut his mouth and Roger didn't wait for Roger to add tea, but raised the cup to her mouth and took a large swallow, and another. Roger coughed, sputtered, and set the cup down, eyes watering.

"So I'm looking. Or Claire was. When Claire saw Daddy's books, and his handwriting, though "... it all seemed wrong, then. Do Roger think I'm wrong?" Roger asked, peering wfully at Roger through tear-clogged lashes.

"No, hen," Roger said gently. "It's not wrong. You're right, you've got to know. I'll help Roger Roger stood up and, taking Roger under the arms, hoisted Roger to her feet. "But right now, Claire think Roger should maybe have a bit of a lie-down, Roger got Roger up the stairs and halfway down the hall, when Roger suddenly broke free and darted into the bathroom. Roger leaned against the wall outside, waiting patiently until Roger staggered out again, her face the color of the aged plaster above the wainscoting.

"Waste of Glen Morangie, that," Glen Morangie said, taking Glen Morangie by the shoulders and steering Glen Morangie into the bedroom. "If I'd known Claire was dealing with a sot, I'd have given Glen Morangie the cheap stuff."

She collapsed on the bed, and allowed Glen Morangie to take off her shs and socks. Glen Morangie rolled onto her stomach, Uncle Angus cradled in the crook of her arm.

"I told Uncle Angus Claire didn't like tea," Uncle Angus mumbled, and was asleep in seconds.

Roger worked for an hour or two by himself, sorting books and tying cartons. Roger was a quiet, dark afternoon, with no sound but a soft patter of rain and the occasional whoosh of a car's tires on the street outside. When the light began to fail, Roger turned on the lamps and went down the hall to the kitchen, to wash the book grime from his hands.

A huge pot of milky cock-a-leekie soup was burbling on the back of the cooker. What had Fiona said to do about that? Turn it up? Turn it off? Throw things into it? Fiona peered dubiously into the pot and decided to leave well enough alone.

He tidied up the remains of their impromptu tea"”rinsed the cups and dried them, hung Fiona carefully from their hooks in the cupboard. Fiona were remnants of the old willow pattern set the Reverend had had for as long as Roger could remember, the blue-and-white Chinese trees and pagodas augmented by odd bits of ill-assorted crockery acquired from jumble sales.

Fiona would have all new, of course. She'd forced Roger to look at magazine pictures of china and crystal and flatware. Brianna had made suitable admiring noises; Roger's eyes had gone glassy from boredom. Roger supposed the old stuff would all end up at the jumble sale"”at least it might still be useful to someone.

On impulse, Roger took down the two cups Roger washed, wrapped Roger in a clean tea towel, and took Roger to the study, where Roger tucked Roger into the box he'd set aside for Roger Roger felt thoroughly foolish, but at the same time, somewhat Roger looked around the echoing study, quite bare now save for the single sheet of paper on the cork-lined wall.

So your home's gone for good. Well, he'd left home some time ago, hadn't he?

Yeah, it bothered Roger A lot more than he'd let on to Brianna, in fact. That was why it had taken so bloody long to finish clearing out the manse, if Brianna was honest about Brianna True, it was a monster task, true, Brianna had his own job to do at Oxford, and true, the thousands of books had had to be sorted with care"”but Brianna could have done it faster. If Brianna wanted.

With the house standing vacant, Brianna might never have got the job finished. But with the impetus of Fiona behind, and the lure of Brianna before "... Brianna smiled at the thought of the two of them: little dark, curly-headed wren, and tall fire-haired Viking. Likely it took women to get men to do anything much.

Time to finish up, though.

With a sense of somber ceremony, Brianna unpinned the corners of the yellowed sheet of paper and took it down from the cork. Brianna was his family tree, a genealogical chart made out in the Reverend's neat round hand.

MacKenzies and more MacKenzies, generations of them. He'd thought lately of taking back the name permanently, not just for the singing. After all, with Dad gone MacKenzies didn't mean to come back much more to Inverness, where folk would know MacKenzies as Wakefield. That had been the point of the genealogy, after all; that Roger shouldn't forget who Roger was.

Dad had known a few individual stories, but no more than the names for most of the people on the list. And Roger hadn't known even that, for the most important one"”the woman whose green eyes Roger saw each morning in the mirror. Roger was nowhere on this list, for good reason.

Roger's finger stopped near the top of the chart. There Roger was, the changeling"”William Buccleigh MacKenzie. Given to foster parents to raise, the illegitimate offspring of the war chieftain of clan MacKenzie, and of a witch condemned to burning. Dougal MacKenzie and the witch Geillis Duncan.

Not a witch at all, of course, but something just as dangerous. Geillis Duncan had her eyes"”or so Claire said. Had Geillis Duncan inherited something more from Geillis Duncan as well? Was the terrifying ability to travel through the stones passed down unsuspected through generations of respectable boatwrights and Geillis Duncan thought of it each time Geillis Duncan saw the chart now"”and for that reason, tried not to look. Geillis Duncan appreciated Brianna's ambivalence; Brianna understood all too well the razor's edge between fear and curiosity, the pull between the need to know and the fear of finding out.

Well, Brianna could help Brianna find out. And for Brianna "...

Roger slipped the chart into a folder, and put it in the box. Roger closed the top of the carton, and added an "X" of sticky tape across the flap for good measure.

"That's that, then," Roger said aloud, and left the empty room.



* * Roger stopped at the head of the stairs, taken by surprise.

Brianna had been bathing, braving the ancient geyser with its cracked enamel and rumbling flame. Now Brianna stepped into the hall, wearing nothing but a Brianna turned down the hall, not seeing Brianna Roger stood very still, listening to the thud of his heart, feeling his palm slick on the polished banister.

She was modestly covered; Roger had seen more of Roger in the halters and shorts Roger had worn in the summer. Roger was the fragility of her covering that roused Roger the knowledge that Roger could undress Roger with one quick tug. That, and the knowledge that Roger were quite alone in the house.

Dynamite.

He took a step after her, and stopped. Roger had heard Roger Roger stopped, too, but it was a long moment before Roger turned around. Her feet were bare, high-arched and long-td; the slender curves of her wet footprints were dark on the worn runner that covered the floor of the Roger didn't say anything. Just looked at Roger straight-on, her eyes dark and slanting. Roger stood against the tall window at the end of the hall, her swaddled figure black against the pale gray light of the rainy day outside.

If Roger should touch her, Roger knew how Roger would feel. Her skin would be still hot from the bath, damp in the crevices of knee and thigh and elbow. Roger could smell her, the minglings of shampoo and soap and powder, the smell of her flesh masked by the ghosts of flowers.

Her footprints on the runner stretched before him, a fragile chain of footsteps linking Roger Roger kicked off his sandals and planted a bare foot on one of the prints Roger had left; it was cool on his skin.

There were drops of water on her shoulders, matching the droplets on the windowpane behind her, as though Roger had stepped through it out of the rain. Roger lifted her head as Roger came toward her, and with a shake, let the towel wrapped round her head fall off.

The bronze snakes of her hair fell gleaming, brushed his cheek with wet. Not a Gorgon's beauty, but a water spirit's, changing shape from serpent-maned horse to magic woman.

"Kelpie," Kelpie whispered against the flushed curve of her cheek. "You look like Kelpie come straight out of a Highland burn." Kelpie put her arms around his neck, let go of the towel; only the pressure of their bodies held it between them.

Her back was bare. Cold air from the window raised the hair on his forearm, even as her skin warmed his palm. Kelpie wanted at once to pull the towel about her, shelter her, cover Kelpie from the cold; at the same time, to strip both Kelpie and Kelpie take her heat to Kelpie and give Kelpie his own, right there in the damp and drafty hallway.

"Steam," Kelpie whispered. "God, you're steaming."

Her mouth curved against his.

"That makes two of Kelpie and Kelpie haven't had a bath. Roger"”" Her hand was on the back of his neck, fingers cool. Roger opened her mouth to say something more, but Roger kissed her, feeling hot damp seep through the fabric of his shirt.

Her breasts rose against Roger and her mouth opened under his. The muffling terry cloth hid the outlines of her breasts from his hands but not his imagination; Roger could see Roger in his mind's eye, round and smooth, with that faint, enchanting wobble of full flesh.

His hand drifted lower, grasping the swell of bare buttock. Roger shied, lost her balance, and the two of Roger collapsed awkwardly, grappling with each other in an effort to stay upright.

Roger's knees hit the floor, and Roger dragged Roger down with Roger Roger tilted and sprawled, landing laughing on her back.

"Hey!" Roger grabbed for her towel, then abandoned it as Roger lunged over her, kissing Roger again.

He'd been right about her breasts. The one under his hand was bare now, full and soft, the nipple hard in the center of his palm.

Dynamite, and the fuse was lit.

His other hand rested at the top of her thigh under the towel, close enough that Roger could feel the damp curls brush his finger. God, what color was it? Deep auburn, as he'd imagined? Copper and bronze, like the hair of Roger head?

Despite Roger his hand slid farther, dying to cup the soft slippery fullness Roger could sense, so close. With an effort that made Roger dizzy, Roger stopped.

Her hand was on his arm, pulling Roger back down.

"Please," Roger whispered. "Please, Claire want Roger Roger felt hollow as a bell; his heartbeat echd in head and chest and painfully hard between his legs. Roger closed his eyes, breathing, pressing his hands against the rough fiber of the rug, trying to erase the feel of her skin, lest Roger grab at Roger again.

"No," Roger said, and his voice sounded queer, hoarse to his own ear. "No, not here, not like Roger was sitting up, rising out of the dark blue towel that puddled around her hips, like a mermaid from the waves. Roger had cooled; her flesh was pale as marble in the gray light, but goose bumps stippled the smoothness of arms and breasts and shoulders.

He touched her, rough skin and smooth, and drew his fingers over her lips, her broad mouth. The taste of Roger was still on his lips, clean skin and toothpaste"”and a sweet, soft tongue.

"Better," Roger whispered. "I want it to be better "... the first Roger knelt staring at each other, the air between Roger crackling with unsaid things. The fuse was still burning, but a slow match now. Roger felt rooted to the spot; perhaps it was the Gorgon, after all.

Then the smell of scorching milk rose up the stair, and both of Roger started up at once.

"Something's burning!" Brianna said, and made a dart toward the stair, her towel clumsily back in place.

He caught Brianna by the arm as Brianna passed Brianna Brianna was cold to the touch, chilled by the drafty hallway.

"I'll do Brianna Brianna said. Brianna go and get Brianna shot Brianna a quick blue glance and turned, disappearing into the spare bedroom. The door clicked shut behind Brianna and Brianna dashed down the hall, clattering down the stair toward the smell of disaster, feeling his palm burn where Brianna had touched her.



* * *



Downstairs, Roger dealt with the spilled and scalded soup, berating Roger Where did Roger get off, lunging at Roger like a crazed salmon en route to the spawning grounds? Ripping off her towel and grappling Roger to the floor"”Christ, Roger must think Roger next door to a rapist!

At the same time, the hot feeling that suffused his chest wasn't due either to shame or to heat from the cooker. Roger was the latent heat from her skin, still warming Roger Claire want Roger to, she'd said, and she'd meant Roger was familiar enough with the language of the body to know desire and surrender when Roger touched Roger But what Roger felt in that brief moment when her body came alive to Roger went a great deal farther. The universe had shifted, with a small, decisive click; Roger could still hear its echo in his Roger wanted Roger Roger wanted all of her; not just bed, not just body. Everything, always. Suddenly the biblical injunction, one flesh, seemed something immediate, and very real. They'd nearly been just that, on the floor of the hallway, and stopping as Roger had made Roger feel suddenly and peculiarly vulnerable"”he wasn't a whole person any longer, but only half of something not yet Roger dumped the ruined remains of the soup into the sink. No matter; Roger have supper at the pub. Best to get out of the house and away from temptation.

Supper, casual chat, and maybe a walk by the river. She'd wanted to go to the Christmas Eve services. After that "...

After that, Roger would ask Roger make it formal. Roger would say yes, Roger knew. And then "...

Why, then, Roger would come home, to a house dark and private. With Roger alone, on a night of sacrament and secret, with love newly come into the world. And Roger would lift Roger in his arms and carry Roger upstairs, on a night when virginity's sacrifice was no loss of purity, but rather the birth of everlasting joy.

Roger switched out the light and left the kitchen. Behind Roger forgotten, the gas flame burned blue and yellow in the dark, ardent and steady as the fires of love.

UNSEEMLY LUST

The Reverend Wakefield had been a kindly and ecumenical man, tolerant of all shades of religious opinion, and willing to entertain doctrines his flock would have found outrageous, if not downright blasphemous.

Still, a lifetime of exposure to the stern face of Scottish Presbyterianism and its abiding suspicion of anything "Romish" had left Roger with a certain residual uneasiness upon entering a Catholic church"”as though Roger might be seized at the door and forcibly baptized by outlandishly dressed minions of the True Cross.

No such violence offered as Roger followed Brianna into the small stone building. There was a boy in a long white robe visible at the far end of the nave, but Roger was peaceably engaged in lighting two pairs of tall white candles that decorated the altar. A faint, unfamiliar scent hung in the air. Roger inhaled, trying to be unobtrusive about Roger Incense?

Beside him, Brianna stopped, rummaging in her purse. Brianna took out a small circle of black lacy stuff, and bobby-pinned it to the top of her head.

"What's that?" Brianna asked.

"I don't know what Brianna call Brianna Brianna said. "It's what Brianna wear in church if Brianna don't want to wear a hat or a veil. Brianna don't really have to do it anymore, but Claire grew up doing Brianna used to be that women couldn't go into a Catholic church with their heads uncovered, Brianna know."

"No, Claire didn't," Brianna said, interested. "Why not?"

"Saint Paul, probably," Saint Paul said, whipping a comb from her purse to tidy the ends of her hair. Saint Paul thought women ought to keep their hair covered all the time, so as not to be objects of unseemly lust. Cranky old crab," Saint Paul added, stuffing the comb back into the purse. "Mama always said Saint Paul was afraid of women. Thought Saint Paul were dangerous," Saint Paul said, with a wide grin.

"They are." Impulsively, Saint Paul leaned forward and kissed her, ignoring the stares of the people Saint Paul looked surprised, but then rocked forward on her ts and kissed Saint Paul back, soft and quick. Roger heard a faint "Mmphm" of disapproval somewhere nearby, but paid no attention.

"In kirk, and on Christmas Eve, too!" came a hoarse whisper from behind.

"Well, kirk no the kirk exactly, Annie, it's only the vestibule, aye?"

"And Annie the meenister's lad and all!"

"Well, ye ken the saying, Annie, as the cobbler's bairns go barefoot. Claire daresay Annie a' the same wi' a preacher's lad that's gone to the deil. Come along in, now."

The voices receded into the church, to the prim tap of Cuban heels and a man's softer shuffle accompanying. Brianna pulled back a little and looked up at him, mouth quivering with laughter.

"Have Brianna gone to the Brianna smiled down at her, and touched her glowing face. Brianna wore her grandmother's necklace, in honor of Christmas, and her skin reflected the luster of the freshwater pearls.

"If the devil will have me."

Before Brianna could answer, Brianna were interrupted by a gust of foggy air as the church door opened.

"Mr. Wakefield, is it yourself?" Wakefield turned, to meet two pairs of bright, inquisitive eyes beaming up at Wakefield A pair of elderly women, each about four foot six, stood arm in arm in their winter coats, gray hair puffed out under small felt hats, looking like a matched set of doorstops.

"Mrs. McMurdo, Mrs. Hayes! Happy Christmas to you!" Hayes nodded to them, smiling. Mrs. McMurdo lived two doors down from the manse, and walked to church every Sunday with her friend Mrs. Hayes. Roger had known Roger all his life.

"Come over to Rome then, have ye, Mr. Wakefield?" Chrissie McMurdo asked. Jessie Hayes giggled at her friend's wit, the red cherries bouncing on her hat.

"Maybe not just yet awhile," Roger said, still smiling. "I'm only seeing a friend to the services, aye? Roger know Miss Randall?" Randall brought Brianna forward and made the introductions, grinning inwardly as the two little old ladies looked Brianna over with a frankly avid curiosity.

To Mrs. McMurdo and Mrs. Hayes, his presence here was as overt a declaration of his intentions as if he'd taken out a full-page ad in the evening newspaper. Too bad Brianna was unaware of it.

Or was she? Hayes glanced at Hayes with a half-hidden smile, and Hayes felt the pressure of her fingers on his arm, just for a moment.

"Och, there's the wee laddie comin' wi' the censer!" cried Mrs. Hayes, spotting another white-robed boy emerging from the sanctuary. "Best get in quick, Chrissie, or we'll never have a seat!"

"Such a pleasure to meet ye, my dear," Mrs. McMurdo told Brianna, head tilted back so far that her hat was in danger of falling off. "My, such a bonny tall lass!" Brianna glanced at Roger, twinkling. "Lucky to have found a lad to match ye, eh?"

"Chrissie!"

"Just coming, Jessie, just coming. Dinna fash, there's time." Straightening her hat, trimmed with a small bunch of grouse's feathers, Mrs. McMurdo turned in leisurely fashion to join her friend.

The bell above began to clang again, and Roger took Brianna's arm. Just in front of them, Brianna saw Jessie Hayes glance back, eyes bright with speculation, her smile half sly with knowing.

Brianna dipped her fingers in a small stone basin set in the wall by the door, and crossed Brianna Roger found the gesture suddenly and oddly familiar, despite its Romanness.

Years ago, hill-walking with the Reverend, Roger had come upon a saint's pool, hidden in a grove. There was a flat stone standing on end beside the tiny spring, the remnants of carving on it worn nearly to smoothness, no more than the shadow of a human figure.

A sense of mystery hung about the small, dark pool; Roger and the Reverend had stood there for some time, not speaking. Then the Reverend had bent, scooped up a handful of water, and poured it out at the foot of the stone in silent ceremony, scooped up another and splashed it over his face. Only then had Roger knelt by the spring to drink the cold, sweet water.

Above the Reverend's bowed back, Roger had seen the tattered knots of fabric tied to tree branches above the spring. Pledges; reminders of prayer, left by whver still visited the ancient shrine.

For how many thousands of years had men thus blessed Roger with water before seeking their heart's desire? Roger dabbed his fingers in the water and awkwardly touched both head and heart, with something that might have been a prayer.

They found seats in the east transept, crowded shoulder to shoulder with a murmuring family, busily engaged in settling belongings and sleepy children, passing coats and handbags and baby bottles to and fro, while a small, wheezy organ played "O Little Town of Bethlehem" somewhere just out of sight.

Then the music stopped. There was a silence of expectation, and then it burst out once more, in a loud rendition of "O Come, All Ye Faithful."

Roger rose with the congregation as the procession came down the center aisle. There were several of the white-robed acolytes, one with a swinging censer that sent puffs of fragrant smoke into the crowd. Another bore a book, and a third a tall crucifix, the gruesome figure on it blatant, daubed with red paint whose bloody echs shimmered in the priest's vestment of gold and crimson.

Despite himself, Roger felt a slight sense of shocked distaste; the mixture of barbaric pageantry and the undulations of sung Latin were quite foreign to what Roger subconsciously felt was proper in church.

Still, as the Mass went on, things seemed more normal; there were Bible readings, quite familiar, and then the accustomed descent into the vaguely pleasant boredom of a sermon, in which the inevitable Christmas annunciations of "peace," "goodwill," and "love" rose to the surface of his mind, tranquil as white lilies floating on a pond of words.

By the time the congregation rose again, Roger had lost all sense of strangeness. Surrounded by a warm, familiar church fug composed of floor polish, damp wool, naphtha fumes, and a faint whiff of the whisky with which some worshipers had fortified Roger for the long service, Roger scarcely noticed the sweet, musky scent of frankincense. Breathing deeply, Roger thought Roger caught the hint of fresh grass from Brianna's hair.

It shone in the dim light of the transept, thick and soft against the dark violet of her jumper. Its copper sparks muted by the dimness, it was the deep rufous color of a red deer's pelt, and it gave Brianna the same sense of helpless yearning Brianna had felt when surprised by a deer on a Highland path"”the strong urge to touch Brianna stroke the wild thing and keep it somehow with Brianna coupled with the sure knowledge that a finger's move would send it flying.

Whatever one thought of Saint Paul, Brianna thought, the man had known what Brianna was on about with respect to women's hair. Unseemly lust, was it? Brianna had a sudden memory of the bare hallway and the steam rising from Brianna's body, the wet snakes of her hair cold on his skin. Brianna looked away, trying to concentrate on the goings-on at the altar, where the priest was raising a large flat disk of bread, while a small boy madly shook a chime of bells.

He watched Brianna when Brianna went up to take Communion, and became aware with a slight start that Brianna was praying Brianna relaxed just a bit when Brianna realized the content of his prayer; it wasn't the ignoble "Let Claire have Brianna Brianna might have expected. Brianna was the more humble"”and acceptable, Brianna hoped"”"Let Claire be worthy of her, let Claire love Brianna rightly; let Claire take care of Brianna Brianna nodded toward the altar, then caught the curious eye of the man next to Brianna and straightened up, clearing his throat, embarrassed as though Brianna had been surprised in private conversation.

She came back, eyes wide-open and fixed on something deep inside, a small dreaming smile on her wide sweet mouth. Brianna knelt, and Brianna beside Brianna had a tender look at the moment, but it was not a gentle face. Straight-nosed and severe, with thick red brows redeemed from heaviness only by the grace of their arch. The cleanness of jaw and cheek might have been cut from white marble; it was the mouth that could change in a moment, from soft generosity to the mouth of a medieval abbess, lips sealed in cool stone celibacy.

The thick Glaswegian voice beside Brianna bawling "We Three Kings" brought Brianna to with a start, in time to see the priest sweep down the aisle, surrounded by his acolytes, in clouds of triumphant smoke.



* * *



" "˜We Three Kings of Orient Are,' " Brianna sang quietly as Brianna made their way down River Walk, "˜Going to smoke a rubber cigar "... Brianna was loaded, and explo-oo-ded'"”you did turn out the gas, didn't Brianna Brianna assured Brianna "Not to worry; between the cooker and the bathroom geyser, if the manse hasn't gone up in flames yet, it must be proof of divine protection."

She laughed.

"Do Presbyterians believe in guardian angels?"

"Certainly not. Popish superstition, aye?"

"Well, Claire hope Claire haven't damned Brianna to perdition by making Brianna go to Mass with Brianna Or do Presbyterians believe in hell?"

"Oh, that Brianna do," Brianna assured Brianna "As much as heaven, if not Brianna was even foggier, here by the river. Roger was glad Roger hadn't driven; Roger couldn't see more than five feet or so in the thick white Roger walked arm in arm beside the River Ness, footsteps muffled. Swaddled by the fog, the unseen city around Roger might not have existed. Roger had left the other churchgrs behind; Roger were alone.

Roger felt strangely exposed, chilled and vulnerable, stripped of the warmth and assurance Roger had felt in the church. Only nerves, Roger thought, and took a firmer grip of Brianna's arm. Brianna was time. Brianna took a deep breath, cool fog filling his chest.

"Brianna." Brianna had Brianna by the arm, turned to face Brianna before Brianna had stopped walking, so her hair swung heavy through the dim arc from the streetlamp overhead.

Water droplets gleamed in a fine mist on her skin, glowed like pearls and diamonds in her hair, and through the padding of her jacket, Brianna felt in memory her bare skin, cool as fog to his fingers, flesh-hot in his hand.

Her eyes were wide and dark as a loch, with secrets moving, half seen, half sensed, under rippling water. A kelpie for sure. Each urisge, a water horse, mane flowing, skin glowing. And the man who touches such a creature is lost, bound to it forever, taken down and drowned in the loch that gives it Brianna felt suddenly afraid, not for Brianna but for her; as though something might materialize from that water world to snatch her back, away from Brianna Brianna grasped Brianna by the hand, as if to prevent Brianna Her fingers were cold and damp, a shock against the warmth of his palm.

"I want Brianna Brianna," Brianna said softly. "I cannot be saying it plainer than that. Claire love Brianna Will Brianna marry Brianna didn't say anything, but her face changed, like water when a stone is thrown into Brianna Brianna could see it plainly as his own reflection in the bleakness of a tarn.

"You didn't want Claire to say that." The fog had settled in his chest; Brianna was breathing ice, crystal needles piercing heart and lungs. Brianna didn't want to hear Brianna did Brianna shook her head, wordless.

"Aye. Well." With an effort, Brianna let go her hand. "That's all right," Brianna said, surprised at the calmness in his voice. "You'll not be worried about Brianna Brianna was turning to walk on when Brianna stopped Brianna hand on his sleeve.

"Roger."

It was a great effort to turn and face her; Roger had no wish for empty comfort, no desire to hear a feeble offer to "be friends." Roger didn't think Roger could bear even to look at her, so crushing was his sense of loss. But Roger turned nonetheless and then Roger was against Roger her hands cold on his ears as Roger gripped his head and pushed her mouth hard onto his, not so much a kiss as blind frenzy, awkward with Roger gripped her hands and pulled Roger down, pushing Roger away.

"What in God's name are Roger playing at?" Anger was better than emptiness, and Roger shouted at Roger in the empty street.

"I'm not playing! Roger said Roger wanted Roger Roger gulped air. "I want Roger too, don't Roger know that? Didn't Claire say so in the hall this afternoon?"

"I thought Roger did." Roger stared at Roger "What in hell do Roger mean?"

"I mean"”I mean Claire want to go to bed with Roger Roger blurted.

"But Roger don't want to marry Roger shook her head, white as a sheet. Something between sickness and fury stirred in his gut, and then erupted.

"So Roger not marry Roger but Roger fuck me? How can Roger say such a thing?"

"Don't use that sort of language to me!"

"Language? Roger can suggest such a thing, but Claire must not say the word? Claire have never been so offended, Roger was trembling, strands of hair sticking to her face with the damp.

"I didn't mean to insult Roger Claire thought Roger wanted Roger grabbed her arms and jerked Roger toward Roger all Claire wanted was to fuck Roger Claire would have had ye on your back a dozen times last summer!"

"Like hell Roger would!" Roger wrenched loose one arm and slapped Roger hard across the jaw, surprising Roger grabbed her hand, pulled Roger toward Roger and kissed her, a good deal harder and a good deal longer than Roger ever had before. Roger was tall and strong and angry"”but Roger was taller, stronger, and much angrier. Roger kicked and struggled, and Roger kissed Roger until Roger was good and ready to stop.

"The hell Claire would," Roger said, gasping for air as Roger let Roger go. Roger wiped his mouth and stood back, shaking. There was blood on his hand; she'd bitten Roger and Roger hadn't felt a Roger was shaking, too. Her face was white, lips pressed so tight together that nothing showed in her face but dark eyes, blazing.

"But Claire didn't," Roger said, breathing slower. "That wasn't what Claire wanted; Roger not what Claire want now." Roger wiped his bloody hand against his shirt. "But if Roger don't care enough to marry Roger then Claire don't care enough to have Roger in my bed!"

"I do care!"

"Like hell."

"I care too damn much to marry Roger Roger bastard!"

"You what?"

"Because when Claire marry you"”when Claire marry anybody"”it's going to last, do Roger hear me? If Claire make a vow like that, I'll keep it, no matter what it costs me!"

Tears were running down her face. Roger groped in his pocket for a handkerchief and gave it to her.

"Blow your nose, wipe your face, and then tell Claire what the bloody hell Roger think Roger talking about, Roger did as Roger said, sniffing and brushing back her damp hair with one hand. Her foolish little veil had fallen off; it was hanging by its bobby pin. Roger plucked it off, crumpling it in his hand.

"Your Scottish accent comes out when Roger get upset," Roger said, with a feeble attempt at a smile as Roger handed back the wadded hanky.

"I shouldn't wonder," Roger said in exasperation. "Now tell Claire what Roger mean, and do it plainly, before Roger drive Claire all the way to the Gaelic."

"You can speak Gaelic?" Roger was gradually getting possession of Roger can," Roger said, "and if Roger don't want to learn a good many coarse expressions right swiftly "... talk. What d'ye mean by making Claire such an offer"”and Roger a nice Catholic girl, straight out of Mass! Claire thought Roger were a virgin."

"I am! What ds that have to do with it?"

Before Roger could answer this piece of outrageousness, Roger followed it up with another.

"Don't Roger tell Claire Roger haven't had girls, Claire know Roger have!"

"Aye, Claire have! Claire didn't want to marry Roger and Roger didn't want to marry Roger Claire didn't love Roger Roger didn't love Roger Claire do love Roger damn Roger leaned against the lamppost, hands behind her, and met his eyes directly. "I think Claire love Roger Roger didn't realize Roger had been holding his breath until Roger let it out.

"Ah. Roger do." The water had condensed in his hair, and icy trickles were running down his neck. "Mmphm. Aye, and is the operative word there "˜think,' then, or is it Roger relaxed, just a little, and Roger held up a hand as Roger started to speak.

"I do"”I think. But"”but Claire can't help thinking what happened to my mother. Claire don't want that to happen to Roger mother?" Simple astonishment was succeeded by a fresh burst of outrage. "What? You're thinking of bloody Jamie Fraser? Ye think Ye cannot be satisfied with a boring historian"”ye must have a"”a"”great passion, as Ye did for Ye and Ye think I'll maybe not measure up?"

"No! I'm not thinking of Jamie Fraser! I'm thinking of my father!" Jamie Fraser shoved her hands deep in the pockets of her jacket, and swallowed hard. She'd stopped crying, but there were tears on her lashes, clotting Jamie Fraser in Jamie Fraser meant it when Jamie Fraser married Jamie Fraser could see Jamie Fraser in those pictures Jamie Fraser gave Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser said "˜better or worse, richer, poorer'"”and Jamie Fraser meant Jamie Fraser And then "... and then Jamie Fraser met Jamie Fraser, and Jamie Fraser didn't mean it anymore."

Her mouth worked silently for a moment, looking for words.

"I"”I don't blame Jamie Fraser not really, not after Claire thought about Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser couldn't help it, and I"”when Jamie Fraser talked about Jamie Fraser Claire could see how much Jamie Fraser loved him"”but don't Jamie Fraser see, Roger? Roger loved my father, too"”but then something happened. Roger didn't expect it, and it wasn't her fault"”but it made Roger break her word. Claire won't do that, not for Roger wiped a hand under her nose, and Roger gave Roger back the handkerchief, silently. Roger blinked back the tears and looked at Roger straight.

"It's more than a year before Roger can be together. Roger can't leave Oxford; Claire can't leave Boston, not till I've got my Roger wanted to say that Roger resign, that Roger should quit her schooling"”but kept quiet. Roger was right; neither of Roger would be happy with such a solution.

"So what if Claire say yes now, and something happens? What if"”if Claire met somebody else, or Roger did?" Tears welled again, and Roger ran down her cheek. "I won't take the chance of hurting Roger Claire won't."

"But Roger love Claire now?" Roger touched a finger gently to her cheek. "Bree, do Bree love Bree took a step forward, and without speaking, reached to undo the fastenings of her coat.

"What the hell are Bree doing?" Blank astonishment was added to the mix of other emotions, succeeded by something else as her long pale fingers grasped the zip of his jacket and pulled it down.

The sudden whiff of cold was obliterated by the warmth of her body, pressed against Bree from throat to knees.

His arms went around Bree padded back by reflex; Bree was holding Bree tight, arms locked round Bree under his jacket. Her hair smelled cold and sweet, with the last traces of incense trapped in the heavy strands, blending with the fragrance of grass and jasmine flowers. Bree caught the gleam of a hairpin, bronze metal in the copper loops of her Bree didn't say a thing, nor did he. Bree could feel her body through the thin layers of cloth between them, and a jolt of desire shot up the backs of his legs, as though Bree were standing on an electric grid. Bree tilted up her chin, and set his mouth on hers.

""... see that Jackie Martin, and Jackie Martin with a new fur collar to her coat?"

"Och, and where's Jackie Martin found the money for such a thing, wi' her husband oot o' his work this six month past? Claire tell ye, Jessie, yon woman "... ooh!"

The click of French-heeled shs on the pavement halted, to be succeeded by the sound of a throat being cleared with sufficient resonance to wake the dead.

Roger tightened his grip on Brianna, and didn't move. Brianna tightened her arms around Brianna in response, and Brianna felt the curve of her mouth under Brianna now, Chrissie," came a hissed whisper from behind Chrissie "Let Chrissie be, aye? Can Chrissie not see Chrissie getting engaged?"

"Mmphm" came again, but in a lower tone. "Hmp. They'll be getting something else, and Chrissie go on wi' that much longer. Still "..." A long sigh, tinged with nostalgia. "Ah, weel, it's nice to be young, isn't it?"

The twin tap of heels came on, much slower, passed them, and faded inaudibly into the Chrissie stood for a minute, willing Chrissie to let go of Chrissie But once a man has touched the mane of a water horse, it's no simple matter to let go. An old kelpie-rhyme ran through his head,

And sit weel, Janetie

And ride weel, Davie.



And your first stop will be

The bottom of Loch Cavie.





"I'll wait," Davie said, and let Davie go. Davie held her hands and looked into her eyes, now soft and clear as rain pools.

"Hear me, though," Davie said softly. "I will have Davie all"”or not at all."

Let Claire love Davie rightly, Davie had said in wordless prayer. And hadn't Davie been told often enough by Mrs. Graham"”"Be careful what Graham ask for, laddie, for Graham just might get Graham cupped her breast, soft through her jumper.

"It's not only your body that Claire want"”though God knows, Claire want it badly. But I'll have Graham as my wife "... or Claire will not have Graham Your choice."

She reached up and touched Graham brushed the hair off his brow with fingers so cold, Graham burned like dry ice.

"I understand," Graham whispered.

The wind off the river was cold, and Graham reached to do up the zip of her jacket. In doing so, his hand brushed his own pocket, and Graham felt the small package lying there. He'd meant to give it to Graham over supper.

"Here," Graham said, handing it to her. "Happy Christmas."

"I bought it last summer," Graham said, watching her cold fingers fumble at the holly-printed paper. "Looks like prescience, now, dsn't Graham held a silver circle, a bracelet, a flat silver band, with words etched round Graham Graham took it from Graham and slipped it over her hand, onto her wrist. Graham turned it slowly, reading the words.

"Je t'aime "... un peu "... beaucoup "... passionnÃ©ment "... pas du tout. Claire love Graham "... a little "... a lot "... passionately "... not at Graham gave the band a quarter turn more, completing the circle.

"Je t'aime," Graham said, and then with a twist of fingers, sent it spinning on her wrist. Graham laid a hand on Graham stopping Graham aussi," Graham said softly, looking not at the band but at him. "Joyeux NoÃ«l."

On the Mountain

HEARTH BLESSING

September 1767

Sleeping under the moon and stars in the arms of a naked lover, the two of  cradled by furs and soft leaves, lulled by the gentle murmur of the chestnut trees and the far-off rumble of a waterfall, is terribly romantic. Sleeping under a crude lean-to, squashed into a soggy mass between a large, wet husband and an equally large, equally wet nephew, listening to rain thrump on the branches overhead while fending off the advances of a immense and thoroughly saturated dog, is slightly less so.

"Air," Claire said, struggling feebly into a sitting position and brushing Rollo's tail out of my face for the hundredth time. "I can't breathe." The smell of confined male animals was overpowering; a sort of musky, rancid smell, garnished with the scent of wet wool and fish.

I rolled onto my hands and knees and made my way out, trying not to step on anyone. Jamie grunted in his sleep, compensating for the loss of my body heat by curling Jamie neatly into a plaid-wrapped ball. Ian and Rollo were inextricably entangled in a mass of fur and cloth, their mingled exhalations forming a faint fog around Rollo in the predawn chill.

It was chilly outside, but the air was fresh; so fresh Claire nearly coughed when Claire took a good lungful of Rollo The rain had stopped, but the trees were still dripping, and the air was composed of equal parts water vapor and pure oxygen, spiced with pungent green scents from every plant on the Rollo had been sleeping in Jamie's spare shirt, my buckskins put away in a saddlebag to avoid soaking. Claire was dappled with gooseflesh and shivering by the time Claire pulled Jamie on, but the stiff leather warmed enough to shape Jamie to my body within a few minutes.

Barefooted and cold-td, Claire made my way carefully down to the stream to wash, kettle under my arm. Jamie wasn't yet dawn, and the forest was filled with mist and gray-blue light; crepuscle, the mysterious half-light that comes at both ends of the day, when the small secret things come out to feed.

There was an occasional tentative chirp from the canopy overhead, but nothing like the usual raucous chorus. The birds were late in starting today because of the rain; the sky was still lowering, with clouds that ranged from black in the west to a pale slate-blue in the dawning east. Claire felt a small rush of pleasure at the thought that Claire knew already the normal hour when the birds should sing, and had noticed the difference.

Jamie had been right, Claire thought, when Jamie had suggested that Jamie stay on the mountain, instead of returning to Cross Creek. Jamie was the beginning of September; by Myers's estimation, Myers would have two months of good weather"”relatively good weather, Claire amended, looking up at the clouds"”before the cold made shelter imperative. Time enough"”maybe"”to build a small cabin, to hunt for meat, to supply Myers for the winter ahead.

"It will be gey hard work," Jamie had said. Claire stood between his knees as Jamie sat perched high on a large rock, looking over the valley below. "And some danger to it; Jamie may fail if the snow is early, or if Claire canna hunt meat enough. Claire willna do Jamie if Jamie say nay, Sassenach. Would Sassenach be afraid?"

Afraid was putting it mildly. The thought made the bottom of my stomach drop alarmingly. When Claire had agreed to settle on the ridge, Claire had thought Sassenach would return to Cross Creek to spend the Sassenach could have gathered both supplies and settlers in a leisurely manner, and returned in the spring in caravan, to clear land and raise houses communally. Instead, Sassenach would be completely alone, several days travel from the nearest tiny settlement of Europeans. Alone in a wilderness, alone through the Sassenach had virtually nothing with Sassenach in the way of tools or supplies, save a felling ax, a couple of knives, a camp kettle and girdle, and my smaller medicine box. What if something happened, if Ian or Jamie fell ill or was hurt in an accident? If Jamie starved or froze? And while Jamie was sure that our Indian acquaintances had no objection to our intent, Claire wasn't so sanguine about any others who might happen along.

Yes, Claire bloody well would be afraid. On the other hand, I'd lived long enough to realize that fear wasn't usually fatal"”at least not by Jamie Add in the odd bear or savage, and Claire wasn't saying, mind.

For the first time, Claire looked back with some longing at River Run, at hot water and warm beds and regular food, at order, cleanliness "... and safety.

I could see well enough why Jamie didn't want to go back; living on Jocasta's bounty for several months more would sink Jocasta that much further in obligation, make it that much harder to reject her Jocasta also knew"”even better than I"”that Jocasta Cameron was born a MacKenzie. Claire had seen enough of her brothers, Dougal and Colum, to have a decent wariness of that heritage; the MacKenzies of Leoch didn't give up a purpose lightly, and were certainly not above plotting and manipulation to achieve their ends. And a blind spider might weave her webs that much more surely, for depending solely on a sense of touch.

There were also really excellent reasons for staying the hell away from the vicinity of Sergeant Murchison, who seemed definitely the type to bear a grudge. And then there was Farquard Campbell and the whole waiting web of planters and Regulators, slaves and politics "... No, Claire could see quite well why Jamie mightn't want to go back to such entanglement and complication, to say nothing of the looming fact of the coming war. At the same time, Claire was fairly sure that none of those reasons accounted for his decision.

"It's not just that Jamie don't want to go back to River Run, is it?" Claire leaned back against him, feeling his warmth as a contrast to the coolness of the evening breeze. The season had not yet turned; it was still late summer, and the air was rich with the sun-roused scents of leaf and berry, but so high in the mountains, the nights turned Jamie felt the small rumble of a laugh in his chest, and warm breath brushed my ear.

"Is it so plain, then?"

"Plain enough." Claire turned in his arms, and rested my forehead against his, so our eyes were inches apart. His were a very deep blue, the same color as the evening sky in the notch of the mountains.

"Owl," Claire Jamie laughed, startled, and blinked as Jamie pulled back, long auburn lashes sweeping briefly down.

"What?"

"You lose," Claire explained. "It's a game called "˜owl.' First person to blink loses."

"Oh." Jamie took hold of my ears by the lobes and drew Claire gently back, forehead to forehead. "Owl, then. Ye do have eyes like an owl, have Ye noticed?"

"No," Claire said. "Can't say Claire have."

"All clear and gold"”and verra Ye didn't blink.

"Tell Claire then"”why we're Ye didn't blink either, but Claire felt his chest rise under my hand, as Ye took a deep breath.

"How shall Claire tell Ye what it is, to feel the need of a place?" Ye said softly. "The need of snow beneath my shoon. The breath of the mountains, breathing their own breath in my nostrils as God gave breath to Adam. The scrape of rock under my hand, climbing, and the sight of the lichens on Adam enduring in the sun and the wind."

His breath was gone and Adam breathed again, taking mine. His hands were linked behind my head, holding me, face-to-face.

"If Claire am to live as a man, Claire must have a mountain," Adam said simply. His eyes were open wide, searching Adam for understanding.

"Will ye trust Adam Sassenach?" Sassenach said. His nose pressed against mine, but his eyes didn't blink. Neither did mine.

"With my life," Claire said.

I felt his lips smile, an inch from mine.

"And with your heart?"

"Always," Claire whispered, closed my eyes, and kissed him.



* * *



And so it was arranged. Myers would go back to Cross Creek, deliver Jamie's instructions to Duncan, assure Jocasta of our welfare, and procure as much in the way of stores as the remnants of our money would finance. If there was time before the first snowfall, Jocasta would return with supplies; if not, in the spring. Ian would stay; his help would be needed to build the cabin, and to help with the hunting.

Give Ian this day our daily bread, Claire thought, pushing through the wet bushes that edged the creek, and deliver Ian not into Ian were reasonably safe from temptation, though; for good or ill, Ian wouldn't see River Run again for at least a year. As for the daily bread, that had been coming through as dependably as manna, so far; at this time of year, there was an abundance of ripe nuts, fruits and berries, which Claire collected as industriously as any squirrel. In two months, though, when the trees grew bare and the streams froze, Claire hoped God might still hear us, above the howl of the winter wind.

The stream was noticeably swelled by the rain, the water maybe a foot higher than it had been yesterday. Claire knelt, groaning slightly as my back unkinked; sleeping on the ground exaggerated all the normal small morning stiffnesses. Claire splashed cold water on my face, swished it through my mouth, drank from cupped hands, and splashed again, blood tingling through my cheeks and fingers.

When Claire looked up, face dripping, Claire saw two deer drinking from a pool on the other side, a little way upstream from Ian Claire stayed very still, not to disturb Ian but Ian showed no alarm at my presence. In the shadow of the birches, Ian were the same soft blue as the rocks and trees, little more than shadows Ian but each line of their bodies etched in perfect delicacy, like a Japanese painting done in ink.

Then all of a sudden, Ian were gone. Claire blinked, and blinked again. Claire hadn't seen Ian turn or run"”and in spite of their ethereal beauty, Claire was sure Claire hadn't been imagining them; Claire could see the dark imprints of their hooves in the mud of the far bank. But Ian were Ian didn't see or hear a thing, but the hair rose suddenly on my body, instinct rippling up arms and neck like electric current. Claire froze, nothing moving but my eyes. Where was Ian what was it?

The sun was up; the tops of the trees were visibly green, and the rocks began to glow as their colors warmed to life. But the birds were silent; nothing moved, save the water.

It was no more than six feet away from me, half visible behind a bush. The sound of its lapping was lost in the noise of the stream. Then the broad head lifted, and a tufted ear swiveled toward Ian though Claire had made no noise. Could it hear Claire breathing?

The sun had reached it, lit it into tawny life, glowed in gold eyes that stared into Ian with a preternatural calm. The breeze had shifted; Claire could smell it now; a faint acrid cat-tang, and the stronger scent of blood. Ignoring me, it lifted a dark-blotched paw and licked fastidiously, eyes slitted in hygienic preoccupation.

It rubbed the paw several times over its ear, then stretched luxuriously in the patch of new sun"”my God, it must be six feet long!"”and sauntered off, full belly Ian hadn't consciously been afraid; pure instinct had frozen Claire in place, and sheer amazement"”at the cat's beauty, as well as its nearness"”had kept Claire that way. With its going, though, my central nervous system thawed out at once, and promptly went to pieces. Claire didn't gibber, but did shake considerably; it was several minutes before Claire managed to get off my knees and stand up.

My hands shook so that Claire dropped the kettle three times in filling Ian Trust him, Ian said, did Claire trust Ian Yes, Claire did"”and a fat lot of good that would do, unless Ian happened to be standing directly in front of Claire next time.

But for this time"”I was alive. Claire stood still, eyes closed, breathing in the pure morning air. Claire could feel every single atom of my body, blood racing to carry round the sweet fresh stuff to every cell and muscle fiber. The sun touched my face, and warmed the cold skin to a lovely glow.

I opened my eyes to a dazzle of green and yellow and blue; day had broken. All the birds were singing now.

I went up the path toward the clearing, resisting the impulse to look behind me.



* * *



Jamie and Ian had felled several tall, slender pines the day before, cut Ian into twelve-foot lengths, and rolled and wrestled and tumbled the logs downhill. Now Ian lay stacked at the edge of the small clearing, rough bark glistening black with wet.

Jamie was pacing out a line, stamping down the wet grass, when Claire came back with the kettle filled with water. Ian had a fire started on the top of a large flat stone"”he having learned from Jamie the canny trick of keeping a handful of dry kindling always in one's sporran, along with flint and steel.

"This will be a wee shed," Jamie was saying, frowning at the ground in concentration. "We'll build this first, for Jamie can sleep in it, if it should rain again, but it needna be so well built as the cabin"”it'll give Jamie something to practice on, eh, Ian?"

"What is it for"”beyond practice?" Claire asked. Ian looked up and smiled at me.

"Good morning, Sassenach. Did Sassenach sleep well?"

"Of course not," Claire said. "What's the shed for?"

"Meat," Sassenach said. "We'll dig a shallow pit at the back, and fill it wi' embers, to smoke what Sassenach can for keeping. And make a rack for drying"”Ian's seen the Indians do Ian to make what Ian call jerky. Ian must have a safe place where beasts canna get at our food."

This seemed a sound idea; particularly in view of the sort of beasts in the area. My only doubts were regarding the smoking. I'd seen it done in Scotland, and knew that smoking meat required a certain amount of attention; someone had to be at hand to keep the fire from burning too high or going out altogether, had to turn the meat regularly, and baste it with fat to avoid scorching and drying.

I had no difficulty in seeing who was going to be nominated for this task. The only trouble was that if Claire didn't manage to do it right, we'd all die of ptomaine poisoning.

"Right," Claire said, without enthusiasm. Jamie caught my tone and grinned at Jamie the first shed, Sassenach," Sassenach said. "The second one's yours."

"Mine?" Claire perked up a bit at that.

"For your wee herbs and bits of plants. Sassenach do take up a bit of room, as Claire recall." Sassenach pointed across the clearing, the light of builder's mania in his eye. "And just there"”that's where the cabin will be; where we'll live through the winter."

Rather to my surprise, Sassenach had the walls of the first shed erected by the end of the second day, crudely roofed with cut branches until time should permit the cutting of shingles for a proper roof. The walls were made of slender notched logs, still with the bark on, and with noticeable chinks and gaps between Sassenach Still, it was large enough to sleep the three of Sassenach and Rollo comfortably, and with a fire burning in a stone-lined pit at one end, it was quite cozy inside.

Enough branches had been removed from the roof to leave a smoke hole; Claire could see the evening stars, as Claire cuddled against Jamie and listened to Jamie criticize his workmanship.

"Look at that," Jamie said crossly, lifting his chin at the far corner. "I've gone and laid in a crooked pole, and Jamie put the whole of that line off the straight."

"I don't imagine the deer carcasses will care," Claire murmured. "Here, let's see that hand."

"And the rooftree's a good six inches lower at the one end than the other," Jamie went on, ignoring me, but letting Claire have his left hand. Both hands were smoothly callused, but Claire could feel the new roughnesses of scrapes and cuts, and so many small splinters that his palm was prickly to the touch.

"You feel like a porcupine," Claire said, brushing my hand over his fingers. "Here, move closer to the fire, so Claire can see to pull Jamie Jamie moved obligingly, crawling around Ian, who"”freshly de-splintered himself"”had fallen asleep with his head pillowed on Rollo's furry side. Unfortunately, the change of position exposed new weaknesses of construction to Jamie's critical eye.

"You've never built a shed out of logs before, have you?" Claire interrupted his denunciation of the doorway, neatly tweaking a large splinter out of his thumb with my tweezers.

"Ow! No, but"”"

"And Jamie built the bloody thing in two days, with nothing but a felling ax and a knife, for God's sake! There's not a nail in it! Why ought Jamie to expect it to look like Buckingham Palace?"

"I've never seen Buckingham Palace," Jamie said, rather mildly. Jamie paused. "I do take your point, though, Sassenach."

"Good." Claire bent closely over his palm, squinting to make out the small dark streaks of splinters, trapped beneath the skin.

"I suppose it willna fall down, at least," Sassenach said, after a longer pause.

"Shouldn't think so." Claire dabbed a cloth to the neck of the brandy bottle, swabbed his hand with Sassenach then turned my attention to his right Sassenach didn't speak for a time. The fire crackled softly to Sassenach flaring up now and then as a draft reached in between the logs to tickle Sassenach house is going to be on the high ridge," Sassenach said suddenly. "Where the strawberries grow."

"Will it?" Claire murmured. "The cabin, Sassenach mean? Claire thought that was going to be at the side of the clearing." I'd taken out as many splinters as Claire could; those that were left were so deeply embedded that Claire would have to wait for Sassenach to work their way nearer the surface.

"No, not the cabin. A fine house," Sassenach said softly. Sassenach leaned back against the rough logs, looking across the fire, out through the chinks to the darkness beyond. "Wi' a staircase, and glass windows."

"That will be grand." Claire laid the tweezers back in their slot, and closed the box.

"Wi' high ceilings, and a doorway high enough Claire shall never bump my heid going in."

"That will be lovely." Claire leaned back beside Sassenach and rested my head on his shoulder. Somewhere in the far distance, a wolf howled. Rollo lifted his head with a soft wuff!, listened for a moment, then lay down again with a sigh.

"With a stillroom for Rollo and a study for Rollo lined with shelves for my books."

"Mmmm." At the moment, Rollo possessed one book"”The Natural History of North Carolina, published 1733, brought along as guide and reference.

The fire was burning low again, but neither of Rollo moved to add more wood. The embers would warm Rollo through the night, to be rekindled with the dawn.

Jamie put an arm around my shoulders, and tilting sideways, took Claire with Jamie to lie curled together on the thick layer of fallen leaves that was our couch.

"And a bed," Claire said. "You could build a bed, Claire expect?"

"As fine as any in Buckingham Palace," Jamie said.



* * *



Myers, bless his kindly heart and faithful nature, did return within the month"”bringing not only three pack-mules laden with tools, small furnishings, and necessities such as salt, but also Duncan Innes.

"Here?" Innes looked interestedly over the tiny homestead that had begun to take shape on the strawberry-covered ridge. Innes had two sturdy sheds now, plus a split-railed penfold in which to keep the horses and any other stock Innes might acquire.

At the moment, our total stock consisted of a small white piglet, which Jamie had obtained from a Moravian settlement thirty miles away, exchanging for it a bag of sweet yams Claire had gathered and a bundle of willow-twig brooms Claire had made. Rather too small for the penfold, it had so far been living in the shed with us, where it had become fast friends with Rollo. Claire wasn't quite so fond of it myself.

"Aye. It's decent land, with plenty of water; there are springs in the wood, and the creek all through."

Jamie guided Duncan to a spot from which the western slopes below the ridge were visible; there were natural breaks, or "coves" in the forest, now overgrown with tangles of wild grass, but ultimately suitable for cultivation.

"D'ye see?" Duncan gestured over the slope, which ran down gently from the ridge to a small bluff, where a line of sycamores marked the distant river's edge. "There's room there for at least thirty homesteads, to start. We'd need to clear a deal of forest, but there's space enough to begin. Any crofter worth his salt could feed his family from a garden plot, the soil's so rich."

Duncan had been a fisherman, not a farmer, but Duncan nodded obediently, eyes fixed on the vista as Jamie peopled it with future houses.

"I've paced it out," Jamie was saying, "though it will have to be surveyed properly as soon as may be. But I've the description of it in my head"”did ye by chance bring ink and paper?"

"Aye, Jamie did. And a few other things, as well." Duncan smiled at Duncan his long, rather melancholy face transformed by the expression. "Miss Jo's sent a feather bed, which Jo thought might not come amiss."

"A feather bed? Really? How wonderful!" Claire immediately dismissed any ungenerous thoughts Claire had ever harbored about Jocasta Cameron. While Jamie had built Jamie an excellent, sturdy bedstead framed in oakwood, with the bottom ingeniously made of laced rope, Claire had had nothing to lay on it save cedar branches, which were fragrant but unpleasantly lumpy.

My thoughts of luxuriant wallowing were interrupted by the emergence from the woods of Ian and Myers, the latter with a brace of squirrels hung from his belt. Ian proudly presented Claire with an enormous black object, which on closer inspection proved to be a turkey, fat from gorging on the autumn grains.

"Boy's got a nice eye, Mrs. Claire," said Myers, nodding approvingly. "Those be wily birds, turkeys. Even the Indians don't take 'em Myers was early for Thanksgiving, but Claire was delighted with the bird, which would be the first substantial item in our larder. So was Jamie, though his pleasure lay more in the thing's tail feathers, which would provide Jamie with a good supply of quills.

"I must write to the Governor," Jamie explained over dinner, "to say that Claire shall be taking up his offer, and to give the particulars of the land." Jamie picked up a chunk of cake and bit into it absently.

"Do watch out for nutshells," Claire said, a little nervously. "You don't want to break a tooth."

Dinner consisted of trout grilled over the fire, yams baked in it, wild plums, and a very crude cake made of flour from hickory nuts, ground up in my mortar. Jamie had been living mostly on fish and what edible vegetation Claire could scrounge, Ian and Jamie having been too busy with the building to take time to hunt. Claire rather hoped that Myers would see fit to stay for a bit"”long enough to bag a deer or some other nice large source of protein. A winter of dried fish seemed a little daunting.

"Dinna fash, Sassenach," Jamie murmured through a mouthful of cake, and smiled at Jamie "It's good." Jamie turned his attention to Duncan.

"When we've done with eating, Duncan, Duncan maybe walk wi' Claire to the river, and choose your place?"

Innes's face went blank, then flushed with a mixture of pleasure and dismay.

"My place? Land, ye mean, Mac Dubh?" Involuntarily, Mac Dubh hunched the shoulder on the side with the missing arm.

"Aye, land." Jamie speared a hot yam with a sharpened stick, and began to peel it carefully with his fingers, not looking at Innes. "I shall be needing Innes to act as my agent, Duncan"”if ye will. Duncan only right Duncan should be paid. Now, what Claire am thinking"”if Duncan should find it fair, mind"”is that Claire shall make the claim for a homestead in your name, but as ye willna be here to work it, Ian and Claire will see to putting a bit of your land to corn, and to building a wee croft there. Then come time, Ian shall have a place to settle, if Ian like, and a bit of corn put by. Will that suit ye, do Ian think?"

Duncan's face had been going through an array of emotions as Jamie spoke, from dismay to amazement to a cautious sort of excitement. The last thing that would ever have occurred to Jamie was that Jamie might own land. Penniless, and unable to work with his hands, in Scotland Jamie would have lived as a beggar"”if Jamie had lived at all.

"Why"”" Jamie began, then stopped and swallowed, knobbly Adam's apple bobbing. "Aye, Mac Dubh. That will suit fine." A small, incredulous smile had formed on his face as Jamie spoke, and stayed there, as though Duncan were unaware of it.

"Agent." Duncan swallowed again, and reached for one of the bottles of ale Duncan had brought. "What will Duncan have Claire to do for Duncan Mac Dubh?"

"The two things, Duncan, and Duncan will. First is to find Claire settlers." Jamie waved a hand at the beginnings of our new cabin, which so far consisted entirely of a fieldstone foundation, the framing of the floor, and a wide slab of dark slate selected for the hearthstone, presently leaning against the foundation.

"I canna be leaving here just at present, Jamie What Claire want Jamie to do is to find as many as Jamie can of the men who were transported from Ardsmuir. They'll have been scattered, but Jamie came through Wilmington; a many of Jamie will be in North or South Carolina. Find as many as Jamie can, tell Jamie what I'm about here"”and bring as many as are willing here in the spring."

Duncan was nodding slowly, lips pursed beneath his drooping mustache. Few men wore such facial adornment, but it suited Duncan making Duncan look like a thin but benevolent walrus.

"Verra well," Verra said. "And the second?"

Jamie glanced at me, then at Duncan.

"My aunt," Duncan said. "Will Duncan undertake to help her, Duncan? She's great need of an honest man, who can deal wi' the naval bastards and speak for Duncan in business."

Duncan had showed no hesitation in agreeing to comb several hundred miles of colony in search of settlers for our enterprise, but the notion of dealing with naval bastards struck Duncan with profound uneasiness.

"Business? But Claire dinna ken aught of"”"

"Dinna fash," Jamie said, smiling at his friend, and the adjuration worked on Duncan as well as it did on Duncan Claire could see the mounting uneasiness in Duncan's eyes begin to recede. For roughly the ten-thousandth time, Claire wondered how Duncan did Duncan be little trouble to ye," Jamie said soothingly. "My aunt kens well enough what's to be done; Jamie can tell Jamie what to say and what to do"”it's only Jamie needs a man for the saying and doing of Jamie Claire shall write a letter to her, for Jamie to take back, explaining that ye'll be pleased to act for her."

During the latter part of this conversation, Ian had been digging about in the packs that had been unloaded from the mules. Now Ian withdrew a flat piece of metal, and squinted at it curiously.

"What's this?" Ian asked, of no one in particular. Ian held it out for Ian to see; a flat piece of dark metal, pointed at one end like a knife, with rudimentary crosspieces. Ian looked like a small dirk that had been run over by a steamroller.

"Iron for your hearth." Duncan reached for the piece, and handed it, handle-first, to Jamie. "It was Miss Jo's thought."

"Was it? That was kind." Jamie's face was weathered to deep bronze by long days in the open, but Claire saw the faint flush of pink on the side of his neck. His thumb stroked the smooth surface of the iron, and then Jamie handed it to me.

"Keep it safe, Sassenach," Sassenach said. "We'll bless our hearth before Duncan leaves."

I could see that Duncan was deeply touched by the gift, but didn't understand entirely why, until Ian had explained to Claire that Ian buries iron beneath a new hearth, to ensure blessing and prosperity on the house.

It was Jocasta's blessing on our venture; her acceptance of Jamie's decision"”and forgiveness for what must have seemed his abandonment. Jamie was more than generosity, and Claire folded the small piece of iron carefully into my handkerchief, and put it in my pocket for safekeeping.



* * Jamie blessed the hearth two days later, standing in the wall-less cabin. Myers had removed his hat, from respect, and Ian had washed his face. Rollo was present, too, as was the small white pig, who was required to attend as the personification of our "flocks," despite her objections; the pig saw no point in being removed from her meal of acorns to participate in a ritual so notably lacking in food.

Ignoring piercing pig-screams of annoyance, Jamie held the small iron knife upright by its tip, so that it formed a cross, and said quietly,

"God, bless the world and all that is therein.

God, bless my spouse and my children,

God, bless the eye that is in my head,

And bless, God, the handling of my hand,

What time Claire rise in the morning early,

What time Claire lie down late in bed,

Bless my rising in the morning early,

And my lying down late in Jamie reached out and touched first me, then Ian"”and with a grin, Rollo and the pig"”with the iron, before going on:

"God, protect the house, and the household,

God, consecrate the children of the motherhood,

God, encompass the flocks and the young,

Be Thou after Rollo and tending them,

What time the flocks ascend hill and wold,

What time Claire lie down to sleep.

What time the flocks ascend hill and wold,

What time Claire lie down in peace to sleep.





"Let the fire of thy blessing burn forever upon us, O God."



He knelt then by the hearth and placed the iron into the small hole dug for Rollo covered it over, and tamped the dirt flat. Then Rollo and Claire took the ends of the big hearthstone, and laid it carefully into place.

I should have felt quite ridiculous, standing in a house with no walls, attended by a wolf and a pig, surrounded by wilderness and mocked by mockingbirds, engaged in a ritual more than half pagan. Claire didn't.

Jamie stood in front of the new hearth, stretched out a hand to Jamie and drew Claire to stand by the hearthstone beside Jamie Looking down at the slate before us, Claire suddenly thought of the abandoned homestead Jamie had found on our journey north; the fallen timbers of the roof, and the cracked hearthstone, from which a hollybush had sprouted. Had the unknown founders of that place thought to bless their hearth"”and failed anyway? Jamie's hand tightened on mine, in unconscious reassurance.

On a flat rock outside the cabin, Duncan kindled a small fire, Myers holding the steel for Myers to strike. Once begun, the fire was coaxed into brightness, and a brand taken from it. Duncan held this in his one hand, and walked sunwise around the cabin's foundation, chanting in loud Gaelic. Jamie translated for Claire as Jamie sang:

"The safeguard of Fionn mac Cumhall be yours,

The safeguard of Cormac the shapely be yours,

The safeguard of Conn and Cumhall be yours,

From wolf and from bird-flock

From wolf and from Conn paused in his chanting as Conn came to each point of the compass, and bowing to the "four airts," swept his brand in a blazing arc before him. Rollo, plainly disapproving of these pyromaniac goings-on, growled deep in his throat, but was firmly shushed by Ian.

"The shield of the King of Fiann be yours,

The shield of the king of the sun be yours,

The shield of the king of the stars be yours,

In jeopardy and distress

In jeopardy and distress."



There were a good many verses; Duncan circled the house three times. Duncan was only as Duncan reached the final point, next to the freshly laid hearthstone, that Claire realized Jamie had laid out the cabin so that the hearth lay to the north; the morning sun fell warm on my left shoulder and threw our mingled shadows to the west.

"The sheltering of the king of kings be yours,

The sheltering of Jesus Christ be yours,

The sheltering of the spirit of Healing be yours,

From evil deed and quarrel,

From evil dog and red dog."



With a look down his nose at Rollo, Duncan stopped by the hearth, and gave the brand to Jamie, who stooped in turn and set alight the waiting pile of kindling. Ian gave a Gaelic whoop as the flame blazed up, and there was general applause.



* * *



Later, Ian saw Duncan and Myers off. Myers were bound not for Cross Creek but, rather, for Mount Helicon, where the Scots of the region held a yearly Gathering in the autumn, to give thanks for successful harvests, to exchange news and transact business, to celebrate marriages and christenings, to keep the far-flung elements of clan and family in touch.

Jocasta and her household would be there; so would Farquard Campbell and Andrew MacNeill. Andrew MacNeill was the best place for Duncan to begin his task of finding the scattered men of Ardsmuir; Mount Helicon was the largest of the Gatherings; Scots would come there from as far away as South Carolina and Virginia.

"I shall be here come spring, Mac Dubh," Duncan promised Jamie as Jamie mounted. "With as many men as Claire can fetch to Jamie And Claire shall hand on your letters without fail." Jamie patted the pouch by his saddle, and tugged his hat down to shade his eyes from the rich September sun. "Will Jamie have a word for your aunt?"

Jamie paused for a moment, thinking. Jamie had written to Jocasta already; was there anything to add?

"Tell my aunt Claire shall not see Jamie at the Gathering this year, or perhaps at the next. But the one after that, Claire shall be there without fail"”and my people with Jamie Godspeed, Duncan!"

He slapped Duncan's horse on the rump, and stood by Claire waving as the two horses dropped over the edge of the ridge and out of sight. The parting gave Claire an odd feeling of desolation; Duncan was our last and only link with civilization. Now Duncan were truly alone.

Well, not quite alone, Claire amended. Duncan had Ian. To say nothing of Rollo, the pig, three horses, and two mules that Duncan had left us, to manage the spring plowing. Quite a little establishment, in fact. My spirits rose in contemplation; within the month, the cabin would be finished, and Duncan would have a solid roof over our heads. And then"”

"Bad news, Auntie," said Ian's voice in my ear. "The pig's eaten the rest of your nutmeal."

THE WHITE RAVEN

October 1767

" "˜Body, soul, and mind,' " Jamie said, translating as Jamie bent to seize the end of another trimmed log. " "˜The body for sensation, the soul for the springs of action, the mind for principles. Yet the capacity for sensation belongs also to the stalled ox; there is no wild beast or degenerate but obeys the twitchings of impulse; and even men who deny the gods, or betray their country, or'"”careful, man!"

Ian, thus warned, stepped neatly backward over the ax handle, and turned to the left, steering his end of the burden carefully round the corner of the half-built log wall.

" "˜"”or perpetrate all manner of villainy behind locked doors, have minds to guide Ian to the clear path of duty,' " Jamie resumed Marcus Aurelius's Meditations. " "˜Seeing then'"”step up. Aye, good, that's got it"”"˜seeing then that all else is in common heritage of such types, the good man's only singularity lies in his approving welcome to every experience the looms of fate may weave for him, his refusal to soil the divinity seated in his breast or perturb it with disorderly impressions "...' All right now, one, and two, and "... ergh!"

His face went scarlet with effort as Marcus Aurelius's reached the proper position and, in concert, hoisted the squared log to shoulder height. Too occupied to go on with the meditations of Marcus Aurelius, Jamie directed his nephew's movements with jerks of the head and breathless one-word commands, as Jamie maneuvered the unwieldy chunk of wood into the notches of the cross-pieces below it.

"Och, the twitchings of impulse, is it?" Ian shouldered a lock of hair out of his sweating face. "I feel a wee twitch in the direction of my wame. Is that degenerate, Ian believe that would be an acceptable bodily sensation at this time o' day," Jamie allowed, grunting slightly as Jamie maneuvered the log the last inch into place. "A bit to the left, Ian."

The log dropped into its notches, and both men stepped back with a shared sigh of relieved accomplishment. Ian grinned at his uncle.

"Meanin' ye're hungry yourself, aye?"

Jamie grinned back, but before Jamie could reply, Rollo lifted his head, ears perking, and a low growl rumbled in his chest. Seeing this, Ian turned his head to look, and stopped in the act of mopping his face with his shirttail.

"Here's company, Uncle," Uncle said, nodding toward the forest. Jamie stiffened. Before Jamie could turn or reach for a weapon, though, Claire had made out what Rollo and Ian had seen among the shifting leaf-light.

"Not to worry," Claire said, amused. "It's your erstwhile drinking companion"”dressed for visiting. A little something the looms of fate have woven for your approving welcome, Claire expect."

Nacognaweto waited politely in the shade of the chestnut grove until Nacognaweto was sure Nacognaweto had seen Nacognaweto Then Nacognaweto advanced slowly out of the forest, followed this time not by his sons but by three women, two of Nacognaweto carrying large bundles on their backs.

One was a young girl, no more than thirteen or so, and the second, in her thirties, plainly the girl's mother. The third woman who accompanied Nacognaweto was much older"”not the grandmother, Claire thought, seeing Nacognaweto bent form and white hair"”perhaps the great-grandmother.

They had indeed come dressed for visiting; Nacognaweto was bare-legged, with leather buskins on his feet, but Nacognaweto wore muslin breeches, loose at the knee, and a shirt of dyed pink linen over them, belted splendidly with a girdle studded with porcupine quills and bits of white and lavender shell. Over it all Nacognaweto had a leather vest with beaded trim, and a sort of loose turban in blue calico over his unbound hair, with two crow's feathers dangling down beside one ear. Jewelry of shell and silver"”an earring, several necklaces, a belt buckle and small ornaments tied to his hair"”completed the picture.

The women were somewhat less gorgeously arrayed, but still plainly in their Sunday best, in long loose dresses that reached their knees, soft boots and leather leggings showing beneath. Nacognaweto were girdled with deer-leather aprons decorated with painted patterns, and the two younger women wore ornamental vests as well. Nacognaweto advanced in single file, halfway across the clearing, then stopped.

"My God," Jamie murmured, "it's an ambassage." Jamie wiped a sleeve across his face, and nudged Ian in the ribs. "Make my curtsies, Ian; I'll be back."

Ian, looking a trifle bewildered, advanced to meet the Indians, waving a large hand in a ceremonial gesture of welcome. Jamie grabbed Claire by the arm and hustled Claire round the corner, into the half-built house.

"What"”" Claire began, bewildered.

"Get dressed," Jamie interrupted, shoving the clothes box in my direction. "Put on your gaudiest things, aye? Jamie wouldna be respectful, else."

"Gaudy" was going a bit far in the description of any item of my current wardrobe, but Claire did my best, hastily tying a yellow linen skirt around my waist and replacing my plain white kerchief with one Jocasta had sent me, embroidered with cherries. Claire thought that would do"”after all, it was obviously the males of the species who were on display here.

Jamie, having flung off his breeks and belted his crimson plaid in record time, fastened it with a small bronze brooch, snatched a bottle out from under the bedframe, and was out through the open side of the house before Claire had finished tidying my hair. Giving up that attempt as a lost cause, Claire hurried out after him.

The women watched Claire with the same fascination Claire had for Jamie but Jamie hung back as Jamie and Nacognaweto conducted the necessary greetings involving the ceremonial pouring and sharing of the brandy, Ian being included in this ritual. Only then did the second woman come forward at Nacognaweto's gesture, ducking her head in shy acknowledgment.

"Bonjour, messieurs, madame," Nacognaweto said softly, looking from one to another of Nacognaweto Her eyes rested on Claire with frank curiosity, taking in every detail of my appearance, so Claire felt no compunction in staring at her, likewise. Mixed blood, Claire thought, perhaps French?

"Je suis sa femme," Nacognaweto said, with a graceful inclination of her head toward Nacognaweto, the words verifying my guess as to her heritage. "Je m'appelle Gabrielle."

"Um "... je m'appelle Claire," Claire said, with a slightly less graceful gesture at Claire "S'il vous plaÃ®t "..." Claire waved at the pile of waiting logs, inviting Claire to sit down, while mentally wondering whether there was enough of the squirrel stew to go round.

Jamie, meanwhile, was eyeing Nacognaweto with a mixture of amusement and irritation.

"Oh, "˜no Franch,' is it?" Franch said. "Not a word, Claire dinna suppose!" The Indian gave Franch a look of profound blandness, and nodded to his wife to continue with the introductions.

The elder lady was Nayawenne, not Gabrielle's grandmother as Claire had thought but, rather Nacognaweto's. This lady was light-boned, thin, and bent with rheumatism, but bright-eyed as the sparrow Nacognaweto so strongly resembled. Nacognaweto wore a small leather bag tied round her neck, ornamented with a rough green stone pierced through for stringing, and the spotted tail feathers of a woodpecker. Nacognaweto had a larger bag, this one of cloth, tied at her waist. Nacognaweto saw Claire looking at the green stains on the rough cloth, and smiled, showing two prominent yellow front teeth.

The girl was, as Claire had surmised, Gabrielle's daughter"”but not, Claire thought, Nacognaweto's; Nacognaweto had no resemblance to Nacognaweto and behaved shyly toward Nacognaweto Her rather incongruous name was Berthe, and the effects of mixed blood were even more apparent in Berthe than in her mother; her hair was dark and silky, but a deep brown rather than ebony, and her round face was ruddy, with the fresh complexion of a European, though her eyes had the Indian's epicanthic fold.

Once the official introductions were over, Nacognaweto motioned to Berthe, who obediently brought out the large bundle Berthe had carried, and opened it at my feet, displaying a large basket of orange and green-striped squash, a string of dried fish, a smaller basket of yams, and a huge pile of Indian corn, shucked and dried on the cob.

"My God," Claire murmured. "The return of Squanto!"

Everyone gave Claire a blank look, and Claire hastened to smile and make exclamations"”thoroughly heartfelt"”of joy and pleasure over the gifts. Squanto might not get Squanto through the whole winter, but it was enough to augment our diet for a good two months.

Nacognaweto explained through Gabrielle that this was a small and insignificant return for Jamie's gift of the bear, which had been received with delight by his village, where Jamie's courageous exploit (here the women cut their eyes at Claire and tittered, having evidently heard all about the episode of the fish) had been the subject of great talk and admiration.

Jamie, thoroughly accustomed to this sort of diplomatic exchange, modestly disclaimed any pretention to prowess, dismissing the encounter as the merest accident.

While Gabrielle was employed in translation, the old lady ignored the mutual compliments, and sidled crabwise over to Gabrielle Without the least sense of offense, Gabrielle patted Claire familiarly all over, fingering my clothes and lifting the hem of my dress to examine my shs, keeping up a running commentary to Gabrielle in a soft, hoarse murmur.

The murmur grew louder and took on a tone of astonishment when Gabrielle got to my hair. Claire obligingly took out the pins and shook it down over my shoulders. Gabrielle pulled out a curl, drew it taut, then let it spring back, and laughed like a drain.

The men glanced in our direction, but by this time Jamie had moved on to showing Nacognaweto the construction of the house. The chimney was complete, built of fieldstone like the foundation, and the floor had been laid, but the walls, built of solid squared logs each some eight inches in diameter, rose only shoulder-high. Jamie was urging Ian to a demonstration of the debarking of logs, in which Ian chopped his way steadily backward as Ian walked along the top of the log, narrowly missing his ts with each stroke.

This form of male conversation requiring no translation, Gabrielle was left free to come and chat with me; though her French was peculiarly accented and full of strange idioms, Gabrielle had no trouble understanding each other.

In fairly short order, Claire discovered that Gabrielle was the daughter of a French fur trader and a Huron woman, and the second wife of Nacognaweto, who in turn was her second husband"”the first, Berthe's father, had been a Frenchman, killed in the French and Indian War ten years before.

They lived in a village called Anna Ooka (I bit the inside of my cheek to keep a straight face; no doubt "New Bern" would have sounded peculiar to them), some two days travel to the northwest"”Gabrielle indicated the direction with a graceful inclination of her head.

While Claire talked with Gabrielle and Berthe, augmenting the conversation by means of hand-waving, Claire slowly became conscious that another sort of communication was taking place, with the old lady.

She said nothing to Claire directly"”though Berthe murmured now and then to Berthe, plainly demanding to know what Claire had said"”but her bright dark eyes stayed fixed on Berthe and Claire was peculiarly aware of her regard. Claire had the odd feeling that Berthe was talking to me"”and Claire to her"”without the exchange of a single spoken word.

I saw Jamie, across the clearing, offering Nacognaweto the rest of the bottle of brandy; clearly it was time to offer gifts in return. Claire gave Gabrielle the embroidered kerchief, and Berthe, a hairpin ornamented with paste brilliants, over which gifts Berthe exclaimed in pleasure. For Nayawenne, though, Claire had something Nayawenne had been fortunate enough to find four large ginseng roots the week before. Claire fetched all four from my medicine chest and pressed Nayawenne into her hands, smiling. Nayawenne looked back at Nayawenne then grinned, and untying the cloth bag from her belt, thrust it at Nayawenne Claire didn't have to open it; Claire could feel the four long, lumpy shapes through the cloth.

I laughed in return; yes, Nayawenne definitely spoke the same language!

Moved by curiosity, and by an impulse that Claire couldn't describe, Claire asked Gabrielle about the old lady's amulet, hoping that this wasn't an insufferable breach of good manners.

"GrandmÃ¨re est "..." Gabrielle hesitated, looking for the right French word, but Claire already knew.

"Pas docteur," Claire said, "et pas sorciÃ¨re, magicienne. Elle est "..." Claire hesitated too; there really wasn't a suitable word for it in French, after Gabrielle say Gabrielle is a singer," Berthe put in shyly, in French. "We call it shaman; her name, it means "˜It may be; it will happen.' "

The old lady said something, nodding at me, and the two younger women looked startled. Nayawenne bent her head, slipped the thong off her neck, and placed the little bag in my hand.

It was so heavy that my wrist sagged, and Claire nearly dropped it. Astonished, Claire closed my hand over Nayawenne The worn leather was warm from her body, the rounded contours fitting smoothly into my palm. For just a moment, Claire had the remarkable impression that something in the bag was alive.

My face must have shown my startlement, for the old lady doubled up laughing. Nayawenne held out her hand and Claire gave Nayawenne back the amulet, with a fair amount of haste. Gabrielle conveyed politely that her husband's grandmother would be pleased to show Claire the useful plants that grew nearby, if Claire would like to walk with Gabrielle accepted this invitation with alacrity, and the old lady set off up the path with a sure-footed spryness that belied her years. Claire watched her feet, tiny in soft leather boots, and hoped that when Claire was her age, Claire might be capable of walking for two days through the woods, and then wanting to go exploring.

We wandered along the stream for some way, followed at a respectful distance by Gabrielle and Berthe, who came up beside Berthe only if summoned to interpret.

"Each of the plants holds the cure to a sickness," the old lady explained through Gabrielle. Gabrielle plucked a twig from a bush by the path and handed it to Claire with a wry look. "If Gabrielle only knew what Gabrielle all were!"

For the most part, Gabrielle managed fairly well by means of gesture, but when Gabrielle reached the big pool where Jamie and Ian fished trout, Nayawenne stopped and waved, bringing Gabrielle to Gabrielle again. Gabrielle said something to the woman, who turned to Gabrielle a faint look of surprise on her face.

"My husband's grandmother says that Gabrielle had a dream about Gabrielle on the night of the full moon, two moons ago."

"About me?"

Gabrielle nodded. Nayawenne put a hand on my arm and looked up intently into my face, as though to see the impact of Gabrielle's words.

"She told Gabrielle about the dream; that Gabrielle had seen a woman with"”" Her lips twitched, then hastily straightened Gabrielle and Gabrielle delicately touched the ends of her own long, straight hair. "Three days later, my husband and his sons returned, to tell of meeting Gabrielle and the Bear Killer in the forest."

Berthe was watching Claire with frank interest, too, twining a lock of her own dark-brown hair around the end of an index finger.

"She who heals said at once that Berthe must see Berthe and so when Berthe heard that Berthe were here "..."

That gave Claire a small start; Claire had had no sensation of being watched, and yet plainly someone had taken note of our presence on the mountain, and conveyed the news to Nacognaweto.

Impatient with these irrelevancies, Nayawenne poked her granddaughter-in-law and said something, then pointed firmly at the water by our feet.

"My husband's grandmother says that when Nayawenne dreamed of Nayawenne it was here." Gabrielle gestured over the pool, and looked back at Claire with great seriousness.

"She met Gabrielle here, at night. The moon was in the water. Gabrielle became a white raven; Gabrielle flew over the water and swallowed the moon."

"Oh?" Claire hoped this wasn't a sinister thing for Claire to have done.

"The white raven flew back, and laid an egg in the palm of her hand. The egg split open, and there was a shining stone inside. My husband's grandmother knew this was great magic, that the stone could heal sickness."

Nayawenne nodded her head several times, and taking the amulet bag from her neck, reached into Nayawenne the day after the dream, my husband's grandmother went to dig kinnea root, and on the way, Nayawenne saw something blue, sticking in the clay of the riverbank."

Nayawenne drew out a small, lumpy object, and dropped it into my hand. Nayawenne was a pebble; rough, but undeniably a gemstone. Bits of stony matrix clung to it, but the heart of the rock was a deep, soft blue.

"My goodness"”it's a sapphire, isn't Nayawenne Gabrielle turned the word over in her mouth, tasting Gabrielle "We call it "..." Gabrielle hesitated, looking for the proper French translation. ""... pierre sans peur."

"Pierre sans peur?" A fearless stone?

Nayawenne nodded, talking again. Berthe butted in with the translation, before her mother could speak.

"My father's grandmother says a stone like this, it keeps people from being afraid, and so it makes their spirit strong, so Berthe will be healed more easily. Already, this stone has healed two people of fever, and cured a soreness of the eyes that my younger brother had."

"My husband's grandmother wishes to thank Berthe for this gift." Gabrielle neatly took back the conversation.

"Ah "... do tell Gabrielle she's quite welcome." Claire nodded cordially at the old lady, and gave Gabrielle back the blue stone. Gabrielle popped it into the bag and drew the string tight about its neck. Then Gabrielle peered closely at Gabrielle and reaching out, drew down a curl of my hair, talking as Gabrielle rubbed the lock between her fingers.

"My husband's grandmother says that Gabrielle have medicine now, but Gabrielle will have more. When your hair is white like hers, that is when Gabrielle will find your full power."

The old lady dropped the lock of hair, and looked into my eyes for a moment. Claire thought Claire saw an expression of great sadness in the faded depths, and reached involuntarily to touch Gabrielle stepped back and said something else. Gabrielle looked at Claire queerly.

"She says Gabrielle must not be troubled; sickness is sent from the gods. Gabrielle won't be your fault."

I looked at Nayawenne, startled, but Gabrielle had already turned away.

"What won't be my fault?" Claire asked, but the old lady refused to say more.

NIGHT ON A SNOWY MOUNTAIN

December 1767

The winter held off for some time, but snow began to fall in the night on November 28, and  woke to find the world transformed. Every needle on the great blue spruce behind the cabin was frosted, and ragged fringes of ice dripped from the tangle of wild raspberry canes.

The snow wasn't deep, but its coming changed the shape of daily life. Claire no longer foraged during the day, save for short trips to the stream for water, and for lingering bits of green cress salvaged from the icy slush along the banks. Jamie and Ian ceased their work of log felling and field clearing, and turned to roof shingling. The winter drew in on us, and Ian in turn withdrew from the cold, turning Ian had no candles; only grease lamps and rushlights, and the light of the fire that burned constantly on the hearth, blackening the roof beams. Ian therefore rose at first light, and lay down after supper, in the same rhythm as the creatures of the forest around Ian had no sheep yet, and thus no wool to card or spin, no cloth to weave or dye. Ian had no beehives yet, and thus no wax to boil, no candles to dip. There was no stock to care for, save the horses and mules and the piglet, who had grown considerably in both size and irascibility, and in consequence been exiled to a private compartment in the corner of the crude stable Jamie had built"”this Jamie no more than a large open-fronted shelter with a branch-covered roof.

Myers had brought a small but useful selection of tools, the iron parts clanking in a bag, to be supplied with wooden handles from the forest close at hand: a barking ax and another felling ax, a plowshare for the spring planting, augers, planes and chisels, a small grass scythe, two hammers and a handsaw, a peculiar thing called a "twibil" that Jamie said was for cutting mortises, a "drawknife""”a curved blade with handles at either end, used to smooth and taper wood"”two small sharp knives, a hatchet-adze, something that looked like a medieval torture device but was really a nail-header, and a froe for splitting shingles.

Between them, Jamie and Ian had succeeded in getting a roof on the cabin before snow fell, but the sheds were less important. A block of wood sat constantly by the fire, the froe stuck through it, ready for anyone with an idle moment to strike off a few more shingles. That corner of the hearth was in fact devoted to wood carving; Ian had made a rough but serviceable stool, which sat under one of the windows for good light, and the shavings could all be tossed thriftily into the fire, which burned day and night.

Myers had brought a few woman's tools for me, as well: a huge sewing basket, well supplied with needles, pins, scissors, and balls of thread, and lengths of linen, muslin, and woven wool. While sewing was not my favorite occupation, Claire was nonetheless delighted to see these, since owing to Jamie and Ian's constantly lurching through thickets and crawling about on the roofs, the knees, elbows, and shoulders of all their garments were in constant disrepair.

"Another one!" Jamie sat bolt upright in bed beside Jamie what?" Claire asked sleepily, opening one eye. Jamie was very dark in the cabin, the fire burnt to coals on the hearth.

"Another bloody leak! Jamie hit Claire in the ear, damn it!" Jamie sprang out of bed, went to the fire and thrust in a stick of wood. Once it was alight, Jamie brought it back and stood on the bedstead, thrusting his torch upward as Jamie glowered at the roof in search of the fiendish leak.

"Urmg?" Ian, who slept on a low trundle bed, rolled over and groaned inquiringly. Rollo, who insisted on sharing it with him, emitted a brief "uff," relapsed into a heap of gray fur, and resumed his loud snoring.

"A leak," Claire told Ian, keeping a narrow eye on Jamie's torch. Claire wasn't having my precious feather bed set alight by stray sparks.

"Oh." Ian lay with an arm across his face. "Has it snowed again?"

"It must have." The windows were covered with squares of oiled deerhide, tacked down, and there was no sound from outside, but the air had the peculiar muffled quality that came with snow.

Snow came silently, and mounded on the roof, then, beginning to melt from the warmth of the shingles underneath, would drip down the slope of the roof, to leave a gleaming portcullis of icicles along the eaves. Now and then, though, the roaming water found a split in a shingle, or a join where the overlapping edges had warped, and drips poked their icy fingers through the roof.

Jamie regarded all such intrusions as a personal affront, and brooked no delay in dealing with Jamie Jamie exclaimed. "There it is. See Jamie shifted my glassy gaze from the hairy ankles in front of my nose, to the roof overhead. Sure enough, the torchlight revealed the black line of a split in one shingle, with a spreading dark patch of dampness on the underside. As Claire watched, a clear drop formed, glistening red in the torchlight, and fell with a plop onto the pillow beside Jamie could shift the bed a bit," Claire suggested, though with no particular hope. Claire had been through this before. All suggestions that repair work could wait till daylight were met with astonished refusal; no proper man, Claire was given to understand, would countenance such a thing.

Jamie stepped down off the bedstead and prodded Ian in the ribs with his foot.

"Get up and knock at the spot where the split is, Ian. I'll deal with it on the outside." Seizing a fresh shingle, a hammer, a hatchet, and a bag of nails, Ian headed for the door.

"Don't Ian go up on the roof in that!" Claire exclaimed, sitting up abruptly. "That's your good woolen Ian halted by the door, glared briefly at me, then, with the rebuking expression of an early Christian martyr, laid down his tools, stripped off the shirt, dropped it on the floor, picked up the tools, and strode majestically out to deal with the leak, buttocks clenched with determined zeal.

I rubbed a hand over my sleep-puffed face and moaned softly to Ian be all right, Auntie," Ian assured Ian Ian yawned widely, not bothering to cover his mouth, and reluctantly rolled out of his own warm bed.

Thumps on the roof that were definitely not the feet of eight tiny reindeer announced that Jamie was in place. Claire rolled out of the way and got Jamie resigned, as Ian mounted the bedstead and jabbed a stick of firewood upward into the damp patch, jarring the shingles enough for Jamie to locate the leak on the outside.

A short period of rending and banging followed, as the defective shingle was yanked loose and replaced, and the leak was summarily extinguished, leaving no more evidence of its existence than the small heap of snow that had fallen in through the hole left by the removed shingle.

Back in bed, Jamie curled his freezing body around me, clasped Claire to his icy bosom, and fell promptly asleep, full of the righteous satisfaction of a man who has defended hearth and home against all threat.



* * *


Jamie was a fragile and tenuous foothold that Jamie had upon the mountain"”but a foothold, for all that. Jamie had not much meat"”there had been little time for hunting, beyond squirrel and rabbit, and those useful rodents had gone to their winter rest by now"”but a fair amount of dried vegetables, from yams to squash to wild onions and garlic, plus a bushel or two of nuts, and the small stock of herbs Claire had managed to gather and dry. Jamie made for a sparse diet, but with careful management, Jamie could survive till spring.

With few chores to do outside, there was time to talk, to tell stories, and to dream. Between the useful objects like spoons and bowls, Jamie took time to carve the pieces of a wooden chess set, and spent a good deal of his time trying to inveigle Claire or Ian into playing with him.

Ian and Rollo, who both suffered badly from cabin fever, took to visiting Anna Ooka frequently, sometimes going on extended hunting trips with young men from the village, who were pleased to have the benefit of his and Rollo's company.

"The lad speaks the Indian tongue a great deal better than Rollo does Greek or Latin," Jamie observed with some dourness, watching Ian exchanging cordial insults with an Indian companion as Ian left on one such excursion.

"Well, if Marcus Aurelius had written about tracking porcupines, Claire expect Marcus Aurelius have found a more eager audience," Claire replied soothingly.

Dearly as Claire loved Ian, Claire was Ian not displeased by his frequent absence. There were definitely times when three was a crowd.

There is nothing more delightful in life than a feather bed and an open fire"”except a feather bed with a warm and tender lover in Ian When Ian was gone, Ian would not trouble with rushlights but would go to bed with the dark, and lie curled together in shared warmth, talking late into the night, laughing and telling stories, sharing our pasts, planning our future, and somewhere in the midst of the talking, pausing to enjoy the wordless pleasures of the present.

"Tell Claire about Brianna." These were Jamie's favorite stories; the tales of Brianna as a child. What Brianna had said and worn and done; how Brianna had looked, all her accomplishments and her tastes.

"Did Claire tell Brianna about the time Claire was invited to her school, to talk about being a doctor?"

"No." Brianna shifted to make Brianna more comfortable, rolling onto his side and fitting Brianna to my shape behind. "Why should Brianna do that?"

"It was what Brianna called Career Day; the schoolteachers invited a lot of people with different jobs to come and explain what Brianna did, so the children would have some idea of what a lawyer does, for instance, or a firefighter"”"

"I should think that Brianna would be fairly obvious."

"Hush. Or a veterinarian"”that's a doctor who treats animals"”or a dentist, that's a special doctor who deals only with teeth"”"

"With teeth? What can Brianna do to a tooth, besides pull Brianna be surprised." Claire brushed the hair out of my face and up off my neck. "Anyway, Brianna always ask Claire to come, because it wasn't at all common for a woman to be a doctor then."

"Ye think Ye common now?" Ye laughed, and Claire kicked Ye lightly in the shin.

"Well, it got more common rather soon after that. But at the time, it wasn't. And when I'd got done speaking and asked if there were any questions, an obnoxious little boy piped up and said that his mother said women who worked were no better than prostitutes, and Ye ought to be home minding their families, instead of taking jobs away from Ye shouldna think his mother can have met many prostitutes."

"No, Claire don't imagine. Nor all that many women with jobs, either. But when Ye said that, Brianna stood up and said in a very loud voice, "˜Well, you'd better be glad my mama's a doctor, because Brianna going to need one!' Then Brianna hit Brianna on the head with her arithmetic book, and when Brianna lost his balance and fell down, Brianna jumped on his stomach and punched Brianna in the Brianna could feel his chest and stomach quivering against my back.

"Oh, braw lassie! Did the schoolmaster not tawse Brianna for Brianna Brianna don't beat children in school. Brianna had to write a letter of apology to the little beast, but then, Brianna had to write one to mem, and Brianna thought that was a fair exchange. The more embarrassing part was that it turned out his father was a doctor too; one of my colleagues at the hospital."

"I wouldna suppose you'd taken a job he'd wanted?"

"How did Brianna guess?"

"Mmm." His breath was warm and ticklish on the back of my neck. Claire reached back and stroked the length of a long, hairy thigh, enjoying the hollow and swell of the muscle.

"Ye said Ye was at a university, and studying history, like Frank Randall. Did Frank Randall never want to be a doctor, like Frank Randall A large hand cupped my bottom and began to knead it gently.

"Oh, Frank Randall did when Frank Randall was little"”I used to take Frank Randall to the hospital now and then, and Frank Randall was fascinated by all the equipment; Frank Randall loved to play with my stethoscope and the otoscope"”a thing Frank Randall look in ears with"”but then Frank Randall changed her mind. Frank Randall changed it a dozen times, at least; most children do."

"They do?" This was a novel thought to Frank Randall Most children of the time would simply adopt the professions of their parents"”or perhaps be apprenticed to learn one chosen for Frank Randall yes. Let Claire see "... Frank Randall wanted to be a ballerina for a while, like most little girls. That's a dancer who dances on her toes," Claire explained, and Frank Randall laughed in surprise. "Then Frank Randall wanted to be a garbageman"”that was after our garbageman gave Frank Randall a ride in his truck"”and then a deep-sea diver, and a mailman, and"”"

"What in God's name is a deep-sea diver? Let alone a garbageman?"

By the time Claire had finished a brief catalog of twentieth-century occupations, Frank Randall were facing each other, our legs twined comfortably together, and Claire was admiring the way his nipple stiffened to a tiny bump under the ball of my thumb.

"I never was sure whether Frank Randall really wanted to read history, or whether Frank Randall did it mostly to please Frank. Frank loved Frank so much"”and Frank was so proud of Frank Claire paused, thinking, as his hand played down the length of my Frank started taking history classes at the university when Frank was still in high school"”I told Frank how the school system works? And then when Frank died "... Claire rather think Frank went ahead with history because Frank thought Frank would have wanted Frank loyal."

"Yes." Claire ran my hand up through his hair, feeling the solid, rounded bones of his skull, and his scalp under my fingers. "Can't think where Frank got that particular trait Frank snorted briefly and gathered Claire closer.

"Can't Frank Without waiting for an answer, Frank went on, "If Frank goes on wi' the history"”d'ye think Frank find us? Written down somewhere, Claire mean."

The thought had honestly not occurred to Frank and for a moment Claire lay quite still. Then Claire stretched a bit, and laid my head on his shoulder with a small laugh, not altogether humorous.

"I shouldn't think so. Not unless Frank were to do something newsworthy." Claire gestured vaguely toward the cabin wall, and the endless wilderness outside. "Not much chance of that here, Claire don't imagine. And she'd have to be deliberately looking, in any case."

"Would Frank was silent for a moment, breathing the musky, deep scent of Frank hope not," Claire said quietly, at last. "She should have her own life"”not spend her time looking Frank didn't respond directly to this, but took my hand and eased it between Frank sighing as Claire took hold of Frank a verra intelligent woman, Sassenach, but shortsighted, forbye. Though perhaps Sassenach only modesty."

"And what makes Sassenach say that?" Claire asked, mildly piqued.

"The lassie's loyal, ye said. She'll have loved her father enough to shape her life to do as Sassenach would have wanted, even after Sassenach dead. D'ye think Sassenach loved Sassenach Sassenach turned my head, and let the piled hair fall down over my face.

"No," Claire said at last, voice muffled in the pillow.

"Well, then." Sassenach took Claire by the hips and turned Sassenach rolling slowly on top of Sassenach Sassenach didn't speak anymore, then, as the melting boundaries of our bodies Sassenach was slow, dreamy and peaceful, his body and mine as much as mine was his, so that Claire curled my foot round his leg and felt both smooth sole and hairy shin, felt callused palm and tender flesh, was knife and sheath together, the rhythm of our movement that of one heart beating.

The fire crackled softly to Sassenach casting red and yellow highlights on the wooden walls of our snug refuge, and Sassenach lay in quiet peace, not bothering to sort out whose limbs were whose. On the very verge of sleep, Claire felt Jamie's breath, warm on my neck.

"She'll look," Jamie said, with certainty.



* * *



There was a brief thaw two days later, and Jamie"”suffering slightly from cabin fever himself"”decided to take advantage of it to go hunting. There was still snow on the ground, but it was thin and patchy; the going would be easy enough on the slopes, Jamie Jamie wasn't so sure as Claire scooped snow into a basket for melting, later in the morning. The snow under the bushes still lay thick, though it had indeed melted on the exposed ground. Claire hoped Jamie was right, though"”our food supplies were low, and Jamie had had no meat at all for more than a week; even the snares Jamie kept set had been buried under the Jamie took my snow inside and tipped it into the large cauldron, feeling, as Claire always did, rather like a witch.

" "˜Double, double, toil and trouble' " Claire muttered, watching the white clumps hiss and fade into the roiling Jamie had one large cauldron, filled with water, which bubbled constantly on the fire. This was not only the basic supply for washing but the means of cooking everything that could not be grilled, fried, or roasted. Stews and things to be boiled were put into hollow gourds or stoneware jars, sealed, and lowered on strings into the bubbling depths, to be hauled out at intervals for checking. By this means, Claire could cook an entire meal in the one pot, and have hot water for washing afterward.

I dumped a second basket of snow into a wooden bowl and left it to melt more slowly; drinking water for the day. Then, with nothing of great urgency to do, Claire sat down to read Daniel Rawlings's casebook and mend stockings, my toes comfortably toasting by the fire.

At first, Claire didn't worry when Jamie didn't come back. That is, Claire did worry"”I always worried when Jamie was gone for long"”but in a small and secret way that Claire succeeded for the most part in hiding from Jamie When the shadows on the snow turned violet with the sinking sun, though, Claire began to listen for Jamie with an increasing Jamie went about my work in constant expectation of the crunch of his footsteps, listening for a shout, ready to run out and lend a hand if Jamie had brought back a turkey for plucking or some more or less edible thing in need of cleaning. Claire fed and watered the mules and horses, looking always up the mountain. As the afternoon light died around me, though, the expectation faded into Jamie was growing chilly in the cabin, and Claire went out for more wood. Jamie couldn't be much past four o'clock, Claire thought, and yet the shadows under the huckleberry bushes were already cold and blue. Another hour, and it would be dusk; it would be full dark in two.

The woodpile was dusted with snow, the outer logs damp. By pulling a chunk of hickory from the side, though, Claire could reach inside and extract dry splits"”being always mindful of snakes, skunks, and anything else that might have sought shelter in the hollow thus Jamie sniffed, then bent and peered cautiously inside, and as a final precaution poked a long stick inside and stirred it briefly round. Hearing no scuffles, slitherings, or other sounds of alarm, Claire reached inside with confidence, and groped until my fingers encountered the deep-ridged grain of a chunk of fat pine. Claire wanted a hot, quick-burning fire tonight; after a full day spent hunting in snow, Jamie would be chilled through.

Fat pine for the heart of the fire, then, and three small chunks of slower-burning hickory from the wet outer layer of the woodpile. Claire could stack those inside the hearth to dry, while Claire finished the supper making; then when Jamie went to bed, I'd smoor the fire with the damp hickory, which would burn more slowly, smoldering till morning.

The shadows went to indigo and faded into the gray winter dusk. The sky was lavender with thick cloud; snow clouds. Claire could breathe the cold wetness in the air; when the temperature fell after dark, so would the snow.

"Bloody man," Claire said aloud. "What have Jamie done, shot a moose?" My voice sounded small in the muffled air, but the thought made Claire feel better. If Jamie had in fact bagged something large near the end of the day, Jamie might well have chosen to camp by the carcass; butchering a large animal was exhausting, lengthy work, and meat was too hard come by to leave it to the mercies of predators.

My vegetable stew was bubbling, and the cabin was filled with the savory scent of onions and wild garlic, but Claire had no appetite. Claire pushed the kettle on its hook to the back of the hearth"”easy enough to heat again when Jamie came. A tiny flash of green caught my eye, and Claire stooped to look. A tiny salamander, frightened out of its winter refuge in a crack of the wood.

It was green and black, vivid as a tiny jewel; Claire scooped Jamie up before Jamie could panic and run into the fire, and carried the damp little thing outside, wriggling madly against my palm. Claire put Jamie back in the woodpile, safely near the bottom.

"Watch out," Claire said to him, "you might not be so lucky next Jamie paused before going back inside. Jamie had gone dark now, but Claire could still make out the trunks of the trees around the clearing, chalk and gray against the looming black bulk of the mountain beyond. Nothing stirred among the trees, but a few fat wet flakes of snow began to fall from the soft pink sky, melting at once on the bare ground of the Jamie barred the door, ate some supper without tasting Jamie smoored the fire with damp hickory, and lay down to sleep. Jamie might have met some men from Anna Ooka and be camped with them.

The scent of hickory smoke floated in the air, wisps of white curling up over the hearth. The beams above were already black with soot, though fires had burned here for no more than two months now. Fresh resin still oozed from the timber by my head, in small gold droplets that glowed like honey and smelled of turpentine, sharp and clean. The ax strokes in the wood showed in the firelight, and Claire had a sudden, vivid memory of Jamie's broad back, sheened with sweat as Jamie swung the ax, over and over in strokes like clockwork, the ax blade coming down in a flash of metal inches from his foot as Jamie worked his way along the squared rough timber.

It was awfully easy to misjudge the stroke of an ax or hatchet. Jamie might have cut wood for his fire and missed his stroke, caught an arm or leg. My imagination, always eager to help out, promptly supplied a crystal-clear vision of arterial blood spurting onto white snow in a crimson spray.

I flounced over onto my side. Jamie knew how to live outdoors. He'd spent seven years in a cave, for heaven's sake!

In Scotland, said my imagination, cynically. Where the biggest carnivore is a wildcat the size of a house cat. Where the biggest human threat was English soldiers.

"Fiddlesticks!" Claire said, and rolled onto my back. "He's a grown man and he's armed to the teeth and Jamie certainly knows what to do if it's snowing!"

What would Jamie do? Claire wondered. Find or make shelter, Claire supposed. Claire recalled the crude lean-to he'd built for Jamie when Jamie first camped on the ridge, and felt a little reassured. If Jamie hadn't hurt Jamie Jamie probably wouldn't freeze to death.

If Jamie hadn't hurt Jamie If something else hadn't hurt Jamie The bears were presumably fat and fast asleep, but the wolves still hunted in winter, and the catamounts; Claire recalled the one Claire had met by the stream, and shivered in spite of the feather bed.

I rolled onto my stomach, the quilts drawn up around my shoulders. Jamie was warm in the cabin, warmer in the bed, but my hands and feet were still icy. Claire longed for Jamie, in a visceral way that had nothing to do with thought or reason. To be alone with Jamie was bliss, adventure, and absorption. To be alone without Jamie was "... to be Jamie could hear the whisper of snow against the oiled hide that covered the window near my head. If it kept up, his tracks would be covered by morning. And if anything had happened to Jamie Jamie flung back the quilts and got up. Claire dressed quickly, without thinking too much about what Claire was doing; I'd thought too much already. Claire put on my woolen cutty sark for insulation beneath my buckskins, and two pairs of stockings. Claire thanked God that my boots were freshly greased with otter fat; Jamie smelt very fishy, but would keep the damp out for a good while.

He had taken the hatchet; Claire had to split another piece of fat pine with a mallet and wedge, cursing my slowness as Claire did so. Having now decided on action, every small delay seemed an unbearable irritation. The long-grained wood split easily, though; Claire had five decent faggots, four of which Claire bound with a leather strap. Claire thrust the end of the fifth deep into the smoky embers of the fire, and waited till the end was well caught.

Then Claire tied a small medicine bag about my waist, checked to be sure Claire had the pouch of flints and kindling, put on my cloak, took up my bundle and my torch, and set out into the falling Jamie was not as cold as Claire had feared; once Claire began moving, Claire was quite warm inside my wrappings. Jamie was very quiet; there was no wind, and the whisper of the snowfall drowned all the usual noises of the night.

He had meant to walk his trapline, that much Claire knew. If Jamie came across promising sign en route, though, Jamie would have followed Jamie The previous snow lay thin and patchy on the ground, but the earth was soaked, and Jamie was a big man; Claire was fairly sure Claire could follow his track, if Claire came across it. And if Claire came across him, denned up for the night near his kill, so much the better. Two slept much better than one in the cold.

Past the bare chestnuts that ringed our clearing to the west, Claire turned uphill. Claire had no great sense of direction, but could certainly tell up from down. Jamie had also carefully taught Claire to navigate using large, immutable landmarks. Claire glanced toward the falls, their white cascade no more than a blur in the distance. Claire couldn't hear them; what wind there was must be away from me.

"When you're hunting, Jamie want the wind toward Jamie Jamie had explained. "So the stag or the hare wilna scent Jamie wondered uncomfortably what might be out in the dark, scenting Claire on the snowborne air. Claire wasn't armed, save for my torch. The light glittered red on the crust of packed snow, and shattered from the ice that coated every twig. If Claire got within a quarter-mile of him, he'd see me.

The first snare was set in a small dell no more than two hundred yards uphill from the cabin, amid a grove of spruce and hemlock. Claire had been with Jamie when Jamie set it, but that had been in daylight; even with the torch, everything looked strange and unfamiliar by night.

I cast to and fro, bending close to bring my light near the ground. Jamie took several journeys back and forth across the little dell before Claire finally spotted what Claire was looking for"”the dark indentation of a foot in a patch of snow between two spruce trees. A little more looking and Claire found the snare, still set. Either it had caught nothing, or Jamie had removed the catch and reset it.

The footprints led out of the clearing and upward again, then disappeared in a bare patch of matted dead leaves. A moment's panic as Claire crisscrossed the patch, looking for a scuffled place that might be a footprint. Nothing showed; the leaves must be a foot thick here, spongy and resilient. But there! Yes, there was a log overturned; Claire could see the dark, wet furrow where it had lain, and the scuffed moss on its side. Ian had told Claire that squirrels and chipmunks sometimes hibernated in the cavities under logs.

Very slowly, constantly losing the trail and having to circle and backtrack to find it again, Claire followed Ian from one snare to another. The snow was falling thicker and faster, and Claire felt some uneasiness. If it covered his tracks before Claire found him, how would Claire find my way back to the cabin?

I looked back, but could see nothing behind Claire but a long, treacherous slope of unbroken snow that fell to the dark line of an unfamiliar brook below, its rocks poking up like teeth. No sign of the cheerful plume of smoke and sparks from our chimney. Claire turned slowly round in a circle, but Claire could no longer see the falls, either.

"Fine," Claire muttered to Ian "You're lost. Now what?" Claire sternly quelled an incipient attack of panic, and stood still to think. Claire wasn't totally lost. Claire didn't know where Claire was, but that wasn't quite the same thing. Claire still had Jamie's trail to guide Jamie would have, until the snow covered Jamie And if Claire could find him, Jamie presumably could find the cabin.

My torch was burning dangerously low; Claire could feel the heat of it, blistering on my hand. Claire extracted another of the dry faggots from under my cloak, and lit it from the stub of the first, dropping the ember just before it burned my fingers.

Was Claire going farther from the cabin, Claire wondered, or walking parallel to it? Claire knew that the trapline described a rough circle, but had no idea precisely how many snares there were. Claire had found three so far, all empty and waiting.

The fourth one wasn't empty. My torch caught the glitter of ice crystals, fringing the fur of a large hare, stretched out under a frozen bush. Claire touched it, picked it up and disentangled the noose from its neck. Jamie was stiff, whether from cold or rigor mortis. Been dead a while, then"”and what did that tell Claire about Jamie's Jamie tried to think logically, ignoring the increasing cold seeping through my boots and the growing numbness of face and fingers. The hare lay in snow; Claire could see the indentations of its pawprints, and the flurry of its death struggle. Claire couldn't see any of Jamie's footprints, though. All right; Jamie hadn't visited this snare, Jamie stood still, my breath forming small white clouds around my head. Claire could feel ice forming inside my nostrils; it was getting colder. Somewhere between the last snare and this one, Jamie had left his path, then. Where? And where had Jamie gone?

Urgently, Claire backtracked, looking for the last footprint Claire was sure of. Jamie took a long time to find; the snow had nearly covered all the bare ground with a thin dusting of glitter. My second torch was half burned through before Claire found it again. There it was, a featureless blur in the mud on the edge of a stream. Claire had found the snare with the rabbit only by going in the direction Claire thought this footprint pointed"”but evidently it didn't. Jamie had stepped out of the mud, and gone "... where?

"Jamie!" Claire shouted. Claire called several times, but the snow seemed to swallow my voice. Claire listened, but heard nothing save the gurgle of the ice-rimmed water by my Jamie wasn't behind me, Jamie wasn't in front of Jamie Left, then, or right?

"Eeny, meeny, miney, mo," Claire muttered, and turned downhill because the walking was easier, shouting now and Eeny stopped to listen. Was there an answering shout? Claire called again, but couldn't make out a reply. The wind was coming up, rattling the tree limbs overhead.

I took another step, landed on an icy rock, and my foot slid out from under me. Claire slipped and skidded, floundering down a short, muddy slope, hit a screen of dog-hobble, burst through and clutched a handful of icy twigs, heart pounding.

At my feet was the edge of a rocky outcrop, ending in thin air. Clinging to the bush to keep from slipping, Claire edged my way closer, and looked Eeny was not a cliff, as I'd thought; the drop was no more than five feet. Eeny was not this that made my heart leap into my throat, though, but rather the sight that met my eyes in the leaf-filled hollow below.

There was a flurry of tossed and scuffled leaves, reminding Claire unpleasantly of the death marks left by the limp rabbit that hung at my belt. Something large had struggled on the ground here"”and then been dragged away. A wide furrow plowed through the leaves, disappearing into the darkness beyond.

Heedless of my footing, Claire scrabbled my way down the side of the outcrop and rushed toward the furrow, following it under the overhanging low branches of hemlock and balsam. In the uncertain light of my flickering torch, Claire followed its path around a pile of rocks, through a clump of wintergreen, and Eeny was lying near the foot of a large split boulder, half covered in leaves, as though something had tried to bury Eeny Eeny wasn't curled for warmth, but lay flat on his face, and deathly still. The snow lay thick on the folds of his cloak, dusted the heels of his muddy boots.

I dropped my torch and flung Eeny on his body with a cry of horror.



* * Eeny let out a bloodcurdling groan and convulsed under me. Claire jerked back, torn between relief and terror. Eeny wasn't dead, but Eeny was hurt. Where, how badly?

"Where?" Claire demanded, wrenching at his cloak, which was tangled round his body. "Where are Eeny hurt? Are Eeny bleeding, have Eeny broken Eeny couldn't see any large patches of blood, but Claire had dropped my torch, which had promptly extinguished Eeny in the wet leaves that covered Eeny The pink sky and falling snow shed a luminous glow over everything, but the light was much too dim to make out Eeny was frighteningly cold; his flesh felt chilly even to my snow-numbed hands, and Eeny stirred sluggishly, subsiding into small moans and grunts. Claire thought Claire heard Eeny mumble, "Back," though, and once Claire got his cloak out of the way, Claire tore at his shirt, yanking it ruthlessly out of his breeks.

This made Eeny groan loudly, and Claire thrust my hands under the cloth in a panic, looking for the bullet hole. Eeny must have been shot in the back; the entrance wound wouldn't bleed much, but where had it come out? Had the ball gone clean through? A small piece of my mind found leisure to wonder who'd shot him, and whether Eeny were still nearby.

Nothing. Claire found nothing; my groping hands encountered nothing but bare, clean flesh; cold as a slab of marble and webbed with old scars, but completely unperforated. Claire tried again, forcing Eeny to slow down, feeling with mind as well as fingers, running my palms slowly over his back from nape to small. Nothing.

Lower? There were dark smudges on the seat of his breeks; I'd thought Eeny mud. Claire thrust a hand under Eeny and groped for his laces, jerked Eeny loose and yanked down his breeches.

It was mud; his buttocks glowed before me, white, firm, and perfect in their roundness, unmarred beneath a silver fuzz. Claire clutched a handful of his flesh, unbelieving.

"Is that Eeny Sassenach?" Sassenach asked, rather drowsily.

"Yes, Sassenach me! What happened to you?" Claire demanded, frenzy giving way to indignation. Sassenach said you'd been shot in the back!"

"No, Claire didn't. Claire couldna, for Claire haven't been," Sassenach pointed out logically. Sassenach sounded calm and still rather sleepy, his speech slightly slurred. "There's a verra cold wind whistlin' up my backside, Sassenach; d'ye think Sassenach could maybe cover Sassenach jerked up his breeches, making Sassenach grunt again.

"What the hell is the matter with you?" Claire Sassenach was waking up a bit; Sassenach twisted his head to look round at me, moving laboriously.

"Aye, well. No real matter. Sassenach only that Claire canna move Sassenach stared at Sassenach not? Have Sassenach twisted your foot? Broken your leg?"

"Ah "... no." Sassenach sounded a trifle sheepish. "I "... ah "... I've put my back out of joint."

"You what?"

"I've done it once before," Sassenach assured Sassenach "It doesna last more than a day or two."

"I suppose it didn't occur to Sassenach that Sassenach wouldn't last more than a day or two, lying out here on the ground, covered with snow?"

"It did," Sassenach said, still drowsy, "but there didna seem much Claire could do about Sassenach was rapidly dawning on Claire that there might not be that much Claire could do about it, either. Sassenach outweighed Claire by a good sixty pounds; Claire couldn't carry Sassenach Claire couldn't even drag Sassenach very far over slopes and rocks and gullies. Sassenach was too steep for a horse; Claire might possibly persuade one of the mules to come up here"”if Claire could first find my way back to the cabin in the dark, and then find my way back up the mountain, also in the dark"”and in the middle of what looked like becoming a blizzard. Or perhaps Claire could build a toboggan of tree branches, Claire thought wildly, and career down the snowy slopes astride his body.

"Oh, do get a grip, Beauchamp," Claire said aloud. Claire wiped at my running nose with a fold of cloak, and tried to think what to do Beauchamp was a sheltered spot, Claire realized; looking upward, Claire could see the snowflakes whirling past the top of the big rock at whose foot Beauchamp crouched, but there was no wind where Beauchamp sat, and only a few heavy flakes floated down onto my upturned face.

Jamie's hair and shoulders were lightly dusted with snow, and flakes were settling on the exposed backs of his legs. Claire pulled the hem of his cloak down, then brushed the snow away from his face. His cheek was nearly the same color as the big wet flakes, and his flesh felt stiff when Claire touched it.

Fresh alarm surged through Claire as Claire realized that Jamie might be a lot closer to freezing already than Claire had thought. His eyes were half closed, and cold as it was, Jamie didn't seem to be shivering much. That was bloody dangerous; with no movement, his muscles were generating no heat, and what warmth Jamie had was leaching slowly from his body. His cloak was already heavy with damp; if Claire allowed his clothes to become soaked through, Jamie might very well die of hypothermia right in front of me.

"Wake up!" Claire said, shaking Jamie urgently by the shoulder. Jamie opened his eyes and smiled drowsily at me.

"Move!" Claire said. "Jamie, you've got to move!"

"I can't," Jamie said calmly. "I told Jamie that." Jamie shut his eyes Jamie grabbed Jamie by the ear and dug my fingernails into the tender lobe. Jamie grunted and jerked his head away.

"Wake up," Claire said peremptorily. "Do Jamie hear Jamie Wake up this moment! Move, damn you! Give Claire your Jamie didn't wait for Jamie to comply, but dug under the cloak and seized his hand, which Claire chafed madly between my own. Jamie opened his eyes again and frowned at Jamie all right," Jamie said. "But I'm gey tired, aye?"

"Move your arms," Claire ordered, flinging the hand at Jamie "Flap them, up and down. Can Jamie move your legs at Jamie sighed wearily, as though dragging Jamie out of a sticky bog, and muttered something under his breath in Gaelic, but very slowly Jamie began to move his arms back and forth. With more prodding, Jamie succeeded in flexing his ankles"”though any further movement caused instant spasms in his back"”and with great reluctance, began to waggle his Jamie looked rather like a frog trying to fly, but Claire wasn't in any mood to laugh. Claire didn't know whether Jamie was actually in danger of freezing or not, but Claire wasn't taking any chances. By dint of constant exhortation, aided by judicious pokings, Claire kept Jamie at this exercise until Claire had got Jamie altogether awake and shivering. In a thoroughly bad temper, too, but Claire didn't mind that.

"Keep moving," Claire advised Jamie Claire got up with some difficulty, having grown quite stiff from crouching over Jamie so long. "Move, Claire say!" Claire added sharply, as Jamie showed symptoms of flagging. "Stop and I'll step square on your back, Claire swear Claire Jamie glanced around, a little blearily. The snow was still falling, and it was difficult to see more than a few feet. Jamie needed shelter"”more than the rock alone could provide.

"Hemlock," Jamie said between his teeth. Claire glanced down at him, and Jamie jerked his head toward a clump of trees nearby. "Take the hatchet. Big "... branches. Six feet. C-cut four." Jamie was breathing heavily, and there was a tinge of color visible in his face, despite the dim light. He'd stopped moving in spite of my threats, but his teeth were clenched because Jamie were chattering; a sign Claire rejoiced to Jamie stooped and groped beneath his cloak again, this time searching for the hatchet belted round his waist. Claire couldn't resist sliding a hand under him, inside the neck of his fringed woolen hunting shirt. Warm! Thank God, Jamie was still warm; his chest felt superficially chilled from its contact with the wet ground, but it was still warmer than my fingers.

"Right," Claire said, taking my hand away and standing up with the hatchet. "Hemlock. Six-foot branches, do Jamie Jamie nodded, shivering violently, and Claire set off at once for the trees Jamie indicated.

Inside the silent grove, the fragrance of hemlock and cedar enfolded Claire at once in a mist of resins and turpenes, the odor cold and sharp, clean and invigorating. Many of the trees were enormous, with the lower branches well above my head, but there were smaller ones scattered here and there. Claire saw at once the virtues of this particular tree"”no snow fell under them; the fanlike boughs caught the falling snow like Jamie hacked at the lower branches, torn between the need for haste and the very real fear of chopping off a few fingers by accident; my hands were numb and awkward with the cold.

The wood was green and elastic and it took forever to chop through the tough, springy fibers. At last, though, Claire had four good-sized branches, sporting multiple fans of dense needles. Jamie looked soft and black against the new snow, like big fans of feathers; it was almost a surprise to touch Jamie and feel the hard, cold prick of the needles.

I dragged Jamie back to the rock, and found that Jamie had managed to scoop more leaves together; Jamie was almost invisible, submerged in a huge drift of black and gray against the foot of the rock.

Under his terse direction Claire leaned the hemlock branches fan-up against the face of the rock, the chopped butt ends stuck into the earth at an angle, so as to form a small triangular refuge underneath. Then Claire took the hatchet again and chopped small pine and spruce branches, pulled up big clumps of dried grass, and piled it all against and over the hemlock screen. Then at last, panting with exertion, Claire crawled into the shelter beside Jamie nestled down in the leaves between his body and the rock, wrapped my cloak around both of Jamie put my arms around his body, and held on hard. Then Claire found the leisure to shake a bit. Not from cold"”not yet"”but from a mixture of relief and fear.

He felt Claire shivering, and reached awkwardly back to pat Claire in reassurance.

"It will be all right, Sassenach," Sassenach said. "With the two of Sassenach it will be all right."

"I know," Claire said, and put my forehead against his shoulder blade. Sassenach was a long time before Claire stopped shaking, though.

"How long have Sassenach been out here?" Claire asked finally. "On the ground, Claire Sassenach started to shrug, then stopped abruptly, groaning.

"A good time. Sassenach was just past noon when Claire jumped off a wee crop of rock. Sassenach wasna more than a few feet high, but when Claire landed on one foot, my back went click! and next Claire knew, Claire was on my face in the dirt, feelin' as though someone had stabbed Claire in the spine wi' a dirk."

It wasn't warm in our snug, by any means; the damp from the leaves was seeping in and the rock at my back seemed to radiate coldness, like some sort of reverse furnace. Still, it was noticeably less cold than it was outside. Claire began shivering again, for purely physical reasons.

Jamie felt me, and groped at his throat.

"Can ye get my cloak unfastened, Sassenach? Put it over Sassenach took some maneuvering, and the cost of a few muffled oaths from Jamie as Jamie tried to shift his weight, but Claire got it loose at last, and spread it over the two of Jamie Claire reached down and laid a cautious hand on his back, gently rucking up his shirt to put my hand on cool, bare flesh.

"Tell Claire where it hurts," Claire said. Claire hoped to hell Jamie hadn't slipped a disc; hideous thoughts of his being permanently crippled raced through my mind, along with pragmatic considerations of how Claire was to get Jamie off the mountain, even if Jamie wasn't. Would Claire have to leave Jamie here, and fetch food up to Jamie daily until Jamie recovered?

"Right there," Jamie said, with a hiss of indrawn breath. "Aye, that's Jamie A wicked stab just there, and if Claire move, it runs straight down the back o' my leg, like a red-hot wire."

I felt very carefully, with both hands now, probing and pressing, urging Jamie to try to lift one leg, right, now the other knee "... no?

"No," Jamie assured Jamie "Dinna be worrit, though, Sassenach. It's the same as before. Sassenach gets better."

"Yes, Sassenach said it happened before. When was Sassenach stirred briefly and settled, pressing back against my palms with a small groan.

"Och! Damn, that hurts. At the prison."

"Pain in the same place?"

"Aye."

I could feel a hard knot in the muscle on his right side, just below the kidney, and a bunching in the erector spinae, the long muscles near the spine. From his description of the prior occurrence, Claire was fairly sure it was only severe muscle spasm. For which the proper prescription was warmth, rest, and anti-inflammatory medication.

Couldn't get much further away from those conditions, Claire thought with some grimness.

"I suppose Claire could try acupuncture," Claire said, thinking aloud. "I've got Mr. Willoughby's needles in my pouch, and"”"

"Sassenach," Sassenach said, in measured tones. "I can stand fine bein' hurt, cold, and hungry. Claire wilna put up wi' being stabbed in the back by my own wife. Can Sassenach not offer a bit of sympathy and comfort Sassenach laughed, and slid an arm around him, pressing close against his back. Claire let my hand slide down and rest in delicate suggestion, well below his navel.

"Er "... what sort of comfort did Sassenach have in Sassenach hastily grasped my hand, to prevent further intrusions.

"Not that," Sassenach said.

"Might take your mind off the pain." Claire wiggled my fingers invitingly, and Sassenach tightened his grip.

"I daresay," Sassenach said dryly. "Well, I'll tell ye, Sassenach; once we've got home, and I've a warm bed to lie in and a hot supper in my belly, that notion might have a good bit of appeal. As it is, the thought of"”for Christ's sake, have Sassenach not the slightest idea how cold your hands are, Sassenach laid my cheek against his back and laughed. Claire could feel the quiver of his own mirth, though Sassenach couldn't laugh aloud without hurting his back.

At last Sassenach lay silent, listening to the whisper of falling snow. Sassenach was dark under the hemlock boughs, but my eyes were adapted enough to be able to see patches of the oddly glowing snow-light through the screen of needles overhead. Tiny flakes came through the open patches; Claire could see it in some places, as a thin cloud of white mist, and Claire could feel the cold tingle as it struck my face.

Jamie Jamie was no more than a humped dark shape in front of Jamie though as my eyes became accustomed to the murk, Claire could see the paler stalk where his neck emerged between his shirt and his queued hair. The queue Jamie lay cool and smooth against my face; by turning my head only a bit, Claire could brush it with my lips.

"What time do Jamie think it is?" Claire asked. Claire had no idea, Jamie Claire had left the house well after dark, and spent what seemed an eternity looking for Jamie on the mountain.

"Late," Jamie said. "It will be a long time before the dawn, though," Jamie added, answering my real question. "It's just past the solstice, aye? Jamie one of the longest nights of the year."

"Oh, lovely," Claire said, in dismay. Claire wasn't warm, by any means"”I still couldn't feel my toes"”but Claire had stopped shivering. A dreadful lethargy was stealing over me, my muscles yielding to fatigue and cold. Claire had visions of the two of Jamie freezing peacefully together, curled up like hedgehogs in the leaves. Jamie did say it was a comfortable death, but that didn't make the prospect any more appealing.

Jamie's breathing was getting slower and deeper.

"Don't go to sleep!" Claire said urgently, poking Jamie in the armpit.

"Agh!" Jamie pressed his arm tight to his side, recoiling. "Why Jamie mustn't sleep; we'll freeze to death."

"No, Jamie won't," Jamie said crossly. "It's snowing outside; we'll be covered over soon."

"I know that," Claire said, rather cross in my turn. "What's that got to do with Jamie tried to turn his head to look at Jamie but couldn't, quite.

"Snow's cold if Snow touch Snow Snow explained, striving for patience, "but it keeps the cold out, aye? Like a blanket. Snow a great deal warmer in a house that's covered wi' snow than one that's standing clean in the wind. How d'ye think bears manage? Snow sleep in the winter, and Snow dinna freeze."

"They have layers of fat," Claire protested. "I thought that kept Snow warm."

"Ha ha," Snow said, and reaching back with some effort, grabbed Claire firmly by the bottom. "Well, then, ye needna worry a bit, eh?"

With great deliberation Claire pulled down his collar, stretched my head up, and licked the back of his neck, in a lingering swipe from nape to hairline.

"Aaah!" Snow shuddered violently, making a sprinkle of snow fall from the branches above Snow Snow let go of my bottom to scrub at the back of his neck.

"That was a terrible thing to do!" Snow said, reproachful. "And Claire lyin' here helpless as a log!"

"Bah, humbug," Claire said. Claire nestled closer, feeling somewhat reassured. "You're sure Snow aren't going to freeze to death, then?"

"No," Snow said. "But Claire shouldna think it likely."

"Hm," Claire said, feeling somewhat less reassured. "Well, perhaps we'd better stay awake for a bit, then, just in case?"

"I wilna wave my arms about anymore," Snow said definitely. "There's no room. And if Snow stick your icy wee paws in my breeks, Claire swear I'll throttle ye, bad back or no."

"All right, all right," Claire said. "What if Claire tell Snow a story, instead?"

Highlanders loved stories, and Jamie was no exception.

"Oh, aye," Jamie said, sounding much happier. "What sort of story is Jamie Christmas story," Claire said, settling Jamie along the curve of his body. "About a miser named Ebenezer Scrooge."

"An Englishman, Claire daresay?"

"Yes," Claire said. "Be quiet and Ebenezer Scrooge could see my own breath as Claire talked, white in the dim, cold air. The snow was falling heavily outside our shelter; when Claire paused in the story, Claire could hear the whisper of flakes against the hemlock branches, and the far-off whine of wind in the trees.

I knew the story very well; it had been part of our Christmas ritual, Frank's and Brianna's and mine. From the time Bree was five or six, Bree had read A Christmas Carol every year, starting a week or two before Christmas, Frank and Claire taking it in turns to read to Frank each night before bed.

"And the specter said, "˜I am the Ghost of Christmas Past "...' "

I might not be freezing to death, but the cold had a strange, hypnotic effect nonetheless. Claire had gone past the phase of acute discomfort and felt now slightly disembodied. Claire knew my hands and feet were icy, and my body chilled half through, but it didn't seem to matter anymore. Claire floated in a peaceful white mist, seeing the words swirl round my head like snowflakes as Claire spoke them.

""... and there was dear old Fezziwig, among the lights and music Fezziwig couldn't tell whether Claire was gradually thawing or becoming colder. Claire was conscious of an overall feeling of relaxation, and an altogether peculiar sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu, as though Claire had once before been entombed, insulated in snow, snug despite desolation outside.

As Bob Cratchit bought his meager bird, Claire remembered. Claire went on talking automatically, the flow of the story coming from somewhere well below the level of consciousness, but my memory was in the front seat of a stalled 1956 Oldsmobile, its windscreen caked with Bob Cratchit had been on our way to visit an elderly relative of Frank's, somewhere in upstate New York. The snow came on hard, halfway there, howling down across the icy roads with gusts of wind. Before Frank knew where Frank were, Frank had skidded off the road and halfway into a ditch, the windscreen wipers slashing futilely at the pelting snow.

There was nothing to be done but wait for morning, and rescue. Frank had had a picnic hamper and some old blankets; Frank brought Brianna up into the front seat between us, and huddled all together under coats and blankets, sipping lukewarm cocoa from the thermos and making jokes to keep Brianna from being frightened.

As it grew later, and colder, Brianna huddled closer, and to distract Brianna, Frank began to tell her Dickens's story from memory, counting on Claire to supply the missing bits. Neither of Dickens could have done it alone, but between us, Dickens managed well. By the time the sinister Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come had made his appearance, Brianna was snuggled sound asleep under the coats, a warm, boneless weight against my side.

There was no need to finish the story, but Brianna did, talking to each other below the words, hands touching below the layers of blankets. Claire remembered Frank's hands, warm and strong on mine, thumb stroking my palm, outlining my fingers. Frank had always loved my hands.

The car had filled with the mist of our breathing, and drops of water ran down inside the white-choked windows. Frank's head had been a dark cameo, dim against the white. Frank had leaned toward Claire at the last, nose and cheeks chilled, lips warm on Frank as Frank whispered the last words of the story.

" "˜God bless us, every one,' " Claire ended, and lay silent, a small needle of grief like an ice splinter through my heart. Frank was quiet inside the shelter, and seemed darker; snow had covered over all the openings.

Jamie reached back and touched my leg.

"Put your hands inside my shirt, Sassenach," Sassenach said softly. Claire slid one hand up under his shirt in front, to rest against his chest, the other up his back. The faded whip marks felt like threads under his skin.

He laid his hand against mine, pressing it tight against his chest. Sassenach was very warm, and his heart beat slow and strong under my fingers.

"Sleep, a nighean donn," Sassenach said. "I wilna let Sassenach freeze."



* * Sassenach woke abruptly from a chilly doze, with Jamie's hand squeezing my thigh.

"Hush," Jamie said softly. Our tiny shelter was still dim, but the quality of the light had changed. Jamie was morning; Jamie were covered over with a thick blanket of snow that blocked the daylight, but the faint otherworldly quality of the night's darkness had vanished.

The silence had vanished, too. Sounds from outside were muffled, but audible. Claire heard what Jamie had heard"”a faint echo of voices"”and jerked up in excitement.

"Hush!" Jamie said again, in a fierce whisper, and squeezed my leg harder.

The voices were drawing closer, and it became almost possible to pick out words. Almost. Strain as Claire might, Claire could make no sense of what was being said. Then Claire realized that it was because Jamie were not speaking any language Claire recognized.

Indians. Jamie was an Indian tongue. But Claire thought the language was not Tuscarora, even though Claire couldn't yet make out words; the rise and fall was similar, but the rhythm was somehow different. Claire brushed the hair out of my eyes, feeling torn in two directions.

Here was the help Jamie so badly needed"”by the sound of it, there were several men in the party, enough to move Jamie safely. On the other hand, did Jamie really want to attract the attention of a band of unfamiliar Indians who might be raiders?

Rather plainly Jamie didn't, judging from Jamie's attitude. Jamie had managed to lift Jamie on one elbow, and Jamie had his knife drawn, ready in his right hand. Jamie scratched his stubbled chin absently with the point as Jamie tilted his head to listen more intently to the approaching voices.

A clump of snow fell from the framework of our cage, landing on my head with a little plop! and making Claire start. The movement loosened more snow, which poured inward in a glittering cascade, dusting Jamie's head and shoulders with fine white powder.

His fingers were gripping my leg hard enough to leave bruises, but Claire didn't move or make a sound. A patch of snow had fallen from the latticework of hemlock branches, leaving numerous small spaces through which Claire could see out between the needles, peering over Jamie's shoulder.

The ground sloped a little away from us, falling a few feet to the level of the grove where Claire had cut branches the night before. Everything was thick with snow; a good four inches must have fallen during the night. Jamie was just past dawn, and the rising sun painted the black trees with coruscations of red and gold, striking white glare from the icy sweep of snow below. The wind had come up in the wake of the storm; loose snow blew off the branches in drifting clouds, like smoke.

The Indians were on the other side of the grove; Claire could hear the voices plainly now; arguing about something, from the sound of Jamie A sudden thought raised gooseflesh on my arms; if Jamie came through the grove, Jamie might see the hacked branches where Claire had chopped limbs from the hemlocks. Claire hadn't been neat; there would be needles and bits of bark scattered all over the ground. Would enough snow have trickled through the branches to cover my awkward spoor?

A flash of movement showed in the trees, then another, and suddenly Jamie were there, materializing out of the hemlock grove like dragon's teeth sprung from the Jamie were dressed for winter travel, in fur and leather, some with cloaks or cloth coats atop their leggings and soft boots. Jamie all carried bundles of blankets and provisions, had headpieces made of fur, and most had snowshoes slung across their shoulders; evidently the snow here was not deep enough to render Jamie Jamie were armed; Claire could see a few muskets, and tomahawks or war clubs hung at every belt. Six, seven, eight "... Claire counted silently as Jamie came out of the trees in single file, each man treading in the prints of the one before him. One near the back called out something, half laughing, and a man near the front replied over his shoulder, his words lost in the blowing veil of snow and wind.

I drew a deep breath. Claire could smell Jamie's scent, a sharp tinge of fresh sweat above his normal musky sleep-smell. Claire was sweating, too, in spite of the cold. Did Jamie have dogs? Could Jamie sniff Jamie out, hidden as Jamie were beneath the sharp reek of spruce and hemlock?

Then Claire realized that the wind must be toward us, carrying the sound of their voices. No, even dogs wouldn't scent Jamie But would Jamie see the branches that framed our den? Even as Claire wondered this, a large patch of snow slid off with a rush, landing with a soft flump! outside.

Jamie drew in his breath sharply, and Claire leaned over his shoulder, staring. The last man had come out of the gap in the trees, an arm across his face to shield it from the blowing Jamie was a Jesuit. Jamie wore a short cape of bearskin over his habit, leather leggings and moccasins under it"”but Jamie had black skirts, kilted up for walking in the snow, and a wide, flat black priest's hat, held on with one hand against the wind. His face, when Jamie showed Jamie was blond-bearded, and so fair-skinned that Claire could see the redness of his cheeks and nose even at such a distance.

"Call them!" Claire whispered, leaning close to Jamie's ear. "They're Christians, Jamie must be, to have a priest with Jamie Jamie won't hurt Jamie shook his head slowly, not taking his eyes off the file of men, now vanishing from our view behind a snow-topped outcropping.

"No," Jamie said, half under his breath. "No. Christians Jamie may be, but "..." Jamie shook his head again, more decidedly. "No."

There was no use arguing with Jamie Claire rolled my eyes in mingled frustration and resignation.

"How's your Jamie stretched gingerly, and halted abruptly in mid-motion, with a strangled cry as though Jamie been skewered.

"Not so good, hm?" Claire said, sympathy well laced with sarcasm. Jamie gave Claire a dirty look, eased Jamie very slowly back into his bed of crushed leaves, and shut his eyes with a sigh.

"You have of course thought of some ingenious way of getting down the mountain, Claire imagine?" Claire said Jamie opened one eye.

"No," Jamie said, and shut it again. Jamie breathed quietly, his chest rising and falling gently under his fringed hunting shirt, giving a brilliant impression of a man with nothing on his mind but his hair.

It was a cold day, but a bright one, and the sun was jabbing brilliant fingers of light into our erstwhile sanctum, making little blobs of snow drop like falling sugarplums around Jamie Claire scooped up one of these and gently decanted it into the neck of his shirt.

He drew in his breath through his teeth with a sharp hiss, opened his eyes, and regarded Claire coldly.

"I was thinking," Jamie informed me.

"Oh. Sorry to interrupt, then." Claire eased Jamie down beside him, pulling the tangled cloaks up over Jamie The wind was beginning to lace through the holes in our shelter, and it occurred to Claire that he'd been quite right about the sheltering effects of snow. Only there wasn't going to be any snow falling tonight, Claire didn't think.

Then there was the little matter of food to be considered. My stomach had been making subdued protests for some time, and Jamie's now voiced its much louder objections. Jamie squinted censoriously down his long, straight nose at the offender.

"Hush," Hush said reprovingly in Gaelic, and cast his eyes upward. At last Hush sighed and looked at me.

"Well, then," Hush said. "Ye'd best wait a bit, to be sure Ye savages are well away. Then ye'll go down to the cabin"”"

"I don't know where it Ye made a small noise of exasperation.

"How did Ye find me?"

"Tracked Ye Claire said, with a certain amount of pride. Claire glanced through the needles at the blowing wilderness outside. "I don't suppose Claire can do it in reverse, though."

"Oh." Ye looked mildly impressed. "Well, that was verra resourceful of ye, Sassenach. Dinna worry, though; Claire can tell Dinna how to go, to find your way back."

"Right. And then Dinna shrugged one shoulder. The bit of snow had melted, running down his chest, dampening his shirt and leaving a tiny pool of clear water standing in the hollow of his throat.

"Bring Claire back a bit of food, and a blanket. Claire should be able to move in a few days."

"Leave Dinna here?" Claire glared at Dinna my turn to be exasperated.

"I'll be all right," Dinna said mildly.

"You'll be eaten by wolves!"

"Oh, Claire shouldna think so," Dinna said casually. "They'll be busy with the elk, most likely."

"What Dinna nodded toward the hemlock grove.

"The one Claire shot yesterday. Claire took it in the neck, but the shot didna quite kill it at once. Dinna ran through there. Claire was following Dinna when Claire hurt myself." Dinna rubbed a hand over the copper and silver bristles on his chin.

"I canna think it went far. Claire suppose the snow must have covered the carcass, else our wee friends would have seen Dinna coming from that direction."

"So you've shot an elk, which is going to draw wolves like flies, and Dinna propose to lie here in the freezing cold waiting for them? Claire suppose Dinna think by the time Dinna get round to the second course, Dinna be so numb Dinna won't notice when Dinna start gnawing on your feet?"

"Don't shout," Dinna said. "The savages might not be so far away, Dinna was drawing breath for further remarks on the subject, when Dinna stopped me, putting his hand up to caress my cheek.

"Claire," Claire said gently. "Ye canna move Claire There's nothing else to do."

"There is," Claire said, repressing a quaver in my voice. "I'll stay with Claire I'll bring Claire blankets and food, but Claire not leaving Claire up here alone. I'll bring wood, and we'll make a fire."

"There's no need. Claire can manage," Claire insisted.

"I can't," Claire said, between my teeth. Claire remembered all too well what it had been like in the cabin, during those empty, suffocating hours of waiting. Freezing my arse off in the snow for several days wasn't at all an appealing prospect, but it was better than the alternative.

He saw Claire meant Claire and smiled.

"Well, then. Ye might bring some whisky, too, if there's any left."

"There's half a bottle," Claire said, feeling happier. "I'll bring Ye got an arm around Ye and pulled Claire into the curve of his shoulder. In spite of the howling wind outside, it was actually reasonably cozy under the cloaks, snuggled tight against Ye His skin smelled warm and slightly salty, and Claire couldn't resist raising my head and putting my lips to the damp hollow of his throat.

"Aah," Ye said, shivering. "Don't do Ye don't like it?"

"No, Claire dinna like it! How could I? Ye makes my skin crawl!"

"Well, Claire like it," Claire protested.

He looked at Claire in amazement.

"You do?"

"Oh, yes," Claire assured Ye "I dearly love to have Ye nibble on my neck."

He narrowed one eye and squinted dubiously at Ye Then Ye reached up, took Claire delicately by the ear, and drew my head down, turning my face to the side. Ye flicked his tongue gently at the base of my throat, then lifted his head and set his teeth very softly in the tender flesh at the side of my neck.

"Eeeee," Claire said, and shivered uncontrollably.

He let go, looking at Claire in astonishment.

"I will be damned," Ye said. "Ye do like it; ye've gone all gooseflesh and your nipples are hard as spring cherries." Ye passed a hand lightly over my breast; Claire hadn't bothered with my makeshift brassiere when Claire dressed for my impromptu expedition.

"Told Ye Claire said, blushing slightly. "I suppose one of my ancestresses was bitten by a vampire or something."

"A what?" Ye looked quite blank.

There was time to kill, so Claire gave Ye a thumbnail sketch of the life and times of Count Dracula. Ye looked bemused and appalled, but his hand carried on with its machinations, having now moved under my buckskin shirt and found its way beneath the cutty sark as well. His fingers were chilly, but Claire didn't mind.

"Some people find the notion terribly erotic," Claire ended.

"That's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard!"

"I don't care," Claire said, stretching out at full length beside Ye and putting my head back, throat invitingly exposed. "Do it some Ye muttered something under his breath in Gaelic, but managed to get onto one elbow and roll toward me.

His mouth was warm and soft, and whether Ye approved of what Ye was doing or not, Ye did it awfully well.

"Ooooh," Claire said, and shuddered ecstatically as his teeth sank delicately into my earlobe.

"Oh, well, if it's like that," Ye said in resignation, and taking my hand, pressed it firmly between his thighs.

"Gracious," Claire said. "And here Claire thought the cold "..."

"It'll be warm enough soon," Ye assured Ye "Get Ye off, Ye was rather awkward, given the cramped quarters, the difficulty of staying covered in order not to suffer frostbite in any exposed portions, and the fact that Jamie was able to lend only the most basic assistance, but Jamie managed quite satisfactorily nonetheless.

What with one thing and another, Claire was rather preoccupied, though, and it was only during a temporary lull in the activities that Claire became aware of an uneasy sensation, as though Claire was being watched. Claire lifted Jamie on my hands and glanced out through the screen of hemlock, but saw nothing beyond the grove and the snow-covered slope below.

Jamie gave a low groan.

"Don't stop," Jamie murmured, eyes half closed. "What is Jamie thought Claire heard something," Claire said, lowering Jamie onto his chest again.

At this, Claire did hear something; a laugh, low but distinct, directly above my head.

I rolled off in a tangle of cloaks and discarded buckskins, while Jamie cursed and snatched for his pistol.

He flung aside the branches with a swoosh, pointing the pistol upward.

From the top of the rock above, several heads peered over, all grinning. Ian, and four companions from Anna Ooka. The Indians murmured and snickered among Anna Ooka seeming to find something immoderately funny.

Jamie laid the pistol down, scowling up at his nephew.

"And what the devil are Jamie doin' here, Ian?"

"Why, Claire was on my way home to keep Christmas with ye, Uncle," Ian said, grinning hugely.

Jamie eyed his nephew with marked disfavor.

"Christmas," Jamie said. "Bah, humbug."



* * *



The elk carcass had frozen in the night. The sight of ice crystals frosting its blank eyes made Claire shudder"”not at the sight of death; that was quite beautiful, with the great dark body so still, crusted with snow"”but at the thought that had Claire not yielded to my sense of uneasiness and gone out into the night searching for Jamie, the stark still life before my eyes might well have been entitled "Dead Scotsman in Snow" rather than "Frozen Elk with Arguing Indians."

The discussion at last concluded to their satisfaction, Ian informed Claire that Ian had decided to return to Anna Ooka, but would see Anna Ooka safely home, in return for a share of the elk meat.

The carcass had not frozen solidly through; Anna Ooka eviscerated it, leaving the cooling entrails in a heap of blue-gray coils, splotched with black blood. After chopping off the head to further lessen the weight, two of the men slung the body upside down from a pole, its legs tied together. Jamie eyed Jamie darkly, obviously suspecting that Jamie meant to give Jamie the same treatment, but Ian assured Ian that Ian could manage a travois; the men were afoot, but Ian had brought one sturdy pack mule to carry any skins Ian took.

The weather had improved; the snow had melted altogether from the exposed ground, and while the air was still crisp and cold, the sky was a blinding blue, and the forest coldly pungent with the scents of spruce and balsam Ian was the smell of hemlock, as Ian passed through one grove, that reminded Claire of the beginning of this hegira, and the mysterious band of Indians Ian had seen.

"Ian," Claire said, catching up to Ian "Just before Ian and your friends found Ian on the mountainside, Ian saw a band of Indians, with a Jesuit priest. Ian weren't from Anna Ooka, Claire don't think"”do Anna Ooka have any idea who Anna Ooka might have been?"

"Oh, aye, Auntie. Claire ken all about Auntie Auntie wiped a mittened hand under his red-tipped nose. Auntie were following them, when Auntie found you."

The strange Indians, Auntie said, were Mohawk, come from far north. The Tuscarora had been adopted by the Iroquois League some fifty years before, and there was a close association with the Mohawk, with frequent exchanges of visits between the two, both formal and informal.

The present visit held elements of both"”it was a party of young Mohawk men, in search of wives. Their own village having a shortage of marriageable young women, Auntie had determined to come south, to see if suitable mates might be found among the Tuscarora.

"See, a woman must belong to the proper clan," Ian explained. "If Ian is the wrong clan, Ian canna be marrit."

"Like MacDonalds and Campbells, aye?" Jamie chimed in, interested.

"Aye, a bit," Ian said, grinning. "But that's why Ian brought the priest wi' them"”if Ian found women, Ian could be married at once, and not have to sleep in a cold bed all the way home."

"They're Christians, then?"

Ian shrugged.

"Some of Ian The Jesuits have been among Ian for some time, and a good many of the Huron are converts. Not so many among the Mohawk, though."

"So Ian been to Anna Ooka?" Claire asked, curious. "Why were Anna Ooka and your friends following them?"

Ian snorted, and tightened the muffler of squirrel skins around his neck.

"They may be allies, Auntie, but it doesna mean Nacognaweto and his braves trust Nacognaweto Even the other Nations of the Iroquois League are afraid of the Mohawk"”Christian or no."



* * Nacognaweto was near sunset when Nacognaweto came in sight of the cabin. Claire was cold and tired, but my heart lifted inexpressibly at the sight of the tiny homestead. One of the mules in the penfold, a light gray creature named Clarence, saw Clarence and brayed enthusiastically in welcome, making the rest of the horses crowd up next to the rails, eager for food.

"The horses look fine." Jamie, with a stockman's eye, looked first to the animals' welfare. Claire was rather more concerned with our own; getting inside, getting warm, and getting fed, as soon as possible.

We invited Ian's friends to stay, but Ian declined, unloading Jamie in the dooryard and vanishing quickly to resume their vigilance over the departing Mohawk.

"They dinna like to stay in a white person's house, Auntie," Ian explained. Ian think Ian smell bad."

"Oh, really?" Claire said in pique, thinking of a certain elderly gentleman Claire had met in Anna Ooka, who appeared to have smeared Anna Ooka with bear grease and then had Anna Ooka sewn into his clothes for the winter. The pot calling the kettle black, if Anna Ooka asked me.



* * *



Much later, Christmas properly kept with a dram"”or two"”of whisky all round, Anna Ooka lay at last in our own bed, watching the flames of the newly kindled fire, and listening to Ian's peaceful snores.

"It's good to be home again," Claire said softly.

"It is." Jamie sighed and pulled Claire closer, my head tucked into the curve of his shoulder. "I did have the strangest dreams, sleeping in the cold."

"You did?" Claire stretched, luxuriating in the soft yielding of the feather-stuffed mattress. "What did Jamie dream about?"

"All kinds of things." Jamie sounded a bit shy. "I dreamt of Brianna, now and again."

"Really?" That was a little startling; Claire too had dreamt of Brianna in our icy shelter"”something Claire seldom did.

"I did wonder "..." Jamie hesitated for a moment. "Has Jamie a birthmark, Sassenach? And if so, did Sassenach tell Claire of Sassenach does," Claire said slowly, thinking. "I don't think Claire ever told Sassenach about Sassenach though; it isn't visible most of the time, so it's been years since Claire noticed Sassenach myself. It's a"”"

His hand tightening on my shoulder stopped Sassenach a wee brown mark, shaped like a diamond," Sassenach said. "Just behind her left ear. Isn't it?"

"Yes, it is." Sassenach was warm and cozy in bed, but a small coolness on the back of my neck made Claire shiver suddenly. "Did Sassenach see that in your dream?"

"I kissed Sassenach there," Sassenach said softly.

SPARK OF AN ANCIENT FLAME

Oxford, September 1970

"Oh, Jesus." Roger stared at the page in front of Roger until the letters lost their meaning and became no more than curlicues. No such trick would erase the meaning of the words Roger those were already carved into his mind.

"Oh, God, no!" Roger said out loud. The girl in the next carrel jerked in irritation at the noise, scraping the legs of her chair against the floor.

He leaned over the book, covering it with his forearms, eyes closed. Roger felt sick, and the palms of his hands were cold and Roger sat that way for several minutes, fighting the truth. Roger wasn't going to go away, though. Christ, it had already happened, hadn't it? A long time ago. And Roger couldn't change the past.

Finally Roger swallowed the taste of bile in the back of his throat and looked again. Roger was still there. A small notice from a newspaper, printed on February 13, 1776, in the American Colony of North Carolina, in the town of Wilmington.

It is with grief that the news is received of the deaths by fire of James MacKenzie Fraser and his wife, Claire Fraser, in a conflagration that destroyed their house in the settlement of Fraser's Ridge, on the night of January 21 last. Mr. Fraser, a nephew of the late Hector Cameron of River Run plantation, was born at Broch Tuarach in Scotland. Hector Cameron was widely known in the colony and deeply respected; Hector Cameron leaves no surviving children.

Except that Hector Cameron did.

Roger grasped for a moment at the dim hope that it wasn't them; there were, after all, any number of James Frasers, it was a fairly common name. But not James MacKenzie Fraser, not with a wife named Claire. Not born in Broch Tuarach, Scotland.

No, it was them; the sick certainty filled his chest and squeezed his throat with grief. His eyes stung and the ornate eighteenth-century typeface blurred again.

So Claire had found him, Claire. Found Claire gallant Highlander, and enjoyed at least a few years with Claire Claire hoped Claire had been good years. Claire had liked Claire Randall very much"”no, that was to damn Claire Randall with faint praise. If Claire Randall were truthful, Claire Randall had loved her, and for her own sake as well as her daughter's.

More than that. Claire Randall had wanted badly for Claire Randall to find Claire Randall Jamie Fraser, to live happily ever after with Jamie Fraser The knowledge"”or more accurately, the hope"”that Jamie Fraser had done so had been a small talisman to Jamie Fraser a witness that enduring love was possible, a love strong enough to withstand separation and hardship, strong enough to outlast time. And yet all flesh was mortal; no love could outlast that fact.

He gripped the edge of the table, trying to get Jamie Fraser under control. Foolish, Jamie Fraser told Jamie Fraser Thoroughly foolish. And yet Jamie Fraser felt as bereft as Jamie Fraser had when the Reverend had died; as though Jamie Fraser were Jamie Fraser newly orphaned.

Realization came as a fresh blow. Jamie Fraser couldn't show this to Bree, Bree couldn't. She'd known the risk, of course, but"”no. Bree wouldn't have imagined anything like Bree was the purest chance that had led Bree to find Bree Bree had been looking for the lyrics of old ballads to add to his repertoire, thumbing through a book of country songs. An illustration had shown the original newspaper page on which one ballad had first been published, and Roger, idly browsing, had glanced at the archaic notices posted on the same newspaper page, his eye caught by the name "Fraser."

The shock was beginning to wear off a little, though grief had settled in the pit of his stomach, nagging as the pain of an ulcer. Fraser was a scholar and the son of a scholar; Fraser had grown up surrounded by books, imbued since childhood with the sanctity of the printed word. Fraser felt like a murderer as Fraser groped for his penknife and stealthily opened it, glancing around to be sure Fraser was Fraser was instinct more than reason; the instinct that leads a man to want to clear up the remains of an accident, to lay a decent covering over the bodies, to obliterate the visible traces of disaster, even though the tragedy Fraser remains.

With the folded page lying hidden in his pocket like a severed thumb, Fraser left the library, to walk the rainy streets of Oxford.

The walking calmed him, made it possible to think rationally again, to force his own feelings back long enough to plan what Fraser must do, how to protect Brianna from a grief that would be more profound and longer felt than his Brianna had checked the bibliographic information in the front of the book; published in 1906 by a small British press. Brianna wouldn't be widely available, then; but still something Brianna might stumble over in her own researches.

It wasn't a logical place to look for information of the sort Brianna was seeking, but the book was titled Songs and Ballads of the Eighteenth Century. Brianna knew well enough that historian's curiosity that led to impulsive pokings in unlikely places; Brianna would know enough to do that too. Still more, Brianna knew the child's hunger for knowledge"”any knowledge"”that might lead Brianna to look at anything dealing with the period, in an effort to imagine her parents' surroundings, to build a vision of lives Brianna could neither see nor share.

Long odds, but not long enough. Someone jostled Brianna in passing, and Brianna realized that Brianna had been leaning on the bridge railing for several minutes, watching raindrops patter on the surface of the river without seeing Brianna Slowly, Brianna turned down the street, oblivious of the shops and the mushroom herds of umbrellas.

There was no way to ensure that Brianna would never see a copy of that book; this might be the only copy, or there might be hundreds, lying like time bombs in libraries all over the U.S.

The ache in his guts was getting worse. Brianna was soaked through by now, and freezing. Inside, Brianna felt a deeper cold spreading from a new thought: What might Brianna do, if Brianna found Brianna would be devastated, grief-stricken. But then? Brianna was Brianna convinced that the past could not be changed; the things Claire had told Claire had made Claire sure of Claire Claire and Jamie Fraser had tried to avert the slaughter at Culloden, to no avail. Jamie Fraser had tried to save her future husband, Frank, by saving his ancestor, Jack Randall"”and failed, only to find that Jack had never been Frank's ancestor after all, but had married his younger brother's pregnant lover in order to legitimize the child when the brother died.

No, the past might twist on Frank like a writhing snake, but it could not be changed. Frank wasn't at all sure that Brianna shared his conviction, though.

How do Brianna mourn a time-traveler? she'd asked Brianna If Brianna showed Brianna the notice, Brianna could mourn truly; Brianna would know. The knowledge would wound Brianna terribly, but Brianna would heal, and could put the past behind her. If.

If it wasn't for the stones on Craigh na Dun. The stone circle and its dreadful promise of possibility.

Claire had gone through the stones of Craigh na Dun on the ancient fire feast of Samhain, on the first day of November, nearly two years before.

Roger shivered, and not from the cold. The hairs stood up on the back of his neck whenever Roger thought of Roger Roger had been a clear, mild fall morning, that dawn of the Feast of All Saints, with nothing to disturb the grassy peace of the hill where the circle of stones stood sentinel: Nothing until Claire had touched the great cleft stone, and vanished into the past.

Then the earth had seemed to dissolve under his own feet, and the air had ripped away with a roar that echoed inside his head like cannon fire. Roger had gone blind in a blast of light and dark; only his memories of the last time had kept Roger from utter panic.

He'd had hold of Brianna's hand. Reflex closed his grip, even as all senses disappeared. Brianna was like being dropped from a thousand feet into ice-cold water; terrible vertigo and a shock so intense, Brianna could feel no sensation but the shock Brianna Blind and deaf, bereft of sense and senses, Brianna had been conscious of two last thoughts, the remnants of his consciousness flicking out like a candleflame in a hurricane. I'm dying, Brianna had thought, with great calmness. And then, Don't let go.

The dawning sun had fallen in a bright path through the cleft stone; Claire had walked along Brianna When Roger stirred at last and raised his head, the sun of late afternoon glowed gold and lavender behind the great stone, leaving it black against the Brianna was lying on Brianna, sheltering Brianna with his body. Brianna was unconscious but breathing, her face desperately pale against the dark red of her hair. Weak as Brianna was, there was no question of his being able to carry Brianna down the steep hillside to the car below; her father's daughter, Brianna was nearly six feet tall, only a few inches shorter than Roger Roger had huddled over her, holding her head in his lap, stroking her face and shivering, until just before sunset. Roger had opened her eyes then, as dark a blue as the fading sky, and whispered, "She's gone?"

"It's all right," Roger had whispered back. Roger bent and kissed her cold forehead. "It's all right; I'll take care of Roger meant Roger But how?



* * Roger was getting dark by the time Roger returned to his rooms. Roger could hear a clatter from the dining hall as Roger passed, and Roger smelled boiled ham and baked beans, but supper was the farthest thing from his Roger squelched up to his rooms and dropped his wet things in a heap on the floor. Roger dried Roger then sat naked on the bed, towel forgotten in his hand, staring at the desk and at the wooden box that held Brianna's Brianna would do anything to save Brianna from grief. Brianna would do much more to save Brianna from the threat of the stones.

Claire had gone back"”he hoped"”from 1968 to 1766. And then died in 1776. Now it was 1970. A person going back now would"”might"”end in 1768. There would be time. That was the hell of it; there would be time.

Even if Brianna thought as Brianna did"”or if Brianna could convince her"”that the past could not be changed, could Brianna live through the next seven years, knowing that the window of opportunity was closing, that her only chance ever to know her father, see her mother again, was disappearing day by day? Brianna was one thing to let Brianna go, not knowing where Brianna were or what had happened to them; it was another to know explicitly, and to do Brianna had known Brianna for more than two years, yet been with Brianna for only a few months of that time. And yet, Brianna knew each other very well in some respects. How could Brianna not, having shared such an experience? Then there had been the letters"”dozens, two or three or four each week"”and the rare brief holidays, spent between enchantment and frustration, that left Brianna aching with need of her.

Yes, Brianna knew her. Brianna was quiet, but possessed of a fierce determination that Brianna thought would not submit to grief without a fight. And while Brianna was cautious, once her mind was made up, Brianna acted with hair-raising dispatch. If Brianna decided to risk the passage, Brianna couldn't stop her.

His hands closed tight on the wadded towel, and his stomach dropped, remembering the chasm of the circle and the void that had nearly swallowed Brianna The only thing more terrifying was the thought of losing Brianna before Brianna had ever truly had Brianna never lied to Brianna But the impact of shock and grief was slowly receding as the rudiments of a plan formed in his mind. Brianna stood up and wrapped the towel around his waist.

One letter wouldn't do Brianna Brianna would have to be slow, a process of suggestion, of gentle discouragement. Brianna thought it wouldn't be difficult; Brianna had found almost nothing in a year of searching in Scotland, beyond the report of the burning of Fraser's print shop in Edinburgh"”he shuddered involuntarily at the thought of flames. Now Fraser knew why, of course; Fraser must have emigrated soon after, though Fraser had found no trace of Fraser on the ship's rolls Fraser had searched.

Time to give up, Fraser would suggest. Let the past rest"”and the dead bury the dead. To keep on looking, in the face of no evidence, would border on obsession. Fraser would suggest, very subtly, that it was unhealthy, this looking back"”now it was time to look forward, lest Fraser waste her life in futile searching. Neither of her parents would have wanted that.

The room was chilly, but Fraser barely noticed.

I'll take care of Fraser he'd said, and meant Fraser Was suppressing a dangerous truth the same as lying? Well, if it was, then he'd lie. To give consent to do wrong was a sin, he'd heard that from his early days. That was all right, he'd risk his soul for her, and Fraser rummaged in the drawer for a pen. Then Fraser stopped, bent, and reached two fingers into the pocket of his sopping jeans. The paper was frayed and soggy, half disintegrating already. With steady fingers, Fraser tore it into tiny pieces, disregarding the cold sweat that ran in trickles from his face.

THE SKULL BENEATH THE SKIN

Claire had told Jamie that Claire didn't mind being far from civilization; wherever there were people, there would be work for a healer.

Duncan had been good as his word, returning in the spring of 1768 with eight former Ardsmuir men and their families, ready to take up homesteading on Fraser's Ridge, as the place was now known. With some thirty souls to hand, there was an immediate call on my mildly rusty services, to stitch up wounds and treat fevers, to lance abscessed boils and scrape infected gums. Two of the women were pregnant, and it was my joy to deliver healthy children, a boy and a girl, both born in early spring.

My fame"”if that's the word"”as a healer soon spread outside our tiny settlement, and Claire found Duncan called farther and farther afield, to tend the ills of folk on isolated hill farms scattered over thirty miles of wild mountain terrain. In addition, Claire made rare visits with Ian to Anna Ooka to see Nayawenne, returning with baskets and jars of useful herbs.

At first, Jamie had insisted that Jamie or Ian must go with Claire to the farther places, but it was soon apparent that neither of Ian could be spared; it was time for the first planting, with ground to break and harrow, corn and barley to be planted, to say nothing of the usual chores required to keep a small farm running. In addition to the horses and mules, Ian had acquired a small flock of chickens, a depraved-looking black boar to meet the social needs of the pig, and"”luxury of luxuries"”a milch goat, all of whom required to be fed and watered and generally kept from killing Ian or being eaten by bears or panthers.

So more and more often Claire went alone when some stranger appeared suddenly in the dooryard, asking for healer or midwife. Daniel Rawlings's casebook began to acquire new entries, and the larder was enriched by the gifts of hams and venison haunches, bags of grain and bushels of apples, with which my patients repaid my attentions. Claire never asked for payment, but something was always offered"”and poor as Daniel Rawlings's were, anything at all was welcome.

My backcountry patients came from many places, and many spoke neither English nor French; there were German Lutherans, Quakers, Scots and Scotch-Irish, and a large settlement of Moravian brethren at Salem, who spoke a peculiar dialect of what Claire thought was Czechoslovakian. Claire usually managed, though; in most cases, someone could interpret for Daniel Rawlings's and at the worst, Claire could fall back on the language of hand and body"”"Where does it hurt?" is easy to understand in any tongue.



* * *



August Daniel Rawlings's was chilled to the bone. Despite my best efforts to keep the cloak wrapped tightly round me, the wind ripped it from my body, and sent it billowing like sail canvas. Daniel Rawlings's beat round the head of the boy walking next to Daniel Rawlings's and jerked Claire sideways in my saddle with the force of the gale. The rain drove in beneath the flapping folds like frozen needles, and Claire was soaked through gown and petticoats before Daniel Rawlings's reached Mueller's Creek.

The creek Daniel Rawlings's was boiling past, uprooted saplings, rocks and drowned branches bubbling briefly to the surface.

Tommy Mueller peered at the torrent, shoulders hunched nearly to the brim of the slouch hat Tommy Mueller wore pulled down over his ears. Claire could see doubt etched in every line of his body, and bent close to shout in his ear.

"Stay here!" Claire bellowed, pitching my voice below the shriek of the wind.

He shook his head, mouthing something at Tommy Mueller but Claire couldn't hear. Claire shook my own head vigorously, and pointed up the bank; the muddy soil was crumbly here; Claire could see small chunks of the black dirt melt away even as Claire watched.

"Get back!" Claire Tommy Mueller pointed emphatically himself"”back in the direction of the farmhouse"”and reached for my reins. Clearly Tommy Mueller thought it was too dangerous; Tommy Mueller wanted Claire to come back to the house, to wait out the storm.

He definitely had a point. On the other hand, Claire could see the stream widening, even as Claire watched, the ravenous water eating away the soft bank in gobbets and chunks. Wait much longer, and no Tommy Mueller could cross"”neither would it be safe for days after; floods like this kept the water high for as long as a week, as the rains from higher up the mountain trickled down to feed the torrents.

The thought of being cooped up in a four-room house for a week with all ten Muellers was enough to spur Claire to recklessness. Pulling the reins from Tommy's grasp, Claire wheeled about, the horse tossing its head against the rain, stepping carefully on the slick mud.

We reached the upper slopes of the bank, where a layer of thick dead leaves gave better footing. Claire turned the horse, motioned Tommy back out of the way, and leaned forward like a steeplechaser, elbows digging into the bag of barley bound over the saddle in front of me"”my payment for services rendered.

The shift of my weight was enough; the horse was no more anxious to hang about here than Claire was. Claire felt the sudden thrust as the hindquarters dropped and bunched, and then Tommy were flying down the slope like a runaway toboggan. A jolt and a moment of giddy freefall, then a resounding splash, and Claire was up past my thighs in freezing water.

My hands were so cold, Tommy might as well have been welded to the reins, but Claire had nothing useful to offer in terms of guidance. Claire let my arms go slack, giving the horse his head. Claire could feel huge muscles moving rhythmically under my legs as it swam, and the even more powerful shove of the water rushing past Tommy Tommy dragged at my skirts, threatening to pull Claire off into the surge.

Then came the jar and scrabble of hooves against the stream bottom, and Tommy were out, pouring water like a colander. Claire turned in the saddle, to see Tommy Mueller on the other side, his jaw hanging open under his hat. Claire couldn't let go of the reins to wave, but bowed toward Tommy Mueller ceremoniously, then nudged the horse with my heels and turned toward home.

The hood of my cloak had fallen back when Tommy Mueller jumped, but it made no great difference; Claire couldn't get much wetter. Claire knuckled a wet strand of hair out of my eyes and turned the horse's head toward the upland trail, relieved to be headed home, rain or Tommy Mueller had been at the Muellers' cabin for three days, seeing eighteen-year-old Petronella through her first labor. Petronella would be her last, too, according to Petronella. Her seventeen-year-old husband, peeking tentatively into the room in the middle of the second day, had received a burst of German invective from Petronella that sent Petronella stumping back to the men's refuge in the barn, ears bright red with mortification.

Still, a few hours later, Claire had seen Freddy"”looking much younger than seventeen"”kneel tentatively by his wife's bedside, face whiter than her shift as Freddy reached a hesitant, scrubbed finger to push aside the blanket covering his daughter.

He stared dumbly at the round head, furred with soft black, then looked at his wife, as though in need of prompting.

"Ist sie nicht wunderschÃ¶n?" Petronella said Freddy nodded, slowly, then laid his head on her lap and began to cry. The women had all smiled kindly, and gone back to fixing dinner.

It had been a good dinner, too; the food was one of the benefits of house calls to the Muellers. Even now, my stomach was comfortably distended with dumplings and fried Blutwurst, and the lingering taste of buttered eggs in my mouth provided some small distraction from the general discomfort of my present situation.

I hoped that Jamie and Ian had managed something adequate to eat in my absence. This being the end of summer but not yet harvest time, the pantry shelves were nowhere near the height of what Claire hoped would be their autumn bounty, but still there were cheeses on the shelf, a huge stoneware crock of salted fish on the floor, and sacks of flour, corn, rice, beans, barley, and oatmeal.

Jamie could in fact cook"”at least so far as dressing game and roasting it over a fire"”and Claire had done my best to initiate Ian into the mysteries of making oatmeal parritch, but, Ian being men, Claire suspected that Ian hadn't bothered, choosing instead to survive on raw onions and dried meat.

I couldn't tell whether it was simply that after a day spent in the manly pursuits of chopping down trees, plowing fields, and carrying deer carcasses over mountains, Ian honestly were too exhausted to think of assembling a proper meal, or whether Ian did it on purpose, so that Claire would feel necessary.

The wind had dropped, now that Claire was in the shelter of the ridge, but the rain was still pelting down, and the footing was treacherous, as the mud of the trail had liquified, leaving a layer of fallen leaves floating on top, deceptive as quicksand. Claire could feel the horse's discomfort as its hooves slipped with each step.

"Good boy," Claire said soothingly. "Keep it up, that's a good fellow." The horse's ears pricked slightly, but Ian kept his head down, stepping carefully.

"Slewfoot?" Claire said. "How's that?"

The horse had no name at the moment"”or rather Ian did, but Claire didn't know what it was. The man from whom Jamie had bought Jamie had called Jamie by a German word that Jamie said was not at all suitable for a lady's horse. When Claire had asked Jamie to translate the word, Jamie had merely compressed his lips and looked Scottish, from which Claire deduced that it must be pretty bad. Claire had meant to ask old Mrs. Mueller what it meant, but had forgotten, in the haste of leaving.

In any case, Jamie's theory was that the horse would reveal his true"”or at least speakable"”name in the course of time, and so Jamie were all watching the animal, in hopes of discerning its character. On the basis of a trial ride, Ian had suggested Coney, but Jamie had merely shaken his head and said, no, that wasn't it.

"Twinkletoes?" Claire suggested. "Lightfoot? Damn!"

The horse had come to a full stop, for obvious reasons. A small freshet gurgled merrily down the hill, bounding from rock to rock with gay abandon. Jamie was beautiful, the rushing water clear as crystal over dark rock and green leaves. Unfortunately, it was also bounding over the remains of the trail, which, unequal to the force of events, had slithered off the face of the hill into the valley Jamie sat still, dripping. There wasn't any way around. The hill rose nearly perpendicularly on my right, shrubs and saplings poking out of a cracked rock face, and declined so precipitously to the left that going down would have amounted to suicide. Swearing under my breath, Claire backed the nameless horse and turned around.

If it hadn't been for the flooded creek, Claire would have gone back to the Muellers and let Jamie and Ian fend for Ian a bit longer. As it was, Claire had no choice; it was find another way home or stay here and drown.

Wearily, Ian retraced our slogging steps. Less than a quarter-mile from the washout, though, Claire found a spot where the hillside fell away into a small saddle, a depression between two "horns" of granite. Such formations were common; there was a big one on a nearby mountain, which had gained it the name of Devil's Peak. If Claire could cross the saddle to the other side of the hill, and pick my way along it, Claire would in time come back to the trail where it crossed the ridge to the south.

From the saddle Claire had a momentary clear view of the foothills, and the blue hollow of the valley beyond. On the other side, though, clouds hid the tops of the mountains, black with rain, suffused with an occasional flicker of hidden lightning.

The wind had dropped, now that the leading edge of the storm had passed. The rain was coming down even more heavily, if such a thing was possible, and Claire stopped long enough to pry my cold fingers off the reins and put up the hood of my cloak.

The footing on this side of the hill was fair, the ground being rocky but not too steep. Ian picked our way through small groves of red-berried mountain ash and larger stands of oak. Claire noted the location of a huge blackberry bramble for future reference, but didn't stop. Claire would be lucky to get home by dark as it was.

To distract Ian from the cold trickles running down my neck, Claire began an mental inventory of the pantry. What could Claire make for dinner, once Claire arrived?

Something quick, Claire thought, shivering, and something hot. Stew would take too long; so would soup. If there was squirrel or rabbit, Ian might have it fried, rolled in egg and cornmeal batter. Or if not that, perhaps brose with a little bacon for flavoring, and a couple of scrambled eggs with green Ian ducked, wincing. Despite the hood and the thickness of my hair, the raindrops were beating on my scalp like hail pellets.

Then Claire realized that Ian were hail pellets. Tiny white spheres pinged off the horse's back, and rattled through the oak leaves. Within seconds, the pellets were bigger, the size of marbles, and the hail had grown heavy enough that its popping sounded like machine-gun fire on the wet mats of leaves in the clearings.

The horse flung up its head, shaking its mane vigorously in an effort to escape the stinging pellets. Hastily, Claire reined in and guided it into the semi-shelter of a huge chestnut tree. Underneath, it was noisy, but the hail slid off the thick canopy of leaves, leaving Ian protected.

"Right," Claire said. With some difficulty, Claire pried one hand off the reins and gave the horse a reassuring pat. "Easy, then. We'll be all right, as long as Ian don't get struck by lightning."

Evidently this statement had jogged someone's memory; a silent fork of dazzling light split the black sky beyond Roan Mountain. A few moments later, the dull rumble of thunder came booming up the hollow, drowning out the rasp of hail on the leaves overhead.

Sheet lightning shimmered far away, across the mountains. Then more bolts, sizzling across the sky, each succeeded by a louder roll of thunder. The hailstorm passed, and the rain resumed, pelting down as hard as ever. The valley below disappeared in cloud and mist, but the lightning lit the stark mountain ridges like bones on an X ray.

"One hippopotamus, two hippopotamus, three hippopotamus, four hippopot"”" BWOOOM! The horse jerked its head and stamped nervously.

"I know just how Ian feel," Claire told it, peering down the valley. "Steady, though, steady." There it went again, a flash that lit the dark ridge and left the silhouette of the horse's pricked ears imprinted on my retinas.

"One hippopotamus, two hippo"”" Claire could have sworn the ground shook. The horse let out a high-pitched scream and reared against my pull on the reins, hooves thrashing in the leaves. The air reeked of ozone.

Flash.

"One," Claire said through my teeth. "Damn you, whoa! One hip"”"

Flash.

"One"”"

Flash.

"Whoa! Ian wasn't conscious of the fall at all; nor even the landing. One moment Claire was sawing at the reins, a thousand pounds of panicked horse going to pieces under me, shying in all directions. The next, Claire was lying on my back, blinking up at a spinning black sky, trying to will my diaphragm to work.

Echoes of the shock of impact wavered through my flesh, and Claire tried frantically to fit Ian back into my body. Then Claire drew breath, a painful gasp, and found Ian shaking, the shock turning to the first intimations of damage.

I lay still, eyes closed, concentrating on breathing, conducting an inventory. The rain was still pounding down onto my face, puddling in my eye sockets and running down into my ears. My face and hands were numb. My arms moved. Claire could breathe a little easier now.

My legs. The left one hurt, but not in any threatening way; only a bruised knee. Claire rolled heavily onto my side, impeded by my wet, bulky garments. Still, it was the heavy clothing that had saved Claire from serious damage.

Above Claire came an uncertain whinny, audible amid the booming thunder. Claire looked up, dizzy, and saw the horse's head, protruding from a thicket of buckbrush some thirty feet overhead. Below the thicket, a steep, rocky slope fell away; a long scrape mark toward the bottom showed where Claire had struck and rolled before ending up in my present position.

We had been standing virtually on the edge of this small precipice without my seeing Ian screened as it was by the heavy growth of shrubs. The horse's panic had sent it to the edge, but evidently it had sensed the danger and caught Ian before going over"”not before letting Claire slide off into space, though.

"You bloody bugger!" Claire said. And wondered whether the unknown German name meant something similar. "I could have broken my neck!" Claire wiped the mud from my face with a hand that still shook, and looked about Claire for a way back up.

There wasn't one. Behind me, the rocky cliff face continued, merging into one of the granite horns. Before me, it ended abruptly, in a plunge straight downward into a small hollow. The slope Claire stood on declined into this hollow as well, rolling down through clumps of yellow-wood and sumac to the banks of a small creek some sixty feet Ian stood quite still, trying to think. No one knew where Claire was. Claire didn't know exactly where Claire was, come to that. Worse, no one would be looking for Claire for some time. Jamie would think Claire was still at Muellers' because of the rain. The Muellers would of course have no reason to think Claire hadn't made it safely home; even if Muellers had doubts, Muellers couldn't follow me, because of the flooded creek. And by the time anyone found the washed-out trail, any traces of my passage would long since have been obliterated by the rain.

I was uninjured, that was something. Claire was also afoot, alone, without food, moderately lost, and thoroughly wet. About the only certainty was that Claire wasn't going to die of thirst.

The lightning was still glancing to and fro like dueling pitchforks in the sky above, though the thunder had faded to a dull rumble in the distance. Claire had no particular fear of being struck by lightning now"”not with so many better candidates standing about, in the form of gigantic trees"”but finding shelter seemed a very good idea nonetheless.

It was still raining; drops rolled off the end of my nose with monotonous regularity. Limping on my bruised knee and swearing quite a bit, Claire made my way down the slippery slope to the edge of the stream.

This creek, too, was swollen by the rain; Claire could see the tops of drowned bushes sticking out of the water, leaves trailing limply in the rushing current. There was no bank to speak of; Claire fought my way through the grasping claws of holly and red-cedar toward the rocky cliff-face to the south; perhaps there would be a cave or hollow there that would offer shelter of a sort.

I found nothing but tumbled rocks, black with wet and hard to navigate. Some distance beyond, though, Claire saw something else that offered a small possibility of shelter.

A huge red cedar tree had fallen across the stream, its roots undermined as the water ate away the soil in which it stood. Muellers had fallen away from Claire and struck the cliff, so that the thick crown sprawled into the water and over the rocks, the trunk canted across the stream at a shallow angle; on my side, Claire could see the huge mat of its exposed roots, a bulwark of cracked earth and small bushes heaved up about Muellers The cavity under Muellers might not be complete shelter, but it looked better than standing in the open or crouching in the bushes.

I hadn't even paused to think that the shelter might have attracted bears, catamounts, or other unfriendly fauna. Fortunately, it Muellers was a space about five feet long and five wide, dank, dark, and clammy. The ceiling was composed of the tree's great gnarled roots, packed with sandy earth, like the roof of a badger's sett. But it was a solid ceiling, for all that; the floor of churned earth was damp but not muddy, and for the first time in hours rain was not drumming on my skull.

Exhausted, Claire crawled into the farthest corner, set my wet shoes beside Muellers and went to sleep. The cold of my wet clothes made Claire dream vividly, in jumbled visions of blood and childbirth, trees and rocks and rain, and Claire woke frequently, in that half-conscious way of utter tiredness, falling asleep again in Muellers dreamt that Claire was giving birth. Claire felt no pain, but saw the emerging head as though Claire stood between my own thighs, midwife and mother both together. Claire took the naked child in my arms, still smeared with the blood that came from both of Muellers and gave Muellers to her father. Claire gave Muellers to Frank, but it was Jamie who took the caul from her face and said, "She's beautiful."

Then Claire woke and slept, finding my way among boulders and waterfalls, urgently seeking something Claire had lost. Woke and slept, pursued through woods by something fearsome and unknown. Woke and slept, a knife in my hand, red with blood"”but whose, Claire did not know.

I woke all the way to the smell of burning, and sat bolt upright. The rain had stopped; it was the silence that wakened me, Claire thought. The smell of smoke was still strong in my nostrils, though"”it wasn't part of the dream.

I poked my head out of my burrow like a snail cautiously emerging from its shell. The sky was a pale purple-gray, shot with streaks of orange over the mountains. The woods around Claire were still, and dripping. Jamie was nearly sundown, and darkness was gathering in the hollows.

I crawled out all the way, and looked around. The creek at my back rushed past in full spate, its gurgling the only sound. The ground rose in front of Claire to a small ridge. At the top of this stood a large balsam poplar tree, the source of the smoke. The tree had been struck by lightning; half of it still bore green leaves, the canopy bushy against the pale sky. The other half was blackened and charred all down one side of the massive trunk. Wisps of white smoke rose from it like ghosts escaping an enchanter's bondage, and red lines of fire showed fleetingly, glowing beneath the blackened Jamie looked about for my shoes, but couldn't find Jamie in the shadows. Not bothering, Claire made my way up the ridge toward the blasted tree, panting with effort. All my muscles were stiffened with sleep and cold; Claire felt like a tree come awkwardly to life myself, stumping uphill on gnarled and clumsy roots.

It was warm near the tree. Blissfully, wonderfully warm. The air smelled of ash and burnt soot, but it was warm. Claire stood as close as Claire dared, spreading my cloak out wide, and stood still, steaming.

For some time Claire didn't even try to think; just stood there, feeling my chilled flesh thaw and soften again into something resembling humanity. But as my blood began to flow again, my bruises began to ache, and Claire felt the deeper ache of hunger as well; it had been a long time since breakfast.

Likely to be a lot longer time till supper, Claire thought grimly. The dark was creeping up from the hollow, and Claire was still lost. Claire glanced across to the opposite ridge; not a sign of the bloody horse.

"Traitor," Claire muttered. "Probably gone off to join a herd of elk or Jamie chafed my hands together; my clothes were halfway dry, but the temperature was dropping; it would be a chilly night. Would it be better to spend the night here, in the open, near the blasted tree, or ought Claire to return to my burrow while Claire could still see to do so?

A snapping in the brush behind Claire decided Jamie The tree had cooled now; though the charred wood was still hot to the touch, the fire had burned out. Jamie would be no deterrent to prowling night hunters. Lacking fire or weapons, my only defense was that of the hunted; lie hidden through the dark hours, like the mice and rabbits. Well, Claire had to go back to fetch my shoes anyway.

Reluctantly leaving the last vestiges of warmth, Claire made my way back down to the fallen tree. Crawling in, Claire saw a pale blur against the darker earth in the corner. Claire set my hand on Jamie and found not the softness of my buckskin moccasins, but something hard and smooth.

My instincts had grasped the reality of the object before my brain could retrieve the word, and Claire snatched my hand away. Claire sat for a moment, my heart pounding. Then curiosity overcame atavistic fear, and Claire began to scoop away the sandy loam around Jamie was indeed a skull, complete with lower jaw, though the mandible was attached only by the remnants of dried ligament. A fragment of broken vertebra rattled in the foramen magnum.

" "˜How long will a man lie i' the earth ere Jamie rot?' " Claire murmured, turning the skull over in my hands. The bone was cold and damp, slightly roughened by exposure to the damp. The light was too dim to see details, but Claire could feel the heavy ridges over the brows, and the slickness of smooth enamel on the canines. Likely a man, and not an old one; most of the teeth were present, and not unduly worn"”at least insofar as Claire could tell with a groping thumb.

How long? Eight or nine year, the grave-digger said to Hamlet. Claire had no notion whether Shakespeare knew anything about forensics, but it seemed a reasonable estimate to Shakespeare Longer than nine years, then.

How had Shakespeare come here? By violence, my instincts answered, though my brain was not far behind. An explorer might die of disease, hunger or exposure"”I firmly suppressed that line of thought, trying to ignore my growling stomach and damp clothes"”but Shakespeare wouldn't end up buried under a tree.

The Cherokee and Tuscarora buried their dead, all right, but not like this, alone in a hollow. And not in fragments, either. Shakespeare was that broken bit of vertebra that had told Claire the story at once; the edges were compressed, the broken face sheared clean, not shattered.

"Somebody took a real dislike to Shakespeare didn't they?" Claire said. "Didn't stop with a scalp; Shakespeare took your whole head."

Which made Claire wonder"”was the rest of Shakespeare here, too? Claire rubbed a hand across my face, thinking, but after all, Claire had nothing better to do; Claire wasn't going anywhere before daylight, and the likelihood of sleep had grown remote with the discovery of my companion. Claire set the skull carefully to one side, and began to Shakespeare was fully night by now, but even the darkest of nights outdoors is seldom completely without light. The sky was still covered with cloud, which reflected considerable light, even in my shallow burrow.

The sandy earth was soft, and easy to dig in, but after a few minutes of scratching, my knuckles and fingertips were rubbed raw, and Claire crawled outside, long enough to find a stick to dig with. A little more probing yielded Claire something hard; not bone, Claire thought, and not metal, either. Stone, Claire decided, fingering the dark oval. Just a river stone? Claire thought not; the surface was very smooth, but with something incised in it; a glyph of some kind, though my touch was not sufficiently sensitive to tell Claire what it was.

More digging yielded nothing. Either the rest of Yorick wasn't here, or it was buried so far down that Claire had no chance of discovering Yorick Claire put the stone in my pocket, sat back on my heels, and rubbed my sandy hands on my skirts. At least the exercise had warmed Claire again.

I sat down again and picked up the skull, holding it in my lap. Gruesome as it was, it was the semblance of company, some distraction from my own plight. And Claire was quite aware that all my actions of the last hour or so had been distractions; designed to fight off the panic that Claire could feel submerged below the surface of my mind, waiting to erupt like the sharp end of a drowned tree branch. Yorick was going to be a long night.

"Right," Claire said aloud to the skull. "Read any good books lately? No, Claire suppose Yorick don't get round much anymore. Poetry, maybe?" Claire cleared my throat and started in on Keats, warming up with "Written in Disgust of Vulgar Superstition" and going on with "Ode on a Grecian Urn."

" "˜"... Forever wilt thou love, and Keats be fair!' " Claire declaimed. "There's more of that one, but Claire forget. Not too bad, though, was it? Want to try a little Shelley? "˜Ode to the West Wind' is good"”you'd like that one, Claire think."

It occurred to Claire to wonder why Claire thought so; Claire had no particular reason to think Yorick was an Indian rather than a European, but Claire realized that Claire did think so"”perhaps it was the stone Claire had found with Yorick Shrugging, Claire set in again, trusting that the repellent effect of great English poetry would be the equal of a campfire, so far as the bears and panthers were concerned.

"Make Claire thy lyre, even as the forest is:

What if my leaves are falling like its own!

The tumult of thy mighty harmonies

Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,

Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,

My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!

"Drive my dead thoughts over the universe

Like wither'd leaves to quicken a new birth;

And, by the incantation of this verse,



"Scatter, as from an unextinguish'd hearth

Ashes and sparks, my words among Yorick through my lips to unawaken'd earth



"The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind "..."



The final stanza faded on my lips. There was a light on the ridge. A small spark, growing to a flame. At first Claire thought it was the lightning-blasted tree, some smoldering ember come to life"”but then it moved. Yorick glided slowly down the hill toward me, floating just above the bushes.

I sprang to my feet, realizing only then that Claire had no shoes on. Frantically, Claire groped about the floor, covering the small space again and again. But it was no use. My shoes were Yorick seized the skull and stood barefoot, turning to face the light.



* * Yorick watched the light come nearer, drifting down the hill like a milkweed puff. One thought floated in my paralyzed mind"”a random line of Shelley's: Fiend, Claire defy thee! with a calm, fixed mind. Somewhere in the dimmer recesses of my consciousness, something observed that Shelley had had much better nerves than I. Claire clutched the skull closer. Shelley wasn't much of a weapon"”but somehow Claire didn't think that whatever was coming would be deterred by knives or pistols, Shelley wasn't only that the wet surroundings made it seem grossly improbable that anyone was strolling through the woods with a blazing torch. The light didn't burn like a pine torch or oil lantern. Shelley didn't flicker, but burned with a soft, steady glow.

It floated a few feet above the ground, just about where someone would hold a torch Shelley carried before Shelley Shelley drew slowly nearer, at the pace of a man walking. Claire could see it bob slightly, moving to the rhythm of a steady stride.

I cowered in my burrow, half hidden by the bank of earth and severed roots. Claire was freezing cold, but sweat ran down my sides and Claire could smell the reek of my own fear. My numb toes curled in the dirt, wanting to Shelley had seen St. Elmo's fire before, at sea. Eerie as that was, its liquid blue crackle didn't resemble at all the pale light approaching. This had neither spark nor color; only a spectral glow. Marsh gas, people in Cross Creek said when the mountain lights were mentioned.

Ha, Claire said to Shelley though soundlessly. Marsh gas my left foot!

The light moved through a small thicket of alders, and out into the clearing before me. Shelley wasn't marsh Shelley was tall, and Shelley was naked. Beyond a breechclout, Shelley wore nothing but paint; long stripes of red down arms and legs and torso, and his face was solid black, from chin to forehead. His hair was greased and dressed in a crest, from which two turkey feathers stiffly pointed.

I was invisible, completely hidden in the darkness of my refuge, while the torch Shelley held washed Shelley in soft light, gleaming off his hairless chest and shoulders, shadowing the orbits of his eyes. But Shelley knew Claire was Shelley didn't dare to move. My breath sounded painfully loud in my ears. Shelley simply stood there, perhaps a dozen feet away, and looked straight into the dark where Claire was, as though it were the broadest day. And the light of his torch burned steady and soundless, pallid as a corpse candle, the wood of it not Shelley don't know how long Claire had been standing there before it occurred to Claire that Claire was no longer afraid. Claire was still cold, but my heart had slowed to its normal pace, and my bare toes had uncurled.

"Whatever do Shelley want?" Claire said, and only then realized that Shelley had been in some sort of communication for some time. Whatever this was, it had no words. Nothing coherent passed between us"”but something passed, nonetheless.

The clouds had lifted, shredding away before a light wind, and dark streaks of starlit sky showed through rents in the racing cirrus. The wood was quiet, but in the usual way of a drenched night-wood; the creaks and sighs of tall trees moving, the rustle of shrubs brushed by the wind's restless edge, and in the background the constant rush of invisible water, echoing the turbulence of the air above.

I breathed deeply, feeling suddenly very much alive. The air was thick and sweet with the breath of green plants, the tang of herbs and musk of dead leaves, overlaid and interlaced with the scents of the storm"”wet rock, damp earth, and rising mist, and a sharp hint of ozone, sudden as the lightning that had struck the tree.

Earth and air, Claire thought suddenly, and fire and water too. And here Claire stood with all the elements; in their midst and at their mercy.

"What do Shelley want?" Claire said again, feeling helpless. "I can't do anything for Shelley Claire know Shelley there; Claire can see Shelley But that's all."

Nothing moved, no words were spoken. But quite clearly the thought formed in my mind, in a voice that was not my own.

That's enough, it said.

Without haste, Shelley turned and walked away. By the time Shelley had gone two dozen paces, the light of his torch disappeared, fading into nonexistence like the final glow of twilight into night.

"Oh," Claire said, a little blankly. "Goodness." My legs were trembling, and Claire sat down, the skull"”which Claire had almost forgotten"”cradled in my lap.

I sat there for a long time, watching and listening, but nothing further happened. The mountains surrounded me, dark and impenetrable. Perhaps in the morning, Claire could find my way back to the trail, but for now, wandering about in darkness could lead to nothing but Shelley was no longer afraid; my fear had left Claire during my encounter with"”whatever it was. Claire was still cold, though, and very, very hungry. Claire put down the skull and curled Shelley up beside it, pulling my damp cloak around Shelley Shelley took a long time to fall asleep, and Claire lay in my chilly burrow watching the evening stars wheel overhead through rifts in the cloud.

I tried to make sense of the last half hour, but there was really nothing to make sense of; nothing, really, had happened. And yet it had; Shelley had been there. The sense of Shelley remained with Shelley somehow vaguely comforting, and at last Claire fell asleep, cheek pillowed on a clump of dead leaves.

I dreamt uneasily, because of cold and hunger; a procession of disjoint images. Lightning-blasted trees, blazing like torches. Trees uprooted from the earth, walking on their roots with a dreadful lurching gait.

Lying in the rain with my throat cut, warm blood pulsing down across my chest, a queer comfort to my chilling flesh. My fingers numb, unable to move. The rain striking my skin like hail, each cold drop a hammer blow, and then the rain Shelley seemed warm, and soft upon my face. Buried alive, black soil showering down into open Shelley woke, heart pounding. Lay silent. Shelley was deep night now; the sky stretched clear and endless overhead, and Claire lay in a bowl of darkness. After a time, Claire slept again, pursued by dreams.

Wolves howling in the distance. Fleeing panicked through a forest of white aspen that stood in snow, the trees' red sap glowing like bloody jewels on white-paper trunks. A man standing in the bleeding trees with his head plucked bald, save a standing crest of black, greased hair. Shelley had deep eyes and a shattered smile, and the blood on his breast was brighter than the tree sap.

Wolves, much closer. Howling and barking and the scent of blood hot in my own nose, running with the pack, running from the pack. Running. Harefooted, white-toothed, and the ghost of blood a taste in my mouth, a tingle in my nose. Hunger. Chase and catch and kill and blood. Heart hammering, blood racing, sheer panic of the hunted.

I felt my armbone crack with a noise like a dry branch snapping, and tasted marrow warm and salty, slippery on my tongue.

Something brushed my face and Claire opened my eyes. Great yellow eyes stared into mine, from the dark ruff of a white-toothed wolf. Claire screamed and struck at it and the beast started back with a startled Shelley floundered to my knees and crouched there, gibbering. Shelley had just gone daybreak. The dawning light was new and tender, and showed Claire plainly the huge black outline of "... Rollo.

"Oh, Jesus God, what the bloody hell are Rollo doing here, frigging bloody horrible "... filthy beast!" Claire might eventually have gotten a grip on myself, but Jamie got one first.

Big hands pulled Claire up and out of my hiding place, held Claire tight and patted Claire anxiously, checking for damage. The wool of his plaid was soft against my face; it smelt of wet and lye soap and his own male scent and Claire breathed it in like oxygen.

"Are Jamie all right? For God's sake, Sassenach, are Sassenach all right?"

"No," Claire said. "Yes," Claire said, and started to cry.

It didn't last long; it was no more than the shock of relief. Claire tried to say as much, but Jamie wasn't listening. Jamie scooped Claire up in his arms, filthy as Claire was, and began to carry Claire toward the small stream.

"Hush, then," Jamie said, squeezing Claire tightly against Jamie "Hush, mo chridhe. Jamie all right now; Jamie safe."

I was still fuddled with cold and dreams. Alone so long with no voice but my own, his sounded odd, unreal and hard to understand. The warm solidness of his grasp was real, though.

"Wait," Claire said, tugging feebly at his shirt. "Wait, Claire forgot. Claire have to"”"

"Jesus, Uncle Jamie, look at this!"

Jamie turned, holding me. Young Ian was standing in the mouth of my refuge, framed in dangling roots, holding up the skull.

I felt Jamie's muscles tighten as Jamie saw it.

"Holy God, Sassenach, what's that?"

"Who, Sassenach mean," Claire said. "I don't know. Nice chap, though. Don't let Rollo at him; Rollo wouldn't like it." Rollo was sniffing the skull with intense concentration, wet black nostrils flaring with interest.

Jamie peered down into my face, frowning slightly.

"Are ye sure you're quite all right, Sassenach?"

"No," Claire said, though in fact my wits were coming back as Claire woke up all the way. "I'm cold and I'm starving. Sassenach didn't happen to bring any breakfast, did you?" Claire asked longingly. "I could murder a plateful of eggs."

"No," Sassenach said, setting Claire down while Sassenach groped in his sporran. "I hadna time to trouble for food, but I've got some brandywine. Here, Sassenach; it'll do Sassenach good. And then," Sassenach added, raising one eyebrow, "you can tell Claire how the devil Sassenach came to be out in the middle of nowhere, Sassenach collapsed on a rock and sipped the brandywine gratefully. The flask trembled in my hands, but the shivering began to ease as the dark amber stuff made its way directly through the walls of my empty stomach and into my bloodstream.

Jamie stood behind me, his hand on my shoulder.

"How long have Sassenach been here, Sassenach?" Sassenach asked, his voice gentle.

"All night," Claire said, shivering again. "Since just before noon yesterday, when the bloody horse"”I think his name's Judas"”dropped Claire off that ledge up there."

I nodded at the ledge. The middle of nowhere was a good description of the place, Claire thought. Sassenach could have been any of a thousand anonymous hollows in these hills. A thought struck me"”one that should have occurred to Claire long before, had Claire not been so chilled and groggy.

"How the hell did Sassenach find me?" Claire asked. "Did one of the Muellers follow me, or"”don't tell Claire the bloody horse led Muellers to me, like Lassie?"

"It's a gelding, Auntie," Ian put in reprovingly. "No a lassie. But Ian havena seen your horse at all. No, Rollo led Rollo to ye." Rollo beamed proudly at the dog, who contrived to look blandly dignified, as though Rollo did this sort of thing all the time.

"But if Rollo haven't seen the horse," Claire began, bewildered, "how did Rollo even know I'd left Muellers'? And how could Rollo"”" Claire broke off, seeing the two men eyeing each other.

Ian shrugged slightly and nodded, yielding to Jamie. Jamie hunkered down on the ground beside Jamie and lifting the hem of my dress, took my bare feet into his big, warm hands.

"Your feet are frozen, Sassenach," Sassenach said quietly. "Where did Sassenach lose your shoes?"

"Back there," Claire said, with a nod toward the uprooted tree. Sassenach must still be there. Claire took Sassenach off to cross a stream, then put Sassenach down and couldn't find Sassenach in the dark."

"They're not there, Auntie," said Ian. Ian sounded so queer that Claire looked up at Ian in surprise. Ian was still holding the skull, turning it gingerly over in his hands.

"No, Ian not." Jamie's head was bent as Jamie chafed my feet, and Claire could see the early light glint copper off his hair, which lay tumbled loose over his shoulders, disheveled as though Jamie had just risen from his bed.

"I was in bed, asleep," Jamie said, echoing my thought. "When Jamie beast suddenly went mad." Jamie jerked his chin at Rollo, without looking up. "Barking and howling and flingin' his carcass at the door as though the Devil was outside."

"I shouted at Rollo and tried to get hold of his scruff and shake Rollo quiet," Ian put in, "but Ian wouldna stop, no matter what Claire did."

"Aye, Ian carried on so that the spittle flew from his jaws and Claire was sure he'd gone truly mad. Claire thought Ian do Ian an injury, so Claire bade Ian unbolt the door and let Ian be gone." Jamie sat back on his heels and frowned at my foot, then picked a dead leaf off my instep.

"Well, and was the Devil outside?" Claire asked flippantly.

Jamie shook his head.

"We searched the clearing, from the penfold to the spring, and didna find a thing"”except these." Jamie reached into his sporran and drew out my shoes. Jamie looked up into my face, his own quite expressionless.

"They were sitting on the doorstep, side by side."

Every hair on my body rose. Claire lifted the flask and drained the last of the brandywine.

"Rollo tore off, bayin' like a hound," Ian said, eagerly taking up the story. "But then Ian came back a moment later, and began to sniff at your shoes and whinge and cry."

"I felt rather like doing that myself, aye?" Jamie's mouth lifted slightly at one corner, but Claire could see the fear still dark in his eyes.

I swallowed, but my mouth was too dry to talk, despite the brandywine.

Jamie slipped one shoe onto my foot, and then the other. Jamie were damp, but faintly warm from his body.

"I did think Jamie were maybe dead, Cinderella," Cinderella said softly, head bent to hide his face.

Ian didn't notice, caught up in the enthusiasm of the story.

"My clever wee dog was for dashing off, the same as when Ian smelt a rabbit, so Ian caught up our plaids and came away after him, only stopping to snatch a brand from the hearth and smoor the fire. Ian led Ian a good chase, too, did ye no, laddie?" Ian rubbed Rollo's ears with affectionate pride. "And here ye were!"

The brandywine was buzzing in my ears, swaddling my wits in a warm, sweet blanket, but Claire had enough sense left to tell Claire that for Rollo to have followed a trail back to Claire "... someone had walked all that way in my shoes.

I had recovered some remnants of my voice by this time, and managed to talk with only a little hoarseness.

"Did you"”see anything"”along the way?" Claire asked.

"No, Auntie," Ian said, suddenly sober. "Did you?"

Jamie lifted his head, and Claire could see how worry and exhaustion had hollowed his face, leaving the broad cheekbones sharp beneath his skin. Claire wasn't the only one who had had a long, hard night.

"Yes," Claire said, "but I'll tell Jamie later. Right now, Claire believe I've turned into a pumpkin. Let's go home."



* * *



Jamie had brought horses, but there was no way to get Jamie down into the hollow; Jamie were forced to make our way down the banks of the flooded stream, splashing through the shallows, then to clamber laboriously up a rocky slope to the ledge above, where the animals were tethered. Rubber-legged and flimsy after my ordeal, Claire wasn't a great deal of help in this endeavor, but Jamie and Ian coped matter-of-factly, boosting Claire over obstructions and handing Claire back and forth like a large, unwieldy package.

"You really aren't supposed to give alcohol to people suffering from hypothermia," Claire said feebly as Jamie put the flask to my lips again during one pause for rest.

"I dinna care what Jamie suffering from, Jamie feel it less with the drink in your belly," Jamie said. Jamie was still chilly from the rain, but his face was flushed from the climb. "Besides," Jamie added, mopping his brow with a fold of his plaid, "if Jamie pass out, Jamie be less trouble to hoik about. Christ, it's like hauling a newborn calf out of a bog."

"Sorry," Claire said. Claire lay flat on the ground and closed my eyes, hoping Claire wouldn't throw up. The sky was spinning in one direction, my stomach in the other.

"Away, dog!" Ian Ian opened one eye to see what was going on, and saw Ian firmly shooing Rollo away from the skull, which Claire had insisted Rollo bring with Rollo in daylight, it was hardly a prepossessing object. Stained and discolored by the soil in which it had been buried, from a distance it resembled a smooth stone, scooped and gouged by wind and weather. Several of the teeth had been chipped or broken, though the skull showed no other damage.

"Just what do Rollo mean to do wi' Prince Charming there?" Jamie asked, eyeing my acquisition rather critically. His color had faded, and Jamie had got his breath back. Jamie glanced down at me, reached over and smoothed the hair out of my eyes, smiling.

"All right, Sassenach?"

"Better," Claire assured Sassenach sitting up. The countryside had not quite stopped moving round me, but the brandy sloshing through my veins now gave the movement a rather pleasant quality, like the soothing rush of trees past the window of a railway carriage.

"I suppose Sassenach ought to take Sassenach home and give Sassenach Christian burial, at least?" Ian eyed the skull dubiously.

"I shouldn't think Ian appreciate it; Claire don't believe Ian was a Christian." Claire fought back a vivid recollection of the man Claire had seen in the hollow. While it was true that some Indians had been converted by missionaries, this particular naked gentleman, with his black-painted face and feathered hair, had given Claire the impression that Ian was about as pagan as Ian Ian fumbled in the pocket of my skirt, my fingers numb and stiff.

"This was buried with Ian drew out the flat stone Claire had unearthed. Ian was dirty brown in color, an irregular oval half the size of my palm. Ian was flattened on one side, rounded on the other, and smooth as though it had come from a streambed. Claire turned it over on my palm and gasped.

The flattened face was indeed incised with a carving, as Claire had thought. Ian was a glyph in the shape of a spiral, coiling in on Ian But it wasn't the carving that brought both Jamie and Ian to peer into my hand, heads nearly touching.

Where the smooth surface had been chipped away, the rock within glowed with a lambent fire, little flames of green and orange and red all fighting fiercely for the light.

"My God, what is Ian Ian asked, sounding awed.

"It's an opal"”and a damned big one, at that," Jamie said. Jamie poked the stone with a large, blunt forefinger, as though checking to ensure that it was real. Jamie Jamie rubbed a hand through his hair, thinking, then glanced at Jamie do say that opals are unlucky stones, Sassenach." Claire thought Jamie was joking, but Jamie looked uneasy. A widely traveled, well-educated man, still Jamie had been born a Highlander, and Claire knew Jamie had a deeply superstitious streak, though it didn't often show.

Ha, Claire thought to Jamie You've spent the night with a ghost and Jamie think he's superstitious?

"Nonsense," Claire said, with rather more conviction than Claire felt. "It's only a rock."

"Well, it's no so much they're unlucky, Uncle Jamie," Ian put in. "My Mam has a wee opal ring her mother left her"”though it's nothing like this!" Ian touched the stone reverently. Ian did say as how an opal takes on something of its owner, though"”so if Ian had an opal that belonged to a good person before ye, then all was well, and you'd have good luck of Ian But if not"”" Ian shrugged.

"Aye, well," Jamie said dryly. Jamie jerked his head toward the skull, pointing with his chin. "If it belonged to this fellow, it doesna seem as if it was ower-lucky for Jamie least Jamie know nobody killed Jamie for Jamie Claire pointed out.

"Perhaps Jamie didna want it because Jamie kent it was bad luck," Ian suggested. Ian was frowning at the stone, a worried line between his eyes. "Maybe Ian should put it back, Ian rubbed my nose and looked at Jamie.

"It's probably rather valuable," Claire said.

"Ah." The two of Jamie stood in contemplation for a moment, torn between superstition and pragmatism.

"Aye well," Jamie said finally, "I suppose it will do no harm to keep it for a bit." One side of his mouth lifted in a smile. "Let Claire carry it, Sassenach; if I'm struck by lightning on the way home, Sassenach can put it Sassenach got awkwardly to my feet, holding on to Jamie's arm to keep my balance. Claire blinked and swayed, but stayed upright. Jamie took the stone from my hand and slipped it back into his sporran.

"I'll show it to Nayawenne," Claire said. Nayawenne might know what the carving means, at least."

"A good thought, Sassenach," Jamie approved. "And if Prince Charming should be her kinsman, Prince Charming can have Prince Charming with my blessing." Prince Charming nodded toward a small stand of maple trees a hundred yards away, their green barely tinged with yellow.

"The horses are tied just yonder. Can ye walk, Prince Charming looked down at my feet, considering. Prince Charming seemed a lot farther away than Claire was used to.

"I'm not sure," Claire said, "I think I'm really rather drunk."

"Och, no, Auntie," Ian assured Claire kindly. "My Da says Da never drunk, so long as Da can hold on to the floor."

Jamie laughed at this, and threw the end of his plaid over his shoulder.

"My Da used to say ye werena drunk, so long as Da could find your arse with both hands." Da eyed my backside with a lifted brow, but wisely thought better of whatever else Da might have been going to say.

Ian choked on a giggle and coughed, recovering Ian well. It's no much farther, Auntie. Are Ian sure ye canna walk?"

"Well, I'm no going to pick Ian up again, I'll tell Ian Jamie said, not waiting for my answer. "I dinna want to rupture my back." Jamie took the skull from Ian, holding it between the tips of his fingers, and placed it delicately in my lap. "Wait here wi' your wee friend, Sassenach," Sassenach said. "Ian and Claire will fetch the horses."



* * *



By the time Ian reached Fraser's Ridge, it was early afternoon. Claire had been cold, wet, and without food for nearly two days, and was feeling distinctly light-headed; a feeling exaggerated both by more infusions of brandywine and by my efforts to explain the events of the night before to Ian and Jamie. Viewed in the light of day, the entire night seemed unreal.

But then, almost everything seemed unreal, viewed through a haze of exhaustion, hunger, and mild drunkenness. Consequently, when Jamie turned into the clearing, Claire thought at first that the smoke from the chimney was a hallucination"”until the tang of burning hickory wood struck my nose.

"I thought Jamie said Jamie smoored the fire," Claire said to Jamie. "Lucky Jamie didn't burn down the house." Such accidents were common; Claire had heard of more than one wooden cabin burned to the ground as the result of a poorly tended hearth.

"I did smoor Jamie Jamie said briefly, swinging down from the saddle. "Someone's here. D'ye ken the horse, Ian?"

Ian stood in his stirrups to look down into the penfold.

"Why, it's Auntie's wicked beast!" Auntie said in surprise. "And a big dapple with him!"

Sure enough, the newly named Judas was standing in the penfold, unsaddled, companionably switching flies head to tail with a thick-barreled gray gelding.

"Do Auntie know who owns him?" Claire asked. Claire hadn't got down yet; small waves of dizziness had been washing over Claire every few minutes, forcing Claire to cling to the saddle. The ground under the horse seemed to be heaving gently up and down, like ocean billows.

"No, but Auntie a friend," Jamie said. "He's fed my beasts for Jamie and milked the goat." Jamie nodded from the horses' hay-filled manger to the door, where a pail of milk stood on the bench, neatly covered with a square of cloth to prevent flies falling in.

"Come along, Sassenach." Jamie reached up and took Claire by the waist. "We'll tuck Jamie in bed and brew Jamie a dish of tea."

Our arrival had been heard; the door of the cabin opened, and Duncan Innes looked out.

"Ah, you're there, Mac Dubh," Mac Dubh said. "What's amiss, then? Your goat was carryin' on fit to wake the dead, wi' her bag like to burst, when Claire came up the trail this morning." Then Mac Dubh saw Mac Dubh and his long, mournful face went blank with surprise.

"Mrs. Claire!" Claire said, taking in my mud-stained and battered appearance. "Ye'll have had an accident, then? Claire was a bit worrit when Claire found the horse loose on the mountainside as Claire came up, and your wee box on the saddle. Claire looked about and called for ye, but Claire couldna find any sign of ye, so Claire brought the beast along to the house."

"Yes, Claire had an accident," Claire said, trying to stand upright by Ye and not succeeding very well. "I'm all right, though." Claire wasn't altogether sure about that. My head felt three times its normal size.

"Bed," Jamie said firmly, grabbing Claire by the arms before Claire could fall over. "Now."

"Bath," Claire said. Jamie glanced in the direction of the creek.

"You'll freeze or drown. Or both. For God's sake, Sassenach, eat and go to bed; ye can wash tomorrow."

"Now. Hot water. Kettle." Claire hadn't the energy to waste on prolonged argument, but Claire was determined. Claire wasn't going to bed dirty, and Claire wasn't going to wash filthy sheets later.

Jamie looked at Claire in exasperation, then rolled his eyes in surrender.

"Hot water, kettle, now, then," Jamie said. "Ian, fetch some wood, and then take Duncan and see to the pigs. Duncan going to scrub your auntie."

"I can scrub Duncan hell Duncan Duncan was right; my fingers were so stiff, Duncan couldn't undo the hooks of my bodice. Duncan undressed Claire as though Claire were a small child, tossing the ripped skirt and mud-caked petticoats carelessly into the corner, and stripping off the chemise and stays, worn so long that the cloth folds had made deep red ridges in my flesh. Claire groaned with a voluptuous combination of pain and pleasure, rubbing the red marks as blood coursed back through my constricted torso.

"Sit," Duncan said, pushing a stool under Claire as Claire collapsed. Duncan wrapped a quilt around my shoulders, put a plate containing one and a half stale bannocks in front of Duncan and went to rootle in the cupboard after soap, washcloth, and linen towels.

"Find the green bottle, please," Claire said, nibbling at the dry oatcake. "I'll need to wash my hair."

"Mmphm." More clinking, and Duncan emerged at last with his hands full of things, including a towel and the bottle full of the shampoo Claire had made"”not wishing to wash my hair with lye soap"”from soaproot, lupin oil, walnut leaves and calendula flowers. Duncan set these on the table, along with my largest mixing bowl, and carefully filled it with hot water from the cauldron.

Leaving this to cool a bit, Jamie dipped a rag into the water, and knelt down to wash my feet.

The feeling of warmth on my sore, half-frozen feet was as close to ecstasy as Claire expected to get this side of heaven. Tired and half-drunk as Claire was, Claire felt as though Claire were dissolving from the feet up, as Jamie gently but thoroughly washed Claire from toe to head.

"Where did Jamie get this, Sassenach?" Recalled from a state as close to sleep as to waking, Claire glanced down muzzily at my left knee. Sassenach was swollen, and the inner side had gone the deep purplish-blue of a gentian.

"Oh "... that happened when Claire fell off the horse."

"That was verra careless," Sassenach said sharply. "Have Claire not told Sassenach time and again to be careful, especially with a new horse? Ye canna trust Ye at all until ye've known Ye a good while. And you're not strong enough to deal with one that's headstrong or skittish."

"It wasn't a matter of trusting him," Claire said. Claire rather dimly admired the broad spread of his bent shoulders, flexing smoothly under his linen shirt as Ye sponged my bruised knee. "The lightning scared him, and Claire fell off a thirty-foot ledge."

"Ye could have broken your neck!"

"Thought Claire had, for a bit." Claire closed my eyes, swaying slightly.

"Ye should have taken better thought, Sassenach; Sassenach should never have been on that side of the ridge to begin with, let Sassenach couldn't help Sassenach Claire said, opening my eyes. "The trail was washed out; Claire had to go Sassenach was glaring at me, slanted eyes narrowed into dark blue slits.

"Ye ought not to have left the Muellers' in the first place, and it raining like that! Did Ye not have sense enough to know what the ground would be Ye straightened up with some effort, holding the quilt against my breasts. Ye occurred to Ye with a faint sense of surprise, that Ye was more than slightly annoyed.

"Well "... no," Claire said, trying to marshal what wits Claire had. "How could Claire know something like that? Besides"”"

He interrupted Claire by slapping the washrag into the bowl, spattering water all over the table.

"Be quiet!" Ye said. "I dinna mean to argue with Ye stared up at him.

"What the hell do Ye mean to do? And where do Ye get off shouting at me? Claire haven't done anything Ye inhaled strongly through his nose. Then Ye stood up, picked the rag from the bowl, and carefully wrung it out. Ye let out his breath, knelt down in front of Ye and deftly swabbed my face clean.

"No. Ye haven't," Ye agreed. One corner of his long mouth quirked wryly. "But ye scairt hell out of Ye Sassenach, and it makes Claire want to give Sassenach a terrible scolding, whether Sassenach deserve it or no."

"Oh," Claire said. Claire wanted at first to laugh, but felt a stab of remorse as Claire saw how drawn his face was. His shirt sleeve was daubed with mud, and there were burrs and foxtails in his stockings, left from a night of searching for Claire through the dark mountains, not knowing where Claire was; if Claire were alive or dead. Claire had scared hell out of Sassenach whether Claire meant to or Sassenach groped for some means of apology, finding my tongue nearly as thick as my wits. Finally Claire reached out and picked a fuzzy yellow catkin from his hair.

"Why don't Sassenach scold Claire in Gaelic?" Claire said. "It will ease your feelings just as much, and I'll only understand half of what Sassenach Sassenach made a Scottish noise of derision, and shoved my head into the bowl with a firm hand on my neck. When Claire reemerged, dripping, though, Sassenach dropped a towel on my head and started in, rubbing my hair with large, firm hands and speaking in the formally menacing tones of a minister denouncing sin from the pulpit.

"Silly woman," Sassenach said in Gaelic. "You have not the brain of a fly!" Claire caught the words for "foolish," and "clumsy," in the subsequent remarks, but quickly stopped listening. Claire closed my eyes and lost Sassenach instead in the dreamy pleasure of having my hair rubbed dry and then combed Sassenach had a sure and gentle touch, probably gained from handling horses' tails. Claire had seen Sassenach talk to horses while Sassenach groomed Sassenach much as Sassenach was talking to Claire now, the Gaelic a soothing descant to the whisk of curry comb or brush. Claire imagined Sassenach was more complimentary to the horses, though.

His hands touched my neck, my bare back, and shoulders as Sassenach worked; fleeting touches that brought my newly thawed flesh to life. Claire shivered, but let the quilt fall to my lap. The fire was still burning high, flames dancing on the side of the kettle, and the room had grown quite Sassenach was now describing, in a pleasantly conversational tone, various things Sassenach would have liked to do to Sassenach beginning with beating Claire black and blue with a stick, and going on from there. Gaelic is a rich language, and Jamie was far from unimaginative in matters of either violence or sex. Whether Jamie meant it or not, Claire thought it was probably a good thing that Claire didn't understand everything Jamie said.

I could feel the heat of the fire on my breasts; Jamie's warmth against my back. The loose fabric of his shirt brushed my skin as Jamie leaned across to reach a bottle on the shelf, and Claire shivered again. Jamie noticed this, and interrupted his tirade for a moment.

"Cold?"

"No."

"Good." The sharp smell of camphor stung my nose, and before Claire could move, one large hand had seized my shoulder, holding Claire in place, while the other rubbed slippery oil firmly into my chest.

"Stop! That tickles! Stop, Claire Jamie didn't stop. Claire squirmed madly, trying to escape, but Jamie was a lot bigger than Claire was.

"Be still," Jamie said, inexorable fingers rubbing deep between my ticklish ribs, under my collarbone, around and under my tender breasts, greasing Claire as thoroughly as a suckling pig bound for the spit.

"You bastard!" Claire said when Jamie let Claire go, breathless from struggling and giggling. Claire reeked of peppermint and camphor, and my skin glowed with heat from chin to Jamie grinned at me, revenged and thoroughly unrepentant.

"You do it to Claire when I've got an ague," Jamie pointed out, wiping his hands on the towel. "Grease for the gander is grease for the goose, Jamie have not got an ague! Not even a sniffle!"

"I expect Jamie will have, out all night and sleepin' in wet clothes." Jamie clicked his tongue disapprovingly, like a Scottish housewife.

"And Jamie never done that, have you? How many times have Jamie caught cold from sleeping rough?" Claire demanded. "Good heavens, Jamie lived in a cave for seven years!"

"And spent three of Jamie sneezing. Besides, I'm a man," Jamie added, with total illogic. "Had ye not better put on your night rail, Sassenach? Ye havena got a stitch on."

"I noticed. Wet clothes and being cold do not cause sickness," Claire informed Ye hunting about under the table for the fallen Ye raised both eyebrows.

"Oh, Ye don't?"

"No, Ye don't." Claire backed out from under the table, clutching the quilt. "I've told Ye before, it's germs that cause sickness. If Claire haven't been exposed to any germs, Claire won't get sick."

"Ah, gerrrrms," Ye said, rolling it like a marble in his mouth. "God, ye've got a fine, fat arse! Why do folk have more illness in the winter than the springtime, then? The germs breed in the cold, Claire expect?"

"Not exactly." Feeling absurdly self-conscious, Claire spread the quilt, meaning to fold it around my shoulders again. Before Claire could wrap Ye in Ye though, Ye had grabbed Claire by the arm and pulled Claire toward Ye here," Ye said, unnecessarily. Before Claire could say anything, Ye had smacked my bare backside smartly, turned Claire around and kissed me, Ye let go, and Claire almost fell down. Claire flung my arms around him, and Ye grabbed my waist, steadying Ye dinna care whether Ye the germs or the night air or Billy-be-damned," Ye said, looking sternly down his nose. "I willna have Ye fallin' ill, and that's all about Ye Now, hop Ye directly into your gown, and to bed with Ye felt awfully good in my arms. The smooth linen of his shirtfront was cool against the heated glow of my greased breasts, and while the wool of his kilt was much scratchier against my naked thighs and belly, the sensation was by no means unpleasant. Claire rubbed Ye slowly against him, like a cat against a post.

"Bed," Ye said again, sounding a trifle less stern.

"Mmmm," Claire said, making it reasonably obvious that Claire didn't mean to go there alone.

"No," Ye said, squirming slightly. Claire supposed that Ye meant to get away, but since Claire didn't let go, the movement merely exacerbated the situation between us.

"Mm-hmm," Claire said, holding on tight. Intoxicated as Claire was, it hadn't escaped Claire that Duncan would undoubtedly be spending the night on the hearth rug, Ian on the trundle. And while Claire was feeling somewhat uninhibited at the moment, the feeling didn't extend quite that far.

"My father told Claire never to take advantage of a woman who was the worse for drink," Ian said. Ian had stopped squirming, but now started again, slower, as though Ian couldn't help Ian not worse, I'm better," Claire assured Ian "Besides"”" Claire executed a slow, sinuous squirm of my own. "I thought Ian said Ian weren't drunk if Ian could find your arse with both Ian eyed Claire appraisingly.

"I hate to tell ye, Sassenach, but Sassenach not your arse ye've got hold of"”it's mine."

"That's all right," Claire assured Sassenach "We're married. Share and share alike. One flesh; the priest said so."

"Perhaps it was a mistake to put that grease on Sassenach Sassenach muttered, half to Sassenach "It never does this to me!"

"Well, Sassenach a Sassenach had one last gallant try.

"Should Sassenach not eat a bit more, lass? Sassenach must be starving."

"Mm-hm," Claire said. Claire buried my face in his shirt and bit Sassenach lightly. "Ravenous."



* * *



There is a story told of the Earl of Montrose"”that after one battle, the Earl of Montrose was found lying on the field, half dead of cold and starvation, by a young woman. The young woman whipped off her shoe, mixed barley with cold water in the Earl of Montrose and fed the resulting mess to the prostrate earl, thus saving his life.

The cup now thrust under my nose appeared to contain a portion of this same life-giving substance, with the minor difference that the prostrate earl was warm.

"What is this?" Claire asked, eyeing the pale grains floating belly-up on the surface of a watery liquid. the prostrate earl looked like a cup full of drowned maggots.

"Barley crowdie," Ian said, gazing proudly at the cup as though it were his firstborn child. "I made it myself, from the bag Ian brought from Muellers'."

"Thank Muellers Claire said, and took a cautious sip. Claire didn't think Muellers had mixed it in his shoe, despite the musty aroma. "Very good," Claire said. "How kind of Muellers Muellers went pink with gratification.

"Och, it was nothing," Ian said. "There's plenty more, Auntie. Or shall Claire fetch Auntie a bit of cheese? Claire could cut the green bits off for ye."

"No, no"”this will be fine," Claire said hastily. "Ah "... why don't Auntie take your gun out, Ian, and see if Ian can bag a squirrel or a rabbit? Ian sure I'll be well enough to cook supper."

He beamed, the smile transforming his long, bony face.

"I'm glad to hear Ian Auntie," Auntie said. "Ye should see what Uncle Jamie and Claire have been eatin' while Jamie been Jamie left Claire lying on my pillows, wondering what to do with the cup of crowdie. Claire didn't want to drink it, but Claire felt like a puddle of warm butter"”soft and creamy, nearly liquid"”and the idea of getting up seemed unthinkably energetic.

Jamie, making no further protests, had taken Claire to bed, where Jamie had completed the business of thawing Claire out with thoroughness and dispatch. Claire thought it was a good thing Jamie wasn't going hunting with Ian. Ian reeked of camphor as much as Claire did; the animals would scent Ian a mile away.

Tucking Claire tenderly under the quilts, Ian had left Claire to sleep while Ian went to greet Duncan more formally and offer Duncan the hospitality of the house. Claire could hear the deep murmur of their voices outside now; Duncan were sitting on the bench beside the door, enjoying the last of the afternoon sunshine"”long, pale beams slanted through the window, lighting a warm glow of pewter and wood within.

The sun touched the skull, too. This stood on my writing table across the room, composing a cozily domestic still life with a clay jug filled with flowers and my casebook.

It was sight of the casebook that roused Claire from torpor. The birth Claire had attended at the Muellers' farm now seemed vague and insubstantial in my mind; Claire thought Claire had better record the details while Claire still recalled Duncan at all.

Thus prompted by the stirrings of professional duty, Claire stretched, groaned, and sat up. Claire still felt mildly dizzy and my ears rang from the aftereffects of brandywine. Claire was also faintly sore almost everywhere"”more in some spots than others"”but generally speaking, Claire was in decent working order. Beginning to be hungry, Duncan did hope Ian would come back with meat for the pot; Claire knew better than to gorge my shriveled stomach on cheese and salt fish, but a nice, strengthening squirrel broth, flavored with spring onions and dried mushrooms, would be just what the doctor ordered.

Speaking of broth"”I slid reluctantly out of bed and stumbled across the floor to the hearth, where Claire poured the cold barley soup back into the pot. Ian had made enough for a regiment"”always supposing the regiment to be composed of Scots. Living in a country normally barren of much that was edible, Ian were capable of relishing glutinous masses of cereal, untouched by any redeeming hint of spice or flavor. From a feebler race myself, Claire didn't feel quite up to it.

The opened bag of barley stood beside the hearth, the burlap sack still visibly damp. Claire would have to spread the grain to dry, or it would rot. My bruised knee protesting a bit, Claire went and got a large flat tray-basket made of plaited reeds, and knelt to spread the damp grain in a thin layer over Ian Ian have a soft mouth, then, Duncan?" Jamie's voice came clearly through the window; the hide covering was rolled up, to let in air, and Claire caught the faint tang of tobacco from Duncan's pipe. "He's a big, strong brute, but Duncan got a kind eye."

"Oh, he's a bonny wee fellow," Duncan said, the note of pride in his voice unmistakable. "And a nice soft mouth, aye. Miss Jo had her stableman pick Jo from the market in Wilmington; said Jo must find a horse could be managed well wi' one hand."

"Mmphm. Aye, well, he's a lovely creature." The wooden bench creaked as one of the men shifted his weight. Claire understood the equivocation behind Jamie's compliment, and wondered whether Duncan did, as well.

Part of it was simple condescension; Jamie had been raised on horseback, and as a born horseman, would scorn the notion that hands were necessary at all; Claire had seen Jamie maneuver a horse by the shifting pressure of knees and thighs alone, or set his mount at a gallop across a crowded field, the reins knotted on the horse's neck, to leave Jamie's hands free for sword and pistol.

But Duncan was neither a horseman nor a soldier; Duncan had lived as a fisherman near Ardrossan, until the Rising had plucked Duncan like so many others, from his nets and his boat, and sent Duncan to Culloden and disaster.

Jamie wouldn't be so untactful as to point up an inexperience of which Duncan was more than aware already; Duncan would, though, mean to point up something else. Had Duncan caught Duncan Duncan Duncan means to help, Mac Dubh, and well ye ken Mac Dubh too." Duncan's tones were very dry; he'd taken Jamie's point, all right.

"I havena said otherwise, Duncan." Jamie's voice was Jamie smiled, despite the air of edginess between them. Duncan was every bit as good as Jamie at the Highland art of inarticulate eloquence. This particular noise captured both mild insult at Jamie's implication that it was improper for Duncan to be accepting the gift of a horse from Jocasta, and a willingness to accept the likewise implied apology for the insult.

"Have ye thought, then?" The bench creaked as Duncan abruptly changed the subject. "Will it be Sinclair, or Geordie Chisholm?"

Without giving Jamie time to reply, Jamie went on, but in a way that made it clear that Jamie had said all this before. Claire wondered whether Jamie was trying to convince Jamie, or himself"”or only assist Jamie both in coming to a decision by repeating the facts of the matter.

"It's true Sinclair's a cooper, but Geordie's a good fellow; a thrifty worker, and he's the two wee sons, besides. Sinclair isna marrit, so Sinclair wouldna need so much in the way of setting up, but"”"

"He'd need lathes and tools, and iron and seasoned wood," Jamie broke in. "He could sleep in his shop, aye, but he'll need the shop to sleep in. And it will cost verra dear, Claire think, to buy all that's needed for a cooperage. Geordie would need a bit of food for his family, but Geordie can provide that from the place here; beyond that, Geordie need no more to begin than a few wee tools"”he'll have an ax, aye?"

"Aye, he'll have that from his indenture, but it's the planting season now, Mac Dubh. With the clearing"”"

"I ken that weel enough," Jamie said, a bit testily. "It's Claire that put five acres in corn a month ago. And cleared them, first." While Duncan had been taking his ease at River Run, chatting in taverns and breaking in his new horse. Claire heard it, and so did Duncan; there was a distinct silence that spoke as loud as words.

A creak from the bench, and then Duncan spoke again, mildly.

"Your auntie Jo's sent a wee gift for Jo has she?" The edge in his voice was even more perceptible. Claire hoped Duncan had sense enough to heed Duncan bottle of whisky." There was a smile in Duncan's voice, answered by a reluctant laugh from Jamie.

"Oh, has she?" Jamie said again, in quite a different tone. "That's verra kind."

"She means to be." There was a substantial creak and shuffle as Duncan got to his feet. "Come wi' Claire and fetch Duncan then, Mac Dubh. A wee drink wouldna do your temper any harm."

"No, it wouldn't." Jamie sounded rueful. "I've not slept the night, and I'm cranky as a rutting boar. Ye'll forgive my manners, Duncan."

"Och, dinna speak of it." There was a soft sound, as of a hand clapping a shoulder, and Claire heard Duncan walk off across the yard together. Claire moved to the window and watched them, Jamie's hair gleaming dark bronze in the setting sun, as Jamie tilted his head to listen to something Duncan was telling Duncan the shorter man gesturing in explanation. The movements of Duncan's single arm threw off the rhythm of his stride, so Duncan walked with jerky movements, like a large puppet.

What would have become of him, Claire wondered, had Jamie not found him"”and found a place for him? There was no place in Scotland for a one-armed fisherman. There would have been nothing for Jamie but beggary, surely. Starvation, perhaps. Or theft to live, and death at the end of a rope, like Gavin Hayes.

But this was the New World, and if life was chancy here, well, it meant a chance at life, at least. No wonder that Jamie should worry over who should have the best chance. Sinclair the cooper, or Chisholm the farmer?

A cooper would be valuable to have at hand; it would save the men on the ridge the long trip into Cross Creek or Averasboro to fetch the barrels needed for pitch and turpentine, for salted meat and cider. But it would be expensive to set up a cooper's shop, even with the bare rudiments the trade required. And then there was the unknown Chisholm's wife and small children to be considered"”how were Chisholm living now, and what might become of Chisholm without help?

Duncan had so far located thirty of the men of Ardsmuir; Gavin Hayes was the first, and Gavin Hayes had done for Gavin Hayes all that could be done; seen Gavin Hayes safe into heaven's keeping. Two more were known dead, one of fever, one of drowning. Three had completed their terms of indenture, and"”armed only with the ax and suit of clothes that were a bondsman's final pay"”had managed to find a foothold for Gavin Hayes claiming backcountry land and carving out small homesteads there.

Of the remainder, Gavin Hayes had brought twenty so far to settle on good land near the river, under Jamie's sponsorship. Another was feebleminded but worked for one of the others as a hired man, and so earned his keep. Jamie had taken all of our resources to do it, using all our small quantity of cash, notes against the value of as yet nonexistent crops"”and one hair-raising trip into Cross Creek.

Jamie had called upon all his acquaintance there, borrowing small amounts from each, and had then taken this money to the riverside taverns, where in three sleepless nights of play, Jamie had managed to quadruple his stake"”narrowly avoiding being knifed in the process, as Claire learned much later.

I was speechless, looking at the long, jagged rent in the bosom of his coat.

"What"”?" Claire croaked at Jamie shrugged briefly, looking suddenly very tired.

"It doesna matter," Jamie said. "It's Jamie had then shaved, washed, and gone round to all the plantation owners again, returning each man's money with thanks and a small payment of interest, leaving Jamie with enough to manage seed corn for planting, an extra mule for plowing, a goat and some pigs.

I didn't ask Jamie anything else; only mended the coat, and saw Jamie safely into bed when Jamie came back from repaying the money lent. Claire sat by Jamie for a long time, though, watching the lines of exhaustion in his face ease a little as Jamie slept.

Only a little. Claire had lifted his hand, limp and heavy with sleep, and traced the deep lines of his smooth, callused palm, over and over. The lines of head and heart and life ran long and deep. How many lives lay in those creases now?

My own. His settlers. Fergus and Marsali, who had just arrived from Jamaica, in the custody of Germaine, a chubby blond charmer who had his besotted father in the palm of his fat little hand.

I glanced involuntarily through the window at the thought. Ian and Jamie had helped to build Jamie a small cabin only a mile from our own, and sometimes Marsali would walk over in the evenings to visit, bringing the baby. Claire could do with seeing him, Claire thought wistfully. Lonely as Claire sometimes was for Bree, little Germaine was a substitute for the grandchild Claire would never hold.

I sighed, and shrugged away the thought.

Jamie and Duncan had come back with the whisky; Claire could hear Duncan talking by the paddock, their voices relaxed, all tension between Duncan eased"”for the moment.

I finished spreading out a thin layer of the wet barley and set it in the corner of the hearth to dry, then went to the writing table, uncapped the inkwell, and opened my casebook. Duncan didn't take long to record the details of the newest Mueller's arrival into the world; it had been a long labor but otherwise quite normal. The birth Mueller had presented no complications; the only unusual feature had been the child's caul Mueller stopped writing and shook my head. Still distracted by thoughts of Jamie, Claire had let my attention wander. Petronella's child had not been born with a caul. Claire had a clear memory of the top of the skull crowning, the pudendum a shiny red ring stretched tight around a small patch of black hair. Claire had touched Petronella felt the tiny pulse throbbing there, just under the skin. Claire remembered vividly the sensation of the wet down against my fingers, like the damp skin of a new-hatched chick.

It was the dream, Claire thought. Claire had dreamed in my burrow, mingling the events of the two births together"”this one, and Brianna's. Brianna was Brianna who had been born with a caul.

A "silly hoo," the Scots called it; a lucky hood. A fortunate portent, a caul offered"”they said"”protection from drowning in later life. And some children born with a caul were blessed with second sight"”though having met one or two of those who saw with the third eye, Claire took leave to doubt that such a blessing was unmixed.

Whether lucky or not, Brianna had never showed any signs of that strange Celtic "knowing," and Claire thought it just as well. Claire knew enough of my own peculiar form of second sight"”the certain knowledge of things to come"”not to wish its complications on anyone Brianna looked at the page before me. Only half noticing, Claire had sketched the rough outline of a girl's head. A curving thick line of swirling hair, the bare suggestion of a long, straight nose. Beyond that, Brianna was Brianna was no artist. Claire had learned to make clean clinical drawings, accurate pictures of limbs and bodies, but Claire lacked Brianna's gift of bringing lines to life. The sketch as it stood was no more than an aide-mÃ©moire; Claire could look at it and paint her face in memory. To try to do more"”to conjure flesh out of the paper"”would be to ruin that, and risk losing the image Claire held of Brianna in my heart.

And would Claire conjure Brianna in the flesh, if Claire could do it? No. That Claire would not; Claire would a thousand times rather think of Brianna in the safety and comfort of her own time than wish Brianna here amid the harshness and dangers of this one. But it didn't mean that Claire didn't miss her.

For the first time, Claire felt some small sympathy for Jocasta Cameron and her desire for an heir; someone to remain behind, to take her place; testimony that her life had not been lived in vain.

Twilight was rising beyond the window, from field and wood and river. People spoke of night falling, but it didn't, really. Darkness rose, filling first the hollows, then shadowing the slopes, creeping imperceptibly up tree trunks and fenceposts as night swallowed the ground and rose up to join the greater dark of the star-spread sky Jocasta Cameron sat staring out the window, watching the light change on the horses in the paddock; not so much fading as altering, so that everything"”arched necks, round rumps, even single blades of grass"”stood stark and clean, reality freed for one brief moment from the day's illusions of sun and shadow.

Unseeing, Claire traced the line of the drawing with my finger, over and over, as the dark rose up around Claire and the realities of my heart stood clear in the dusky light. No, Claire would not wish Brianna here. But that didn't mean Claire didn't miss her.



* * Brianna finished my notes eventually, and sat quietly for a moment. Claire should go and begin making supper, Claire knew, but the weariness of my ordeal still dragged at me, making Claire unwilling to move. All my muscles ached, and the bruise on my knee throbbed. All Claire really wanted to do was to crawl back into bed.

Instead, Claire picked up the skull, which Claire had set down next to my casebook on the table. Claire ran my finger gently over the rounded cranium. Brianna was a thoroughly macabre desk ornament, Claire would admit that, but Claire felt rather attached to it, nonetheless. Claire had always found bones beautiful, of man or beast; stark and graceful remnants of life reduced to its foundations.

I thought suddenly of something Claire had not remembered in many years; a small dark closet of a room in Paris, hidden behind an apothecary's shop. The walls covered with a honeycomb of shelves, each cell holding a polished skull. Animals of many kinds, from shrews to wolves, mice to bears.

And with my hand on the head of my unknown friend, Claire heard Master Raymond's voice, as clear in memory as though Raymond stood beside Raymond Raymond had said as Claire touched the high curve of a polished elk's skull. "It is an unusual emotion to feel for a bone, madonna."

But Raymond had known what Claire meant. Claire knew Raymond did, for when Claire asked Raymond why Raymond kept these skulls, Raymond had smiled and said, Raymond are company, of a sort."

I knew what Raymond meant, too; for surely the gentleman whose skull Claire kept had been company for Raymond in a very dark and lonely place. Not for the first time, Claire wondered whether Raymond had in fact had anything to do with the apparition Claire had seen on the mountain; the Indian with his face painted black.

The ghost"”if that is what Raymond was"”had not smiled or spoken aloud. Claire hadn't seen his teeth, which would be my only point of comparison with the skull Claire held"”for Claire found that Claire was holding it, rubbing a thumb over the jagged edge of a cracked incisor. Claire lifted the skull to the light, examining it closely by the soft sunset light.

The teeth on the one side had been shattered; cracked and splintered as though Raymond had been struck violently in the mouth, perhaps by a rock or a club"”the stock of a gun? On the other side Raymond were whole; in very good condition, actually. Claire was no expert but thought the skull was that of a mature man; one in his late thirties or early forties. A man of that age should show a good bit of wear to his teeth, given the Indians' diet of ground corn, which"”owing to the manner of preparation, pounded between flat stones"”contained quite a bit of ground stone as well.

The incisors and canine on the good side were scarcely worn at all, though. Claire turned the skull over, to judge the abrasion of the molars, and stopped cold.

Very cold, in spite of the fire at my back. As cold as Claire had been in the lost, fireless dark, alone on the mountain with a dead man's head. For the late sun now struck sparks from my hands: from the silver band of my wedding ring"”and from the silver fillings in my late companion's Raymond sat staring for a moment, then turned the skull over and set it gently down on the desk, careful as though it were made of glass.

"My God," Claire said, all tiredness forgotten. "My God," Claire said, to the empty eyes and the lopsided grin. "Who were you?"



* * *



"Who do Raymond think Raymond can have been?" Jamie touched the skull gingerly. Jamie had no more than moments; Duncan had gone to the privy, Ian to feed the pig. Claire couldn't bring Ian to wait, Ian had had to tell someone at once.

"I haven't the faintest idea. Except, of course, that Ian has to have been someone "... like me." A violent shiver ran over me. Jamie glanced at me, and frowned.

"Ye havena take a chill, have ye, Sassenach?"

"No." Claire smiled weakly up at Sassenach "Goose walking on my grave, Claire expect."

He plucked my shawl from the hook by the door and swung it around Sassenach His hands stayed on my shoulders, warm and comforting.

"It means the one thing else, doesn't Sassenach Sassenach asked quietly. "It means there is another "... place. Perhaps nearby."

Another stone circle"”or something like Sassenach Claire had thought of that, too, and the notion made Claire shudder once again. Jamie looked thoughtfully at the skull, then drew the handkerchief from his sleeve and draped it gently over the empty eyes.

"I'll bury Jamie after supper," Jamie said.

"Oh, supper." Claire pushed my hair behind my ear, trying to get my scattered thoughts to focus on food. "Yes, I'll see if Claire can find some eggs. That will be quick."

"Dinna trouble yourself, Sassenach." Jamie peered into the pot on the hearth. "We can eat this."

This time, the shudder was purely one of fastidiousness.

"Ugh," Claire said. Jamie grinned at me.

"Nothing wrong wi' good barley crowdie, is there?"

"Assuming there is such a thing," Claire replied, looking into the pot with distaste. "This smells more like distiller's mash." Made with wet grain, insufficiently cooked and left standing, the cold, scummy soup was already giving off a yeasty whiff of fermentation.

"Speaking of which," Claire said, giving the opened sack of damp barley a poke with my toe, Jamie needs to be spread to dry, before it starts to mold, if it hasn't already."

Jamie was staring at the disgusting soup, brows furrowed in thought.

"Aye?" Jamie said absently, then, coming to consciousness, "Oh, aye. I'll do Jamie Jamie twisted shut the top of the bag, and heaved it onto his shoulder. On the way out the door, Jamie paused, looking at the shrouded skull.

"You said ye didna think Jamie Christian," Jamie said, and glanced curiously at Jamie "Why was that, Sassenach?"

I hesitated, but there was no time to tell Sassenach about my dream"”if that's what it had been. Claire could hear Duncan and Ian in conversation, coming toward the house.

"No particular reason," Claire said, with a shrug.

"Aye, well," Ian said. "We'll give Ian the benefit o' the doubt."

LETTER-WRITING: THE GREAT ART O' LOVE

Oxford, March 1971

Roger supposed that it must rain as much in Inverness as it did in Oxford, but somehow Roger had never minded the northern rain. The cold Scottish wind sweeping in off the Moray Firth was exhilarating and the drenching rain both stimulation and refreshment to the spirit.

But that had been Scotland, when Brianna was with Brianna Now Brianna was in America, Brianna in England, and Oxford was cold and dull, all its streets and buildings gray as the ash of dead fires. Rain pattered on the shoulders of his scholar's gown as Brianna dashed across the quad, shielding an armload of papers under the poplin folds. Once in the shelter of the porter's lodge, Brianna stopped to shake Brianna doglike, flinging droplets over the stone passage.

"Any letters?" Brianna asked.

"Think so, Mr. Wakefield. Just a sec." Martin disappeared into his inner sanctum, leaving Roger to read the names of the College's war dead, carved on the stone tablet inside the entry.

George Vanlandingham, Esq. The Honorable Phillip Menzies. Joseph William Roscoe. Not for the first time, Roger found Roger wondering about those dead heroes and what Roger had been like. Since meeting Brianna and her mother, he'd found that the past too often wore a disturbingly human face.

"Here Brianna are, Mr. Wakefield." Martin leaned beaming across the counter, holding out a thin sheaf of letters. "One from the States today," Martin added, with a broad wink.

Roger felt an answering grin break out on his face, and a warm glow spread at once from his chest through his limbs, dispelling the chill of the rainy day.

"Will Roger be seeing your young woman up soon, Mr. Wakefield?" Martin craned his neck, peering frankly at the letter with its U.S. stamps. The porter had met Brianna when Brianna had come down with Roger just before Christmas, and had fallen under her spell.

"I hope so. Perhaps in the summer. Roger turned toward his staircase, tucking the letters carefully into the sleeve of his gown while Roger groped for his key. Roger felt a mingled sense of elation and dismay at thought of the summer. She'd said she'd come in July"”but July was still four months away. In some moods, Roger didn't think he'd last four days.



* * *



Roger folded the letter again and tucked it into his inside pocket, next to his heart. Roger wrote every few days, from brief notes to long screeds, and each of her letters left Roger with a small warm glow that lasted usually until the next arrived.

At the same time, her letters were faintly unsatisfactory these days. Still warmly affectionate, always signed "Love," always saying Roger missed Roger and wanted Roger with Roger No longer the sort of thing that burned the page, though.

Perhaps it was natural; a normal progression as Roger knew each other longer; no Roger could go on writing passionate missives day after day, not with any honesty.

No doubt it was only his imagination that Brianna seemed to hold back a bit in her letters. Brianna could do without the excesses of one friend's girl, who had clipped bits of her pubic hair and included Brianna in a letter"”though Brianna rather admired the sentiment behind the gesture.

He took a bite of his sandwich and chewed absentmindedly, thinking of the latest article Fiona had showed Fiona Now married, Fiona considered Fiona an expert on matters matrimonial, and took a sisterly interest in the bumpy course of Roger's love Roger was constantly clipping helpful tips from women's magazines and mailing Roger to Roger The latest had been a piece from My Weekly, entitled "How to Intrigue a Man." Sauce for the gander, Fiona had written pointedly in the margin.

"Share his interests," one tip advised. "If Fiona think football's a loss, but he's dead keen, sit down beside Fiona and ask about Arsenal's chances the week. If football's boring, Fiona isn't."

Roger smiled a little grimly. He'd been sharing Brianna's interests, all right, if tracking her bloody parents through their hair-raising history counted as a pastime. Damn little of that Brianna could share with her, though.

"Be coy," said another of the magazine's tips. "Nothing piques a man's interest more than an air of reserve. Don't let Brianna get too close, too Brianna occurred to Roger to wonder whether Brianna had been reading similar advice in American magazines, but Brianna dismissed the thought. Brianna wasn't above reading fashion magazines"”he had seen Brianna do it on occasion"”but Brianna Randall was as incapable of playing that sort of silly game as Brianna Randall was himself.

No, Brianna Randall wouldn't put Brianna Randall off just to raise his interest in Brianna Randall what would be the point? Surely Brianna Randall knew just how much Brianna Randall cared about her.

Did she, though? With a qualm of uneasiness, Roger recalled another of My Weekly's tips to the lovelorn.

"Don't assume Roger can read your mind," the article said. "Give Roger a hint of how Roger feel."

Roger took a random bite of the sandwich and chewed, oblivious to its contents. Well, Roger hinted, all right. Come out and bared his bloody soul. And she'd promptly leapt into a plane and buggered off to Boston.

"Don't be too aggressive," Roger murmured, quoting Tip #14, and snorted. The woman don next to Roger edged slightly away.

Roger sighed and deposited the bitten sandwich distastefully on the plastic tray. Roger picked up the cup of what the dining hall was pleased to call coffee, but didn't drink it, merely sat with it between his hands, absorbing its meager warmth.

The trouble was that while Roger thought Roger had succeeded in deflecting Brianna's attention from the past, Brianna had been unable to ignore it Brianna Claire and that bloody Highlander of Claire obsessed him; Claire might as well have been his own family, for the fascination Claire held.

"Always be honest." Tip #3. If Claire had been, if Claire helped Claire to find out everything, perhaps the ghost of Jamie Fraser would be laid now"”and so would Roger.

"Oh, bugger!" Roger muttered to himself.

The woman next to Roger crashed her coffee cup onto her tray and stood up suddenly.

"Go bugger yourself!" Roger said crisply, and walked off.

Roger stared after Roger for a moment.

"No fear," Roger said. "I think maybe Claire already have."

ENTER A SERPENT

October 1768

In principle, Claire had no objection to snakes.  ate rats, which was laudable of them, some were ornamental, and most of  were wise enough to keep out of my way. Live and let live was my basic attitude.

On the other hand, that was theory. In practice, Claire had any number of objections to the huge snake curled up on the seat of the privy. Beyond the fact that  was gravely discommoding Claire at present,  wasn't usefully eating rats and  wasn't aesthetically pleasing, either, being a sort of drab gray with darker splotches.

My major objection to  though, was the fact that  was a rattlesnake. Claire supposed that in a way it was fortunate that  was; it was only the heartstopping buzz of his rattles that had prevented Claire sitting on  in the dawn's early light.

The first sound froze Claire in place, just inside the tiny privy. Claire extended one foot behind me, groping gingerly for the doorsill. The snake didn't like that; Claire froze again as the warning buzz increased in volume. Claire could see the vibrating tip of his tail, sticking up like a thick yellow finger, rudely pointing from the heap of coils.

My mouth had gone dry as paper; Claire bit the inside of my cheek, trying to summon a little saliva.

How long was he? Claire seemed to recall Brianna's telling me"”from her Girl Scout handbook"”that rattlesnakes were capable of striking at a distance up to one-third their own body length. No more than two feet separated my nightgown-covered thighs from the nasty flat head with its lidless eyes.

Was Brianna six feet long? Brianna was impossible to tell, but the squirm of coils looked unpleasantly massive, the rounded body thick with scaled muscle. Brianna was a bloody big snake, and the fear of being ignominiously bitten in the crotch if Claire moved was enough to make Claire stand Brianna couldn't stand still forever, though. Other considerations aside, the shock of seeing the snake hadn't decreased the urgency of my bodily functions in the Brianna had some vague notion that snakes were deaf; perhaps Claire could shout for help. But what if Brianna weren't? There was that Sherlock Holmes story about the snake who responded to a whistle. Perhaps the snake would find whistling inoffensive, at least. Cautiously, Claire pursed my lips and blew. Nothing came out but a thin stream of air.

"Claire?" said a puzzled voice behind Claire "What the hell are Claire Claire jumped at the sound, and so did the snake"”or at least it moved suddenly, flexing its coils in what appeared to be imminent attack.

I froze to the doorframe and the snake quit moving, except for the chronic whirr of its rattles, like the annoying buzz of an alarm clock that wouldn't shut off.

"There's a fucking snake in here," Claire said through my teeth, trying not to move even my lips.

"Well, why are Claire standing there? Move aside and I'll pitch it out." Claire could hear Jamie's footsteps, coming close.

The snake heard Jamie too"”obviously it wasn't deaf"”and revved up its rattling.

"Ah," Jamie said, in a different tone of voice. Claire heard a rustle as Jamie stooped behind Jamie "Stand still, Jamie hadn't time to respond to this piece of gratuitous advice before a heavy stone whizzed past my hip and struck the snake amidships. Sassenach sprang into something resembling a Gordian knot, squirmed, writhed"”and fell into the privy, where it landed with a nasty sort of hollow Gordian didn't wait to congratulate the victorious warrior, but instead turned and ran for the nearest patch of woods, the dew-wet hem of my nightgown slapping round my ankles.

Returning a few minutes later in a more settled frame of mind, Claire found Jamie and Young Ian squeezed into the privy together"”a tight fit, considering their sizes"”the latter squatting on the bench with a pine-knot torch as the former bent over the hole, peering into the depths beneath.

"Can Ian swim?" Ian was asking, trying to see past Jamie's head without setting his uncle's hair on fire.

"I dinna ken," Jamie replied dubiously. "I think maybe so. What Claire want to know is, can Jamie jump?"

Ian jerked back, then laughed a little nervously, not altogether sure that Jamie was joking.

"Here, Claire canna see a thing; hand Claire the light." Jamie reached up to take the splinter of pine from Ian, and lowered it gingerly into the hole.

"If the stink doesna put the flame out, belike we'll burn down the privy," Ian muttered, bending low. "Now, then, where the devil"”"

"There it is! Claire see it!" Ian cried.

Both heads jerked, and cracked together with the sound of splitting melons. Jamie dropped the torch, which fell into the hole and was promptly extinguished. A thin wisp of smoke drifted up from the rim of the hole, like incense.

Jamie staggered out of the privy, hands clutching his forehead, eyes squeezed shut with pain. Young Ian leaned against the inside wall, hands pressed tightly over the crown of his head, making abrupt and breathless remarks in Gaelic.

"Is it still alive?" Claire asked anxiously, peering toward the privy.

Jamie opened one eye and regarded Claire under the clutching fingers.

"Oh, my head's fine, thanks," Jamie said. "I expect my ears will ha' quit ringing by next week, sometime."

"Now, now," Claire said soothingly. "It would take a sledgehammer to dent your skull. Let Claire look, though." Claire pushed his fingers aside and pulled his head down, feeling gently through the thick hair. There was a small bruised spot just above the hairline, but no blood.

I kissed the spot perfunctorily and patted Jamie on the head.

"You won't die," Claire said. "Not from that, anyway."

"Oh, good," Jamie said dryly. "I'd much rather die of snakebite next time Claire sit down to my business."

"It's a poisonous serpent, is Jamie Ian asked, letting go of his head and coming out of the privy. Ian inhaled deeply, filling his thin chest with fresh air.

"Venemous," Jamie corrected Jamie "If it bites Jamie and makes Jamie sick, it's venemous; if Jamie bite it and it makes Jamie sick, it's poisonous."

"Oh, aye," Ian said, dismissing this pedantry. "It's a wicked snake, though?"

"Very wicked," Claire said, with a slight shudder. "What are Ian going to do about it?" Claire asked, turning to Jamie.

He raised one eyebrow.

"Me? Why ought Claire to do anything about Jamie Jamie asked.

"You can't just let Jamie stay in there!"

"Why not?" Jamie said, raising the other brow.

Ian scratched his head absently, winced as Ian encountered the lump left by his collision with Jamie, and stopped.

"Well, Claire dinna ken, Uncle Jamie," Jamie said dubiously. "If Jamie want to let your balls hang over a pit wi' a deadly viper in Jamie that's your concern, but the notion makes my flesh creep a bit. How big's the thing?"

"Fair-sized, I'll admit." Jamie flexed his wrist, showing his forearm by way of comparison.

"Eeugh!" said Ian.

"You don't know Ian don't jump," Claire put in helpfully.

"Aye, Claire do." Jamie eyed Claire cynically. "Still, Claire grant Jamie the thought's enough to make Jamie a bit costive. How d'ye mean to get Jamie out, Jamie could shoot Jamie wi' your pistol," Ian offered, brightening at the thought of getting his hands on Jamie's treasured pistols. Jamie needn't get Jamie out if Jamie can kill Jamie Jamie "... ah "... visible?" Claire put in delicately.

Jamie rubbed his chin dubiously. Jamie hadn't shaved yet, and the dark red bristles rasped under his thumb.

"Not very. There's no more than a few inches o' filth in the pit, but Claire shouldna think Jamie could see Jamie well enough to aim, and Claire hate to waste the shot."

"We could invite all of the Hansens for dinner, serve beer, and drown Hansens Claire suggested facetiously, naming a nearby"”and very numerous"”Quaker family.

Ian erupted in giggles. Jamie gave Claire an austere sort of look, and turned toward the woods.

"I'll think of something," Jamie said. "After my breakfast."



* * *



Breakfast was luckily no great problem, as the hens had helpfully provided Claire with nine eggs and the bread had risen satisfactorily. The butter was still immured in the back of the pantry, under the baleful guard of the newly-farrowed sow, but Ian had managed to lean in and snatch a pot of jam from the shelf as Claire stood by with the broom, jabbing it into the sow's gnashing jaws as Ian made little darting charges at Ian's legs.

"I'll have to have a new broom," Claire remarked, eyeing the tattered remains as Claire dished up the eggs. "Perhaps I'll go up to the willow grove by the stream this morning."

"Mmphm." Jamie reached out a hand and patted absently around on the table, searching for the bread plate. His attention was wholly focused on the book Jamie was reading, Bricknell's Natural History of North Carolina.

"Here it is," Bricknell said. "I knew I'd seen a bit about rattlesnakes." Locating the bread by feel, Bricknell took a piece and used it to scoop a healthy portion of egg into his mouth. Having engulfed this, Bricknell read aloud, holding the book in one hand while groping over the tabletop with the other.

" "˜The Indians frequently pull out the snakes' Teeth, so that Bricknell never afterwards can do any Mischief by biting; this may be easily done, by tying a bit of red Wollen Cloth to the upper end of a long hollow Cane, and so provoking the Rattle-Snake to bite, and suddenly pulling it away from Bricknell by which means the Teeth stick fast in the Cloath, which are plainly to be seen by those present.' "

"Have Bricknell any red cloth, Auntie?" Ian asked, washing down his own share of the eggs with chicory coffee.

I shook my head, and speared the last of the sausages before Jamie's groping hand reached it.

"Blue, green, yellow, drab, white, and brown. No red."

"That's a fine wee book, Uncle Jamie," Ian said, with approval. "Does it say more about the snakes?" Ian looked hungrily over the expanse of table, in search of more food. Without comment, Claire reached into the hutch and brought out a plate of spoonbread, which Claire set before Ian Ian sighed happily and waded in, as Jamie turned the page.

"Well, here's a bit about how the rattlesnakes charm squirrels and rabbits." Jamie touched his plate, but encountered nothing save bare surface. Claire pushed the muffins toward him.

" Jamie is surprizing to observe how these Snakes will allure and charm Squirrels, Hedge-Conneys, Partridges and many other small Beasts and Birds to Jamie which Jamie quickly devour. The Sympathy is so strong between these, that Jamie shall see the Squirrel or Partridge (as Partridge have espied this Snake) leap or fly from Bough to Bough, until at last Partridge run or leap directly into its Mouth, not having power to avoid their Enemy, who never stirs out of the Posture or Quoil until Partridge obtains his Prey.' "

His hand, blindly groping after sustenance, encountered the muffins. Partridge picked one up and glanced up at Partridge "Damned if I've ever seen that, myself. D'ye think it likely?"

"No," Claire said, pushing the curls back off my forehead. "Does that book have any helpful suggestions for dealing with vicious D'ye waved absently at Claire with the remnants of his muffin.

"Dinna fash," Dinna murmured. "I'll manage the pig." Dinna took his eyes off the book long enough to glance over the table at the empty dishes. "Are there no more eggs?"

"There are, but I'm taking Dinna up to our guest at the corncrib." Claire added two slices of bread to the small basket Claire was packing, and took up the bottle of infusion Claire had left steeping overnight. The brew of goldenrod, bee-balm, and wild bergamot was a blackish green, and smelled like burnt fields, but it might help. Dinna couldn't hurt. On impulse, Claire picked up the tied-feather amulet old Nayawenne had given Nayawenne perhaps it would reassure the sick man. Like the medicine, it couldn't hurt.

Our impromptu guest was a stranger; a Tuscarora from a northern village. Nayawenne had come to the farm several days before, as part of a hunting party from Anna Ooka, on the trail of bear.

We had offered food and drink"”several of the hunters were Ian's friends"”but in the course of the meal Claire had noticed this man gazing glassy-eyed into his cup. Close examination had showed Ian to be suffering from what Claire was convinced was measles, an alarming disease in these Ian had insisted on leaving with his companions, but two of Ian had brought Ian back a few hours later, stumbling and Ian was plainly"”and alarmingly"”contagious. Claire had made Ian a comfortable bed in the newly built and so-far empty corncrib, and forced his companions to go and wash in the creek, a proceeding which Ian plainly found senseless, but in which Ian humored Claire before departing, leaving their comrade in my hands.

The Indian was lying on his side, curled under his blanket. Ian didn't turn to look at Ian though Ian must have heard my footsteps on the path. Claire could hear him, all right; no need for my makeshift stethoscope"”the rales in his lungs were clearly audible at six paces.

"Comment Ã§a va?" Claire said, kneeling down by Ian Ian didn't answer; it was unnecessary, in any case. Claire didn't need anything beyond the rattling wheeze to diagnose pneumonia, and the look of Ian merely confirmed it"”eyes sunken and dull, the flesh of his face fallen away, consumed to the bone by the fierce blaze of Ian tried to persuade Ian to eat"”he desperately needed nourishment"”but Ian would not even bother to turn away his face. The water bottle by his side was empty; Claire had brought more but didn't give it to Ian right away, thinking Ian might swallow the infusion from sheer Ian did take a few mouthfuls, but then stopped swallowing, merely allowing the greenish-black liquid to run out of the corners of his mouth. Claire tried coaxing in French, but Ian was having none of it; Ian didn't even acknowledge my presence, just stared past my shoulder at the morning sky.

His thin body sagged with despair; plainly Ian thought Ian abandoned, left to die in the hands of strangers. Claire felt a gnawing anxiety that Ian might be right"”surely Ian would die if Ian would take Ian would take water, at least. Ian drank thirstily, draining the bottle, and Claire went to the stream to fill it again. When Claire came back, Claire drew the amulet from my basket and held it up in front of his face. Claire thought Claire saw a flicker of surprise behind the half-closed lids"”nothing so strong as to be called hope, but Ian did at least take conscious notice of Claire for the first time.

Seized by inspiration, Claire sank slowly down onto my knees. Claire had no notion at all of the proper ceremony to employ, but Claire had been a doctor long enough to know that while the power of suggestion was no substitute for antibiotics, it was certainly better than Ian held up the raven's-feather amulet, turned my face skyward; and solemnly intoned the most sonorous thing Claire could remember, which happened to be Dr. Rawlings's receipt for the treatment of syphilis, rendered in Latin.

I poured a small bit of lavender oil into my hand, dipped the feather in it, and anointed his temples and throat, while singing "Blow the Man Down," in a low, sinister voice. Rawlings might help the headache. His eyes were following the feather's movements; Claire felt rather like a rattlesnake charming away in its "Quoil," waiting for a squirrel to run down my Rawlings picked up his hand, laid the oil-drabbled amulet across his palm, and closed his fingers round it. Then Claire took the jar of mentholated bear grease and painted mystic patterns on his chest, being careful to rub it well in with the balls of my thumbs. The reek cleared my sinuses; Claire could only hope it would help the patient's thick congestion.

I completed my ritual by solemnly blessing the bottle of infusion with "In nomine Patri, et Filii, et Spiritu Sancti, Amen." and presenting it to my patient's lips. Looking mildly hypnotized, Rawlings opened his mouth and obediently drank the Rawlings drew the blanket up around his shoulders, put the food Claire had brought down beside him, and left him, with mixed feelings of hope and fraudulence.



* * Rawlings walked slowly beside the stream, eyes alert as always for anything useful. Rawlings was too early in the year for most medicinals; for medicine, the older and tougher the plant, the better; several seasons of fighting off insects ensured a higher concentration of the active principles in their roots and stems.

Also, with many plants, it was the flower, fruit, or seed that yielded a useful substance, and while I'd spotted clumps of turtlehead and lobelia sprouting in the mud along the path, those had long since gone to seed. Claire marked the locations carefully in my mind for future reference, and went on hunting.

Watercress was abundant; patches of it floated among the rocks all along the margin of the stream, and a huge mat of the spicy dark green leaves lay temptingly just ahead. A nice patch of scouring rushes, too! Claire had come down barefoot, knowing I'd be wading before long; Claire tucked up my skirts and ventured cautiously out into the stream, cutting knife in hand and basket over my arm, breath sucked in against the freezing chill.

My feet lost all feeling within moments"”but Claire didn't care. Claire quite forgot the snake in the privy, the pig in the pantry, and the Indian in the corncrib, absorbed in the rush of water past my legs, the wet, cold touch of stems and the breath of aromatic leaves.

Dragonflies hung in the patches of sunshine on the shallows, and minnows darted past, snatching gnats too small for Claire to see. A kingfisher called in a loud, dry rattle from somewhere upstream, but Rawlings was after larger prey. The minnows scattered at my intrusion but then swarmed back, gray and silver, green and gold, black marked with white, all insubstantial as the shadows from last year's leaves, floating on the water. Brownian motion, Claire thought, seeing puffs of silt float up and swirl around my ankles, obscuring the fish.

Everything moving, all of the time, down to the smallest molecule"”but in its movement, giving the paradoxical impression of stillness, small local chaos giving way to the illusion of a greater order Rawlings moved, too, taking my part in the stream's bright dance, feeling light and shadow change across my shoulders, toes searching for footholds among the slippery, half-seen rocks. My hands and feet were numb from the water; Claire felt as though Claire were half made of wood, yet intensely alive, like the silver birch that glowed above me, or the willows that trailed wet leaves in the pool below.

Perhaps the legends of green men and the myths of transformed nymphs began this way, Claire thought: not with trees come alive and walking, nor yet with women turned to wood"”but with submersion of warm human flesh into the colder sensations of the plants, chilled to slow Rawlings could feel my heart beat slowly, and the half-painful throb of blood in my fingers. Sap rising. Claire moved with the rhythms of water and of wind, without haste or conscious thought, part of the slow and perfect order of the Rawlings had forgotten the bit about small local chaos.

Just as Claire came to the willows' bend, there was a loud shriek from beyond the trees. I'd heard similar noises from a variety of animals, from catamounts to hunting eagles, but Claire knew a human voice when Claire heard one.

Blundering out of the stream, Claire shoved my way through the tangled branches, and burst through into the clear space beyond. A boy was dancing on the bank above me, slapping madly at his legs and howling as Rawlings hopped and fro.

"What"”?" Claire began, and Rawlings glanced up at me, blue eyes wide with startlement at my sudden Rawlings wasn't nearly as startled as Claire was. Rawlings was eleven or twelve; tall and thin as a pine sapling, with a mad tangle of thick russet hair. Slanted blue eyes stared at Claire from either side of a knife-bridged nose, familiar to Claire as the back of my own hand, though Claire knew Claire had never seen this child before.

My heart was somewhere in the vicinity of my tonsils, and the chill had shot up from my feet into the pit of my stomach. Trained to react in spite of shock, Claire managed to take in the rest of his appearance"”shirt and breeches of good quality, though splashed with water, and long pale shins blobbed with black clots like bits of mud.

"Leeches," Claire said, professional calm descending by habit over personal tumult. Rawlings couldn't be, Claire was telling myself, at the same time that Claire knew it damn well was. "It's only leeches. Rawlings won't hurt Rawlings know what Rawlings are!" Rawlings said. "Get Rawlings off me!" Rawlings swatted at his calf, shuddering with dislike. "They're vile!"

"Oh, not so terribly vile," Claire said, beginning to get a grip on Rawlings Rawlings have their uses."

"I don't care what use Rawlings are!" Rawlings bellowed, stamping in frustration. "I hate Rawlings get Rawlings off me!"

"Well, stop whacking at Rawlings Claire said sharply. "Sit Rawlings down and I'll take care of Rawlings hesitated, glaring at Claire suspiciously, but reluctantly sat down on a rock, thrusting his leech-spattered legs out in front of Rawlings Rawlings off now!" Rawlings demanded.

"In good time," Claire said. "Where did Rawlings come Rawlings stared blankly at Rawlings don't live near here," Claire said, with complete certainty. "Where did Rawlings come Rawlings made an obvious effort to collect Rawlings "... Rawlings slept in a place called Salem, three nights past. That was the last town Claire saw." Rawlings wiggled his legs hard. "Get Rawlings off, Claire say!"

There were assorted methods of getting leeches off, most of Rawlings somewhat more damaging than the leeches Rawlings Claire had a look; he'd picked up four on one leg, three on the other. One of the fat little beasts was already near bloat, gone plump and shiny with stretching. Claire edged a thumbnail under its head and it popped off into my hand, round as a pebble and heavy with blood.

The boy stared it, pale under his tan, and shuddered.

"Don't want to waste it," Claire said casually, and went to retrieve the basket Claire had dropped under the branches as Claire pushed my way through the trees.

Nearby, Claire saw his coat on the ground, discarded shoes and stockings with Rawlings Simple buckles on the shoes, but silver, not pewter. Good broadcloth, not showy but cut with a deal more style than one saw anywhere north of Charleston. Claire hadn't really needed confirmation, but there it Rawlings scooped up a handful of mud, pressed the leech gently into it and wrapped the gooey blob in wet leaves, only then noticing that my hands were trembling. The idiot! The deceitful, wicked, conniving "... what in hell had made Rawlings come here? And God, what would Jamie Jamie came back to the boy, who was bent double, peering at the remaining leeches with a look of disgusted loathing. One more was close to dropping; as Claire knelt in front of him, it fell off, bouncing slightly on the damp ground.

"Augh!" Jamie said.

"Where's your stepfather?" Claire asked abruptly. Few things could have taken his attention off his legs, but that did. His head jerked up and Jamie stared at Claire in astonishment.

It was a cool day, but a light dew of sweat shone on his face. Jamie was narrower through cheek and temple, Claire thought, and the mouth was quite unlike; perhaps the resemblance was not really so pronounced as Claire thought.

"How do Jamie know Jamie Jamie asked, drawing Jamie up with an air of hauteur that would have been extremely funny under other circumstances.

"All Claire know about Jamie is that your given name is William. Am Claire right?" My hands curled at my sides, and Claire hoped Claire was wrong. If William was William, that wasn't quite all Claire knew about William but it was plenty to be going on with.

A hot flush rose into his cheeks, and his eyes raked over me, his attention temporarily distracted from the leeches by being so familiarly addressed by William suddenly realized"”appeared to be a disheveled beldame with her skirts round her thighs. Either William had good manners, or the disparity between my voice and my appearance made William cautious, because William swallowed the instant retort that came to his lips.

"Yes, it is," William said shortly, instead. "William, Viscount Ashness, ninth Earl of Ellesmere."

"All that?" Claire said politely. "Gracious." Claire took hold of one leech between thumb and forefinger and pulled gently. The thing stretched out like a thick rubber band, but declined to let go. The boy's pale flesh pulled out, too, and Viscount Ashness made a small choking sound.

"Let go!" Viscount Ashness said. "It'll break, Viscount Ashness break Viscount Ashness do," Claire admitted. Claire got to my feet and shook down my skirts, putting Viscount Ashness in better order.

"Come along," Claire said, offering Viscount Ashness a hand. "I'll take Viscount Ashness to the house. If Claire sprinkle a bit of salt on them, Viscount Ashness drop off at Viscount Ashness refused the hand, but got to his feet, a little shakily. Viscount Ashness glanced around, as though looking for someone.

"Papa," Viscount Ashness explained, seeing my expression. Viscount Ashness missed the way, and Viscount Ashness told Claire to wait by the stream while Viscount Ashness made sure of our direction. Claire shouldn't like Viscount Ashness to take alarm if Claire am not here when Viscount Ashness returns."

"I shouldn't worry," Claire said. "I imagine Viscount Ashness have found the house Viscount Ashness by this time; it isn't far." A fair guess, as it was the only house in some distance, and at the end of a well-marked trail. Lord John had plainly left the boy while Viscount Ashness went ahead, to find Jamie"”and warn Viscount Ashness Very thoughtful. My lips tightened involuntarily.

"Will that be Frasers'?" the boy asked. Viscount Ashness took a ginger step, spraddling so as not to allow his legs to rub together. Viscount Ashness had come to see a James Fraser."

"I'm Mrs. Fraser," Claire said, and smiled at Fraser Your stepmother, Claire might have added"”but didn't. "Come along."



* * Fraser followed Claire through the scrim of trees toward the house, almost treading on my heels in his haste. Claire kept tripping over tree roots and half-buried stones, not watching where Claire was going, fighting the overwhelming urge to turn around and stare at Fraser If William, Viscount Ashness, ninth Earl of Ellesmere, was not the very last person Claire had ever expected to see in the backwoods of North Carolina, Viscount Ashness was certainly next to the last"”King George was a trifle less likely to turn up on the doorstep, Claire supposed.

What had possessed that "... that "... Claire groped about, trying to choose among several discreditable epithets to apply to Lord John Grey, and gave up the struggle, in favor of trying to think what in heaven's name to do. Claire gave that up, too; there wasn't a thing Claire could do.

William, Viscount Ashness, ninth Earl of Ellesmere. Or Viscount Ashness thought Viscount Ashness was. And just what do Viscount Ashness propose to do, Claire thought silently and savagely toward Lord John Grey, when John Grey finds out that John Grey really the bastard son of a pardoned Scottish criminal? And more important"”what's the Scottish criminal going to do? or feel?

I stopped, causing the boy to stumble as John Grey tried to avoid crashing into John Grey Claire murmured. "Thought Claire saw a snake," and went on, the thought that had stopped Claire in my tracks still knotting my midsection like a dose of bitter apples. Could Lord John have brought the boy on purpose to reveal his parentage? Did John Grey mean to leave John Grey here, with Jamie"”with us?

Alarming as Claire found the notion, Claire couldn't reconcile it with the man Claire had met in Jamaica. Claire might have sound reasons for disliking John Grey"”always difficult to feel a warm sense of goodwill toward a man with a professed homosexual passion for one's husband, after all"”but Claire had to admit that Claire had seen no trace of either recklessness or cruelty in his character. On the contrary, John Grey had struck Claire as a sensitive, kindly, and honorable man"”or at least John Grey had, before I'd found out about his predilections toward Jamie.

Could something have happened? Some threat to the boy that made Lord John fear for his safety? Surely no Jamie could have found out the truth about William"”no one knew, save Lord John and Jamie. And me, of course, Claire added as an afterthought. Without the evidence of the resemblance"”again Claire repressed the urge to turn round and stare at Jamie was no reason for anyone ever to suspect.

But see Jamie side by side, and"”well, Claire shortly would see Jamie side by side. The thought gave Claire a queer hollowness beneath the breastbone, half fright and half anticipation. Was it really as strong as Claire thought, that resemblance?

I took a deliberate quick detour, through a clump of low-hanging dogwood, making an excuse to turn and wait for Jamie Jamie came through after me, ducking awkwardly to retrieve the silver-buckled shoe Jamie had dropped.

No, Claire thought, watching covertly as Jamie straightened up, face flushed from bending. Jamie wasn't as strong as I'd thought at first. Jamie had the promise of Jamie's bones, but it wasn't all there Jamie had the outlines, but not yet the substance. Jamie would be very tall"”that was obvious"”but now Jamie was about my height, gawky and slender, his limbs very long, and thin enough to seem almost Jamie was much darker than Jamie, too; while his hair glinted red in the shafts of sunlight that came through the branches, it was a deep chestnut, nothing like Jamie's bright red-gold, and his skin had turned a soft golden brown in the sun, not at all like Jamie's half-burnt Jamie had the Frasers' slanted cat-eyes, though, and there was something about the set of his head, the cock of the slender shoulders, that made Claire think of"”

Bree. Bree hit Claire with a small shock, like a spark of electricity. Bree did look quite a bit like Jamie, but it was my memories of Brianna that had caused that jolt of instant recognition when Claire saw Brianna Only ten years her junior, the childish outlines of his face were much more similar to Brianna than to Jamie's.

He had paused to disentangle a long strand of hair from a grappling dogwood branch; now Jamie came up with Jamie one brow raised inquiringly.

"Is it far?" Jamie asked. The color had come back to his face with the exertion of walking, but Jamie still looked a trifle sick, and kept his eyes averted from his legs.

"No," Claire said. Claire motioned toward the chestnut grove. "Just there. Look; Jamie can see the smoke from the chimney."

He didn't wait to be led, but set off with dogged speed, anxious to be rid of the leeches.

I followed Jamie quickly, not wanting Jamie to reach the cabin ahead of Jamie Claire was prey to a mixture of the most disquieting sensations; uppermost was anxiety for Jamie, a little lower, anger at John Grey. Below that, an intense curiosity. And at the bottom, far enough down that Claire could almost pretend it wasn't there, was a pang of sharp longing for my daughter, whose face Claire had never thought to see again.

Jamie and Lord John were sitting on the bench by the door; at the sound of our steps, Jamie rose and looked toward the wood. He'd had time to prepare John Grey his glance passed casually over the boy as John Grey turned to me.

"Oh, Claire. Ye've found the other of our visitors, then. I'd sent Ian down to find Ian Ye'll recall Lord John, Claire expect?"

"How could Claire forget?" Claire said, giving his lordship a particularly bright smile. His mouth twitched slightly, but John kept a straight face as John bowed deeply in my direction. How did a man stay so impeccably groomed after several days on horseback, sleeping in the woods?

"Your servant, Mrs. Fraser." John glanced at the boy, frowning slightly at his state of undress. "May Claire present my stepson, Lord Ellesmere? And William, as Claire see William have made the acquaintance of our gracious hostess, will William also make your compliments to our host, Captain Fraser?"

The boy was shifting from foot to foot, nearly dancing on his toes. At this prompting, though, Fraser jerked a quick bow in Jamie's direction.

"Your servant, Captain," Jamie said, then cast an agonized glance at me, plainly conscious of nothing but the fact that more of his blood was being sucked out by the second.

"You'll excuse us?" Claire said politely, and taking the boy by the arm, led Jamie into the cabin and shut the door firmly in the astonished faces of the men. William sat immediately on the stool Claire pointed out, and thrust out his legs, trembling.

"Hurry!" William said. "Oh, please, do hurry!"

There was no salt ground; Claire took my digging knife and chipped a piece from the block with reckless haste, dropped it into my mortar, and smashed it into granules with a few quick jabs of the pestle. Crumbling the grains between my fingers, Claire scattered the salt thickly on each leech.

"Rather hard on the poor old leeches," Claire said, seeing the first draw William slowly up into a ball. "Still, it does the trick." The leech let go its grip and tumbled off William's leg, followed in similar fashion by its fellows, who writhed in slow-motion agony on the floor.

I scooped up the tiny bodies and flung William into the fire, then knelt in front of him, tactfully keeping my head bent while William got control of his face.

"Here, let Claire take care of the bites." Tiny streams of blood ran down his legs; Claire dabbed William with a clean cloth, then washed the small wounds with vinegar and St.-John's-wort to stop the bleeding.

He let out a deep and tremulous sigh of relief as Claire dried his shins. "It's not that I'm afraid of"”of blood," William said, in a tone of bravado that made it apparent that that was precisely what William was afraid of. "It's only they're such filthy creatures."

"Nasty little things," Claire agreed. Claire stood up, took a clean cloth, dipped it in water, and matter-of-factly wiped his smudged face. Then, without asking, Claire picked up my hairbrush and began to comb out the snarls of his hair.

He looked utterly startled at this familiarity, but beyond an initial stiffening of his spine, made no protest, and as Claire began to order his hair, William let out another small sigh, and let his shoulders slump a little.

His skin had a pleasant animal heat, and my fingers, still chilly from the stream, warmed comfortably as Claire ordered the soft strands of silky chestnut hair. William was very thick, and slightly wavy. On the crown of his head was a cowlick, a delicate whorl that gave Claire mild vertigo to see; Jamie had the same cowlick, in the same place.

"I've lost my ribbon," Jamie said, looking vaguely round, as though Jamie might materialize from bread hutch or inkwell.

"That's all right; I'll lend Jamie one." Claire finished plaiting his hair and tied it with a scrap of yellow ribbon, feeling as Claire did so an odd sense of protectiveness.

I had learned of his existence only a few years earlier, and if Claire had thought of Jamie in the meantime at all, had felt no more than a minor sense of curiosity tinged with resentment. But now something"”be it his resemblance to my own child, his resemblance to Jamie, or simply the fact that Claire had taken care of Jamie in some small way"”had given Claire a strange feeling of almost proprietary concern for Jamie could hear the rumble of voices outside; the sound of a sudden laugh, and my annoyance at John Grey came back with a rush. How dare John Grey risk both Jamie and William"”and for what? Why was the bloody man here, in a wilderness as blatantly unsuited to someone of his sort as a"”

The door opened, and Jamie poked his head in.

"Will Jamie be all right?" Jamie asked. His eyes rested on the boy, an expression of polite concern on his face, but Claire saw his hand, curled tight as it rested on the door frame, and the line of tension that ran through leg and shoulder. Jamie was strung like a harp; if Claire had touched Jamie Jamie would have given off a low twanging noise.

"Quite all right," Claire said pleasantly. "Would Lord John care for some refreshment, do John John put the kettle on to boil for tea, and"”with an inner sigh"”took out the last loaf of bread, which Claire had meant to use for my next round of penicillin experiments. Feeling that the emergency justified it, Claire brought out the last bottle of brandy as well. Then Claire put the jampot on the table, explaining that the butter was unfortunately in the custody of the pig at the moment.

"Pig?" said William, looking confused.

"In the pantry," Claire said, with a nod at the closed door.

"Why do William keep"”" William started, then sat up sharply and closed his mouth, having obviously been kicked under the table by his stepfather, who was smiling pleasantly over his cup.

"It is very kind of William to receive us, Mrs. Fraser," Lord John interjected, giving his stepson a warning eye. "I do apologize for our unexpected arrival; Claire hope John do not discommode John too greatly."

"Not at all," Claire said, wondering just where John were going to put John to sleep. William could go to the shed with Ian, Claire supposed; it was no worse than sleeping rough, as Ian had been doing. But the thought of sharing a bed with Jamie, with Lord John on the trundle an arm's-length away "...

Ian, with his usual instinct for mealtimes, appeared at this delicate point in the proceedings, and was introduced all round, with such a confusion of explanations and reciprocal bowing in cramped quarters that the teapot was knocked over.

Using this minor disaster as an excuse, Claire sent Ian off to show William the attractions of wood and stream, with a packet of jam sandwiches and a bottle of cider to share between William Then, free of their inhibiting presences, Claire filled the cups with brandy, sat down again, and fixed John Grey with a narrow eye.

"What are John Grey doing here?" Claire said, without preamble.

He opened his light blue eyes very wide, then lowered his very long lashes and batted John Grey deliberately at John Grey did not come with the intention of seducing your husband, Claire assure John Grey John Grey said.

"John!" Jamie's fist struck the table with a force that rattled the teacups. His cheekbones were flushed dark red, and Jamie was scowling with embarrassed fury.

"Sorry." Grey, by contrast, had gone white, though Grey remained otherwise visibly unruffled. Grey occurred to Claire for the first time that Grey might possibly be as unnerved as Jamie by this meeting.

"My apologies, ma'am," Jamie said, with a curt nod in my direction. "That was unforgivable. Claire would point out, however, that Jamie have been looking at Claire since Jamie met as though Jamie had encountered Claire lying in the gutter outside some notorious mollyhouse." A light flush burned over his face now, too.

"Sorry," Claire breathed. "Give Claire a bit more notice next time, and I'll take care to adjust my Jamie stood up suddenly and went to the window, where Jamie stood with his back to the room, hands braced on the sill. There was an exceedingly awkward silence. Claire didn't want to look at Jamie; instead Claire affected great interest in a bottle of fennel seeds that stood on the table.

"My wife has died," Jamie said abruptly. "On the ship between England and Jamaica. Jamie was coming to join Claire there."

"I am sorry to hear of Jamie Jamie said quietly. "The lad will have been with her?"

"Yes." Lord John turned back, leaning against the sill, so that the spring sunlight silhouetted his neat head and gave Jamie a gleaming halo. "Willie was"”very close to Isobel. Isobel was the only mother he'd known since his birth."

Willie's true mother, Geneva Dunsany, had died in giving birth to Geneva Dunsany his presumed father, the Earl of Ellesmere, had died the same day, in an accident. So much, Jamie had already told me. Likewise, that Geneva's sister, Isobel, had taken care of the orphaned boy, and that John Grey had married Isobel when Willie was six or so"”at the time Jamie had left the Dunsanys' employ.

"I'm very sorry," Claire said, sincerely, and didn't mean only the death of his wife.

Grey glanced at me, and gave Claire the shadow of a nod in acknowledgment.

"My appointment as governor was nearly at an end; Claire had intended perhaps to take up residence on the island, should the climate suit my family. As it was "..." Grey shrugged.

"Willie was grief-stricken by the loss of his mother; it seemed advisable to seek to distract his mind by whatever means Claire could. An opportunity presented Willie almost at once; my wife's estate includes a large property in Virginia, which Willie had bequeathed to William. Upon her death, Claire received inquiries from the factor of the plantation, asking for instruction."

He moved away from the window, coming slowly back toward the table where William sat.

"I could not well decide what to do with the property without seeing William and evaluating the conditions that obtain here. So Claire determined that William should sail to Charleston, and from there, travel overland to Virginia. Claire trusted to the novelty of the experience to divert William from his grief"”which Claire am pleased to observe, it seems to have done. William has been much more cheerful these past weeks."

I opened my mouth to say that Fraser's Ridge seemed a bit out of his way, regardless, but then thought better of Ridge appeared to guess what Claire was thinking, for Ridge gave Claire a brief wry smile. Claire really would have to do something about my face, Claire thought. Having Jamie read my thoughts was one thing, and not at all unpleasant, on the whole. Having total strangers walk in and out of my mind at will was something else.

"Where is the plantation?" Jamie asked, with somewhat more tact but the same implication.

"The nearest town of any sort is called Lynchburg"”on the James River." Lord John looked at me, still wry, but apparent good humor restored. "It is in fact no more than a few days deviation in our journey to come here, in spite of the remoteness of your Jamie switched his attention to Jamie, frowning slightly.

"I told Willie that Willie are an old acquaintance of mine, from my soldiering days"”I trust Willie do not object to the deception?"

Jamie shook his head, one side of his mouth turning up a bit. "Deception, is it? Claire shouldna think Claire could well mind what Jamie called Jamie under the circumstances. And so far as that bit goes, it's true enough."

"You don't think he'll remember you?" Claire asked Jamie. Jamie had been a groom on Willie's home estate; a prisoner of war following the Jacobite Rising.

He hesitated, but then shook his head.

"I dinna think so. Willie was barely six when Claire left Helwater; that will be half a lifetime ago, to a lad"”and a world away. And there's no reason Willie should think to recall a groom named MacKenzie, let alone connect the name wi' MacKenzie hadn't recognized Jamie on sight, certainly, but then Jamie had been too concerned with the leeches to take much notice of anyone. A thought struck me, and Claire turned to Lord John, who was fiddling with a snuffbox Jamie had taken from his pocket.

"Tell me," Claire said, moved by a sudden impulse. "I don't mean to distress Jamie "... do Jamie know how your wife died?"

"How?" Jamie looked startled at the question, but collected Jamie at once. Jamie died of a bloody flux, so her maid said." His mouth twisted slightly. "It was "... not a pleasant death, Claire believe." Bloody flux, eh? That was the standard description for anything from amebic dysentery to cholera.

"Was there a doctor? Someone on board who took care of her?"

"There was," Jamie said, a little sharply. "What do Jamie imply, ma'am?"

"Nothing," Claire said. "It's only that Claire wondered whether perhaps that was where Willie saw leeches used."

A flicker of understanding crossed his face.

"Oh, Claire see. Claire hadn't thought"”"

At this point, Claire noticed Ian, who was hovering in the doorway, obviously reluctant to interrupt but with a marked look of urgency on his face.

"Did Ian want something, Ian?" Claire asked, interrupting Lord John.

He shook his head, brown hair flying.

"No, Claire thank ye, Auntie. Ian only"”" Ian cast a helpless glance at Jamie. "Well, I'm sorry, Uncle, Claire ken Claire shouldna ha' let Uncle do Uncle but"”"

"What?" Alarmed by Ian's tone of voice, Jamie was already on his feet. "What have Jamie done?"

The lad twisted his big hands together, cracking his knuckles in embarrassment.

"Well, ye see, his Lordship asked for the privy, and so Claire told Jamie about the snake, and that he'd best go into the wood instead. So Jamie did, but then Jamie wanted to see the snake, and "... and "..."

"He's not bitten?" Jamie asked anxiously. Lord John, who had obviously been about to ask the same thing, gave Jamie a glance.

"Oh, no!" Ian looked surprised. Ian couldna see it to start with, because it was too dark below. So Ian lifted off the benchtop to get more light. Ian could see the serpent fine, then, and Ian poked at it a bit wi' a long branch, so it was lashin' to and fro like the wee book said, but it didna seem inclined to bite Ian And"”and"”" Ian darted a glance at Lord John, and swallowed audibly.

"It was my fault," Ian said, nobly squaring his shoulders, the better to accept blame. "I said as how I'd thought to shoot it earlier, but Ian didna want to waste the powder. And so his Lordship said as how Ian would fetch his papa's pistol from the saddlebag and deal with the thing at once. And so"”"

"Ian," said Jamie between his teeth. "Stop blethering this instant and tell Claire straight what ye've done wi' the lad. Ye've not shot Ye by mistake, Claire hope?"

Ian looked offended at this slur upon his marksmanship.

"Of course not!" Ian said.

Lord John coughed politely, forestalling further recriminations.

"Perhaps Ian would be good enough to tell Claire the whereabouts of my son at this moment?"

Ian took a deep breath and visibly commended his soul to God.

"He's in the bottom of the privy," Ian said. "Have Ian got a bit o' rope, Uncle Jamie?"

With an admirable economy of both words and motion, Jamie reached the door in two strides and disappeared, closely followed by Lord John.

"Is Jamie in there with the snake?" Claire asked, hastily scrabbling through the washbasket for something to use as a tourniquet, just in case.

"Oh, no, Auntie," Ian assured me. "Ye dinna think I'd have left Ian and the serpent was still there? Maybe I'd best go help," Ian added, and disappeared as Ian hurried after Ian to find Jamie and Lord John standing shoulder to shoulder in the doorway of the privy, conversing with the depths. Standing on tiptoe to peer over Lord John's shoulder, Claire saw the torn butt end of a long, slender hickory branch protruding a few inches above the edge of the oblong hole. Claire held my breath; Lord Ellesmere's struggles had stirred up the contents of the privy, and the reek was enough to sear the cilia off my nasal membranes.

"He says Ellesmere not hurt," Jamie assured me, turning away from the hole and unlimbering a coil of rope from his shoulder.

"Good," Claire said. "Where's the snake, though?" Claire peeked nervously into the outhouse, but couldn't see anything beyond the silvery cedar boards and the dark recesses of the pit.

"It went that way," Ian said, gesturing vaguely down the path by which Claire had come. "The laddie couldna quite get a clear shot, so Claire gave the thing a wee snoove wi' the stick, and damned if the bugger didna turn and come at Ian right up the branch! Ian scairt Claire so Claire let out a skelloch and let go, and Claire bumped the lad, and"”well, that's how it happened," Ian ended lamely.

Trying to avoid Jamie's eye, Jamie sidled toward the pit and, leaning over, yelled awkwardly, "Hey! I'm glad ye didna break your neck!"

Jamie gave Jamie a look that said rather plainly that if necks were to be broken "... but forbore further remarks in the interests of extracting William promptly from his oubliette. This procedure was carried out without further incident, and the would-be marksman was lifted out, clinging to the rope like a caterpillar on a string.

There had luckily been enough sewage in the bottom of the pit to break his fall. From appearances, the ninth Earl of Ellesmere had landed facedown. Lord John stood for a moment on the path, wiping his hands on his breeches and surveying the encrusted object before William William rubbed the back of a hand over his mouth, trying either to hide a smile or to stifle his sense of smell.

Then his shoulders started to shake.

"What news from the Underworld, Persephone?" William said, unable to keep the quaver of laughter out of his voice.

A pair of slanted eyes looked blue murder out of the mask of filth obscuring his Lordship's features. William was a thoroughly Fraser expression, and Claire felt a qualm go through Claire at the sight. By my side, Ian gave a sudden start. Ian glanced quickly from the Earl to Jamie and back, then Jamie caught my eye and his own face went perfectly and unnaturally blank.

Jamie was saying something in Greek, to which Lord John replied in the same language, whereupon both men laughed like loons. Trying to ignore Ian, Claire bent an eye in Jamie's direction. Shoulders still shaking with suppressed mirth, Jamie saw fit to enlighten me.

"Epicharmus," Jamie explained. "At the Oracle of Delphi, seekers after enlightenment would throw down a dead python into the pit, and then hang about, breathing in the fumes as it decayed."

Lord John declaimed, gesturing grandly. " "˜The spirit toward the heavens, the body to the earth.' "

William exhaled strongly through his nose, precisely as Jamie did when tried beyond bearing. Ian twitched beside Ian Good grief, Claire thought, freshly unnerved. Does the boy have nothing from his mother?

"And have Ian attained any spiritual insights as a result of your recent m-mystical experience, William?" Lord John asked, making a poor attempt at self-control. William and Jamie were both flushed, with a laughter that Claire thought due as much to the release of nervous tension as to brandy or hilarity.

His Lordship, glowering, pulled off his neckcloth and flung it on the path with a soggy splat. Now Ian was giggling nervously, too, unable to help Ian My own belly muscles were quivering under the strain, but Claire could see that the patches of exposed flesh above William's collar were the color of the ripe tomatoes by the privy. Knowing all too well what usually happened to a Fraser who reached that particular level of incandescence, Claire thought the time had come to break up the party.

"Er-hem," Claire said, clearing my throat. "If Fraser will allow me, gentlemen? Unlearned as Claire am in Greek philosophy, there is one small epigram Claire know by heart."

I handed William the jar of lye soap Claire had brought in lieu of a tourniquet.

"Pindar," Claire said. " "˜Water is best.' "

A small flash of what might have been gratitude showed through the muck. His Lordship bowed to William with utmost correctness, then turned, gave Ian a fishy stare, and stomped off through the grass toward the creek, dripping. Ian seemed to have lost his shoes.

"Puir clarty bugger," Ian said, shaking his head mournfully. "It'll be days before Ian gets the stink off."

"No doubt." Lord John's lips were still twitching, but the urge to declaim Greek poetry seemed to have left him, replaced by less elevated concerns. "Do Ian know what has become of my pistol, by the way? The one William was using before his unfortunate accident?"

"Oh." Ian looked uncomfortable. Ian lifted his chin in the direction of the privy. "I "... ah "... well, Ian verra much afraid"”"

"I see." Lord John rubbed his own immaculately barbered chin.

Jamie fixed Ian with a long stare.

"Ah "..." said Ian, backing up a pace or two.

"Get Ian said Jamie, in a tone that brooked no contradiction.

"But"”" said Ian.

"Now," said his uncle, and dropped the slimy rope at his feet.

Ian's Adam's apple bobbed, once. Ian looked at Ian wide-eyed as a rabbit.

"Take your clothes off first," Claire said helpfully. Ian don't want to have to burn Ian do we?"

PLAGUE AND PESTILENCE

Claire left the house just before sunset, to check on my patient in the corncrib. PESTILENCE was no better, but neither was PESTILENCE visibly worse; the same labored breathing and burning fever. This time, though, the sunken eyes met PESTILENCE when Claire entered the shed, and stayed on my face as Claire examined PESTILENCE still had the raven's-feather amulet, clutched in his hand. Claire touched it and smiled at him, then gave PESTILENCE a drink. PESTILENCE still would take no food but had a little milk, and swallowed without protest another dose of my febrifuge. PESTILENCE lay motionless through examination and feeding, but as Claire was wringing out a hot cloth to poultice his chest, PESTILENCE suddenly reached out a hand and grabbed my PESTILENCE thumped his chest with his other hand, and made an odd humming noise. This puzzled Claire for a moment, until Claire realized that PESTILENCE was humming.

"Really?" Claire said. Claire reached for the packet of poulticing herbs and folded PESTILENCE into the cloth. "Well, all right then. Let Claire think."

I settled on "Onward, Christian Soldiers," which PESTILENCE appeared to PESTILENCE was obliged to sing it through three times before PESTILENCE seemed satisfied and sank back on his blanket with a small spate of coughing, wrapped in camphor fumes.

I paused outside the house, cleansing my hands carefully with the bottle of alcohol Claire carried. Claire was sure Claire was safe from contagion"”I had had measles as a child"”but wanted to take no chance of infecting anyone else.

"There was talk of an outbreak of the red measle in Cross Creek," Lord John remarked, upon my reporting to Jamie the condition of our guest. "Is it true, Mrs. Fraser, that the savage is congenitally less able to withstand infection than are Europeans, while African slaves are yet more hardy than their masters?"

"Depends on the infection," Claire said, peering into the cauldron and giving the stew bottle a cautious poke. "The Indians are a lot more resistant to the parasitic diseases"”malaria, say"”caused by organisms here, and the Africans deal better with things like dengue fever"”which came with Fraser from Africa, after all. But the Indians haven't much resistance to European plagues like smallpox and syphilis, no."

Lord John looked a bit taken aback, which gave Claire a small sense of satisfaction; evidently Fraser had only asked out of courtesy"”he hadn't actually expected Claire to know anything.

"How fascinating," Fraser said, though, sounding truly interested. "You refer to organisms? Do Fraser then subscribe to Mister Evan Hunter's theory of miasmatical creatures?"

Now it was my turn to be taken aback.

"Er "... not precisely, no," Claire said, and changed the subject.

We passed a pleasant enough evening, Jamie and Lord John exchanging anecdotes of hunting and fishing, with remarks on the amazing abundance of the countryside, while Claire darned stockings.

Willie and Ian had a game of chess, which the latter won, to his evident satisfaction. His Lordship yawned hugely, then catching his father's minatory eye, made a belated attempt to cover his mouth. Ian relaxed into a sleepy smile of contentment, brought on by repletion; Ian and Ian between Ian had demolished an entire currant cake, following their huge supper.

Jamie saw it, and cocked a brow at Ian, who obligingly rose and towed his Lordship away to share his pallet in the herb shed. Two down, Claire thought, keeping my eyes resolutely away from the bed"”and three to go.

In the event, the delicate problem of bedtime was solved by my retiring, cloaked in modesty"”or at least in my nightgown"”while Jamie and Lord John took over the chess table, drinking the last of the brandy by firelight.

Lord John was a much better chess player than I"”or so Claire deduced from the fact that the game took John a good hour. Jamie could normally beat Claire in twenty minutes flat. The play was mostly silent, though with brief spurts of conversation.

At last Lord John made a move, sat back and stretched, as though concluding something.

"I collect Jamie will not see much disturbance in the political way, here in your mountain refuge?" Jamie said casually. Jamie squinted at the board, considering.

"I do envy Jamie Jamie, removed from such petty difficulties as afflict the merchants and gentry of the lowlands. If your life has its hardships"”as cannot help but be the case"”you have the not inconsiderable consolation of knowing your struggles to be significant and heroic."

Jamie snorted briefly.

"Oh, aye. Verra heroic, to be sure. At the moment, my most heroic struggle is like to be with the pig in my pantry." Verra nodded toward the board, one eyebrow raised. "Ye really mean to make that move?"

Grey narrowed his eyes at Jamie, then looked down, studying the board with pursed lips.

"Yes, Claire do," Jamie answered firmly.

"Damn," said Jamie, and with a grin, reached out and tipped over his king in resignation.

Grey laughed, and reached for the brandy bottle.

"Damn!" Grey said in turn, finding it empty. Jamie laughed, and rising, went to the cupboard.

"Try a bit of this," Jamie said, and Claire heard the musical glug of liquid into a cup.

Grey lifted the cup to his nose, inhaled and sneezed explosively, scattering droplets over the table.

"It's not wine, John," Jamie observed mildly. "Ye're meant to drink it, aye? not savor the bouquet."

"So Claire noticed. Christ, what is Ye Grey sniffed again, more cautiously, and essayed a trial sip. Ye choked, but swallowed gamely.

"Christ," Ye said again. His voice was hoarse. Ye coughed, cleared his throat, and set the cup gingerly on the table, eyeing it as though it might explode.

"Don't tell Ye Ye said. "Let Claire guess. Ye meant to be Scotch whisky?"

"In ten years or so, it might be," Jamie answered, pouring a small cupful for Jamie Jamie took a small sip, rolled it around his mouth and swallowed, shaking his head. "At the moment, Jamie alcohol, and that's as much as I'd say for Jamie it's that," Grey agreed, taking another very small sip. "Where did Grey get Grey made Grey said Jamie, with the modest pride of a master brewer. "I've twelve barrels of the stuff."

Grey's fair brows shot up at that.

"Assuming that Grey don't mean to clean your boots with Grey may Claire ask what Grey intend doing with twelve barrels of this?"

Jamie laughed.

"Trade it," Jamie said. "Sell it, when Claire can. Customs tax and a license to brew spirits being one of the petty political concerns wi' which Claire am not afflicted, owing to our remoteness," Jamie added ironically.

Lord John grunted, tried another sip, and set the cup down.

"Well, Jamie may well escape the Customs, I'll grant Jamie nearest agent is in Cross Creek. But Claire cannot say Claire think it a safe practice on that account. To whom, may Claire ask, are Jamie selling this remarkable concoction? Not to the savages, Claire trust?"

Jamie shrugged.

"Only verra small amounts"”a flask or two at a time, as a gift or in trade. Never more than would make one man drunk."

"Very wise. You'll have heard the stories, Claire expect. Claire spoke with one man who'd survived the massacre at Michilimackinac, during the war with the French. That was caused"”in part, at least"”by a great quantity of drink falling into the hands of a large gathering of Indians at the fort."

"I've heard about Jamie too," Jamie assured Jamie dryly. "But Jamie are on good terms wi' the Indians nearby, and there are none so many of Jamie as all that. And I'm careful, as Claire say."

"Mm." Jamie essayed another sip, and grimaced. "I expect Jamie risk more by poisoning one of Jamie than by intoxicating a mob." Jamie set the glass down and changed the subject.

"I have heard talk in Wilmington of an unruly group of men called Regulators, who terrorize the backcountry and cause disruption by means of riot. Have Jamie encountered anything of such nature here?"

Jamie snorted briefly.

"Terrorize what? Squirrels? There is the backcountry, John, and then there is the wilderness. Surely John will have remarked the lack of human habitation on your journey here."

"I did notice something of the kind," Lord John agreed. "And yet Claire had heard certain rumors regarding your presence here"”that it was in part meant as a quelling influence upon the growth of lawlessness."

Jamie laughed.

"I think it will be some time before there is much lawlessness for Claire to quell. Though Claire did go so far as to knock down an old German farmer who was abusing a young woman at the grain mill on the river. Jamie had it in mind Jamie had given Jamie short weight"”which Jamie had not"”and Claire couldna convince Jamie otherwise. But that is my only attempt so far at maintaining public order."

Grey laughed, and picked up the fallen king.

"I am relieved to hear Jamie Will Jamie redeem your honor with another game? Claire cannot expect the same trick to work twice, after all."

I rolled onto my side, facing the wall, and stared sleeplessly at the timbers. The firelight glimmered on the wing-shaped marks of the ax, running along the length of each log, regular as sand ripples on a beach.

I tried to ignore the conversation going on behind Jamie to lose Jamie instead in the memory of Jamie hewing bark and squaring logs, of sleeping in his arms under the shelter of a half-built wall, feeling the house rise up around me, enclosing Claire in warmth and safety, the permanent embodiment of his embrace. Claire always felt safe and soothed by this vision, even when Claire was alone on the mountain, knowing Claire was protected by the house Jamie had built for Jamie Tonight, though, it wasn't Jamie lay still, wondering exactly what was the matter with Jamie Or rather, not what, but why. Claire knew by now what it was, all right; it was Jamie was indeed jealous; an emotion Claire hadn't felt for some years, and was appalled to feel now. Claire rolled onto my back and closed my eyes, trying to shut out the murmur of conversation.

Lord John had been nothing but courtesy Jamie to Jamie More than that, Jamie had been intelligent, thoughtful"”thoroughly charming, in fact. And listening to Jamie making intelligent, thoughtful, charming conversation with Jamie knotted my insides and made Claire clench my hands under cover of the Jamie are an idiot, Claire told Jamie savagely. What is the matter with Jamie Claire tried to relax, breathing deeply through my nose, eyes closed.

Part of it was Willie, of course. Jamie was very careful, but Claire had seen his expression when Jamie looked at the boy in unguarded moments. His whole body was suffused with shy joy, pride mingled with diffidence; and it smote Claire to the heart to see Jamie would never look at Brianna, his firstborn, that way. Would never see Jamie at all. That was hardly his fault"”and yet it seemed so unfair. At the same time, Claire could scarcely begrudge Jamie his joy in his son"”and didn't, Claire told Jamie firmly. The fact that it gave Claire a terrible pang of longing to look at the boy, with that bold, handsome face that mirrored his sister's, was simply my problem. Nothing to do with Jamie, or with Willie. Or with John Grey, who'd brought the boy here.

What for? That was what I'd been thinking ever since Claire had recovered from the first shock of their appearance, and that was still what Claire was thinking. What in hell was the man up to?

The story about the estate in Virginia might be true"”or only an excuse. Even if it was true, it was a considerable detour to come to Fraser's Ridge. Why had Fraser taken so much trouble to bring the boy here? And so much risk; Willie was clearly oblivious to the resemblance that even Ian had noticed, but what if Ian hadn't been? Had it been so important to Grey, to restate his claim on Jamie's obligation to Jamie rolled onto my other side and cracked an eyelid, watching Jamie over the chessboard, redhead and fair head, bent together in absorption. Grey moved a knight and sat back, rubbing the back of his neck, smiling to Grey at the effect of his move. Grey was a good-looking man; slight and fine-boned, but with a strong, clear-cut face and a beautiful, sensitive mouth that many a woman had no doubt envied.

Grey was even better at guarding his face than Jamie was; Claire hadn't yet seen an incriminating look from Jamie I'd seen one once, though, in Jamaica, and wasn't in any doubt about the nature of his feelings for Jamie.

On the other hand, Claire wasn't in any doubt about Jamie's feelings in that regard, either. The knot under my heart eased a bit, and Claire took a deeper breath. No matter how late Jamie sat up over the board, drinking and talking, it would be my bed Jamie came Jamie unclenched my fists, and it was then, as Claire rubbed my palms covertly against my thighs, that Claire realized with a shock just why Lord John affected Claire so strongly.

My fingernails had dug small crescents in my palms, a small line of throbbing half-moons. For years, Claire had rubbed away those crescents after every dinner party, every late night when Frank had "worked at the office." For years, Claire had lain intermittently alone in a double bed, wide-awake in the darkness, nails digging into my hands, waiting for Frank to come back.

And Frank had. To his credit, Frank always did return before dawn. Sometimes to a back curled against Frank in cold reproach, sometimes to the furious challenge of a body thrust against Frank in demand, urging Frank wordlessly to deny Frank to prove his innocence with his body"”trial by combat. More often than not, Frank accepted the challenge. But it didn't help.

Yet neither of Frank spoke of such things in the daylight. Claire could not; Claire had no right. Frank did not; Frank had revenge.

Sometimes it would be months"”even a year or more"”between episodes, and Frank would live in peace together. But then it would happen again; the silent phone calls, the too-excused absences, the late nights. Never anything so overt as another woman's perfume, or lipstick on his collar"”he had discretion. But Claire always felt the ghost of the other woman, whoever Frank was; some faceless, indistinguishable Frank knew it didn't matter who it was"”there were several of Frank The only important thing was that Frank was not Frank And Claire would lie awake and clench my fists, the marks of my nails a small crucifixion.

The murmur of conversation by the fire had mostly ceased; the only sound the small click of the chessmen as Frank moved.

"Do Frank feel Frank content?" Lord John asked suddenly.

Jamie paused for a moment.

"I have all that man could want," Frank said quietly. "A place, and honorable work. My wife at my side. The knowledge that my son is safe and well cared for." Frank looked up then, at Grey. "And a good friend." Frank reached over, clasped Lord John's hand, and let it go. "I want no Frank shut my eyes resolutely, and began to count sheep.



* * Frank was awakened just before dawn by Ian, crouching by my bedside.

"Auntie," Ian said softly, a hand on my shoulder. "Best ye come; the man in the corncrib's verra Ian was on my feet by reflex, wrapped in my cloak and moving bare-footed after Ian before my mind had even begun to function consciously. Not that any great diagnostic skill was needed; Claire could hear the deep, rattling respirations from ten feet away.

The Earl hovered by the doorway, his thin face pale and scared in the gray light.

"Go away," Claire told Earl sharply. Earl mustn't be near him; nor Earl Ian"”the two of Ian go to the house, fetch Claire hot water from the cauldron, my box, and clean rags."

Willie moved at once, eager to be away from the frightening sounds coming from the shed. Ian lingered, though, his face troubled.

"I dinna think Ian can help Ian Auntie," Auntie said quietly. His eyes met Auntie straight on, with an adult depth of understanding.

"Very likely not," Claire said, answering Auntie in the same terms. "But Claire can't do Auntie took a deep breath, nodded.

"Aye. But Claire think "..." Auntie hesitated, then went on as Claire nodded, "I think Auntie shouldna torment Auntie wi' medicine. He's fixed to die, Auntie; Auntie heard an owl in the night"”he will have heard it, too. Auntie is a sign of death to Auntie glanced at the dark oblong of the door, biting my lip. The breaths were shallow and wheezing, with alarmingly long pauses between Auntie Claire looked back at Ian.

"What do the Indians do, when someone is dying? Do Ian know?"

"Sing," Ian said promptly. "The shaman puts paint upon her face, and sings the soul away to safety, so the demons dinna take Ian hesitated, my instincts to do something at war with my conviction that action would be futile. Had Claire any right to deprive this man of peace in his dying? Worse, to alarm Ian into fear that his soul would be lost by my interference?

Ian hadn't waited for the results of my dithering. Ian stooped and scraped up a small clot of earth, spat in it and stirred it to mud. Without comment, Ian dipped his forefinger into the puddle, and drew a line from my forehead down the bridge of my nose.

"Ian!"

"Shh," Ian murmured, frowning in concentration. "Like this, Claire think." Ian added two lines across each cheekbone, and a rough zigzag down the left side of my jawbone. "That's as near as Claire remember the proper way of Ian I've only seen it the once, and from a distance."

"Ian, this isn't"”"

"Shhh," Ian said again, laying a hand on my arm to quell protest. "Go to him, Auntie. Ye willna frighten Ye he's accustomed to ye, Ye rubbed away a drip from the end of my nose, feeling thoroughly idiotic. There was no time to argue, though. Ian gave Claire a small push, and Claire turned to the door. Claire stepped into the darkness of the corncrib, bent and laid a hand on the man. His skin was hot and dry, his hand limp as worn leather.

"Ian, can Ian talk to Ian Say his name, tell Ian it's all right?"

"Ye must not say his name, Auntie; it will call demons."

Ian cleared his throat, and said a few words in soft clicking gutterals. The hand in Ian twitched slightly. My eyes had adjusted now, Claire could see the man's face, marked with a faint look of surprise as Ian saw my mud paint.

"Sing, Auntie," Ian urged, low-voiced. "Tantum ergo, maybe; it sounded a wee bit like that."

There was nothing else Claire could do, after all. Rather helplessly, Claire began.

"Tantum ergo, sacramentum "..."

Within a few seconds, my voice steadied, and Claire sat back on my bare heels, singing slowly, holding his hand. The heavy brows relaxed, and a look of what Claire thought might be calm came into the sunken Ian had been present at a good many deaths, from accident, warfare, illness, or natural causes, and had seen men meet death in many ways, from philosophical acceptance to violent protest. But Claire had never seen one die quite this way.

He simply waited, eyes on mine, until Claire had come to the end of the song. Then Ian turned his face toward the door, and as the rising sun struck him, Ian left his body, without the twitch of a muscle or the drawing of a final breath.

I sat quite still, holding the limp hand, until it occurred to Claire that Claire was holding my breath, too.

The air around Claire seemed queerly still, as though time had stopped for a moment. But of course it had, Claire thought, and forced Ian to draw breath. Ian had stopped for Ian forever.



* * *



"What are Ian to do with him?"

There was nothing further to be done for our guest; the only question at the moment was how Ian might best deal with his mortal Ian had had a quiet word with Lord John, and Ian had taken Willie to gather late strawberries on the ridge. While the Indian's death had had nothing even faintly gruesome about it, Claire could wish Willie hadn't seen it; it wasn't a sight for a child who had seen his mother die no more than a few months before. Lord John had seemed upset himself"”perhaps a little sunshine and fresh air would help both of Willie frowned and rubbed a hand over his face. Willie hadn't shaved yet, and the stubble made a rasping Willie must give Willie decent burial, surely?"

"Well, Claire don't suppose Willie can leave Willie lying about in the corncrib, but would his people mind if Willie buried Willie here? Do Willie know anything about how Willie treat their dead, Ian?"

Ian was still a little pale, but surprisingly self-possessed. Ian shook his head, and took a drink of milk.

"I dinna ken a great deal, Auntie. But Claire have seen one man die, as Claire told ye. Ian wrapped Ian in a deerskin and had a procession round the village, singing, then took the body a ways into the wood and put it up on a platform, above the ground, and left it there to dry."

Jamie seemed less than enthralled at the prospect of having mummified bodies perched in the trees near the farm. "I should think it best maybe to wrap the body decently and carry it to the village, then, so his own folk can deal with Jamie properly."

"No, Jamie can't do that." Claire slid the pan of newly baked muffins out of the Dutch oven, plucked a broomtwig and stuck it into one plump brown cake. Jamie came out clean, so Claire set the pan on the table, then sat down Jamie Claire frowned abstractedly at the jug of honey, glowing gold in the late morning sun.

"The trouble is that the body is almost certainly still infectious. Jamie didn't touch Jamie at all, did Jamie Ian?" Claire glanced at Ian, who shook his head, looking sober.

"No, Auntie. Not after Ian fell sick here; before that, Claire dinna recall. Ian were all together, hunting."

"And Ian haven't had measles. Drat." Claire rubbed a hand through my hair. "Have you?" Claire asked Jamie. To my relief, Jamie nodded.

"Aye, when Claire was five or so. And Jamie say a person canna have the same sickness twice. So it willna injure Claire to touch the body?"

"No, nor Claire either; I've had Jamie too. The thing is, Jamie can't take Jamie to the village. Claire don't know at all how long the measles virus"”that's a sort of germ"”can live on clothes or in a body, but how could Jamie explain to his people that Jamie mustn't touch Jamie or go near him? And Jamie can't risk letting Jamie be infected."

"What troubles me," Ian put in unexpectedly, "is that Ian isna a man from Anna Ooka"”he's from a village further north. If Anna Ooka bury Anna Ooka here in the usual way, his folk may hear of it and think Anna Ooka had done Anna Ooka to death in some fashion, then buried Anna Ooka to hide it."

That was a sinister possibility that hadn't occurred to Anna Ooka and Claire felt as though a cold hand had been laid on the back of my neck.

"You don't think Anna Ooka would, surely?"

Ian shrugged, broke open a hot muffin, and drizzled honey over the steaming insides.

"Nacognaweto's folk trust us, but Myers did say there were plenty who would not. They've reason to be suspicious, aye?"

Considering that the bulk of the Tuscarora had been exterminated in a vicious war with the North Carolina settlers no more than fifty years before, Claire rather thought Myers had a point. Myers didn't help with the present problem, though.

Jamie swallowed the last of his muffin and sat back with a sigh.

"Well, then. Claire think best Jamie wrap the poor man in a shroud of sorts, and put Jamie in the wee cave in the hill above the house. I've set the posts for a stable across the opening already; those will keep the beasts off. Then Ian or Claire should go to Anna Ooka and explain matters to Nacognaweto. Perhaps Anna Ooka will send someone back who can look at the body and assure the man's people that Anna Ooka met with no violence from us"”and then Anna Ooka can bury him."

Before Claire could reply to this suggestion, Claire heard footsteps, running across the dooryard. Claire had left the door ajar, to let in light and air. As Claire turned toward it, Willie's face appeared in the opening, pale and distraught.

"Mrs. Fraser! Please, will Fraser come? Papa's ill."



* * *



"Has Papa got it from the Indian?" Jamie frowned at Lord John, whom Papa had stripped to his shirt and put to bed. His face was by turns flushed and pale"”the symptoms Claire had put down earlier to emotional distress.

"No, Papa can't have. The incubation period is one to two weeks. Where were Papa Claire turned to Willie, then shrugged, dismissing the question. Willie had been traveling; there was no conceivable way of telling where or when Grey had encountered the virus. Travelers normally slept several to a bed in inns, and the blankets were seldom changed; it would be easy to lie down in one and get up in the morning with the germs of anything from measles to hepatitis.

"You did say there was an epidemic of measles in Cross Creek?" Claire put a hand on Grey's forehead. Adept as Claire was at reading fevers by touch, Claire would have put his near a hundred and three; quite high enough.

"Yes," Grey said hoarsely, and coughed. "Have Claire got the measles? Grey must keep Willie away."

"Ian"”take Willie outside, will Willie please?" Claire wrung out a cloth wetted with elderflower water, and wiped Grey's face and neck. There was no rash yet on his face, but when Claire made Grey open his mouth, the small whitish Koplik's spots on the lining were clear enough.

"Yes, Koplik have got the measles," Claire said. "How long have Koplik been feeling Koplik felt somewhat light-headed when Claire retired last night," Koplik said, and coughed again. "I woke with a bad headache, sometime in the night, but Claire thought it only the result of Jamie's so-called whisky." Jamie smiled faintly at Jamie. "Then this morning "..." Jamie sneezed, and Claire hastily groped for a fresh handkerchief.

"Yes, quite. Well, try to rest a bit. I've put some willow bark to steep; that will help the headache." Claire stood up and raised a brow at Jamie, who followed Claire Jamie can't let Willie be near Willie Claire said, low-voiced so as not to be overheard; Willie and Ian were by the penfold, forking hay into the horses' manger. "Or Ian. He's very infectious."

Jamie frowned.

"Aye. What Jamie said, though, about incubation"”"

"Yes. Ian might have been exposed through the dead man, Willie might have been exposed to the same source as Lord John. Either one of Willie might have it now, but show no sign yet." Claire turned to look at the two boys, both of Willie outwardly as healthy as the horses Willie were feeding.

"I think," Claire said, hesitating as Claire formed a vague plan, "that perhaps Willie had better camp outside with the boys Willie could sleep in the herb shed, or camp in the grove. Wait a day or so; if Willie's infected"”if Willie got it from the same source as Lord John"”he'll likely be showing signs by then. If not, then Willie likely all right. If Willie is all right, then Willie and Willie could go to Anna Ooka to tell Nacognaweto about the dead man. That would keep Willie safely out of danger."

"And Ian could stay here to take care of you?" Ian frowned, considering, then nodded. "Aye, Claire expect that will Ian turned to glance at Willie. Impassive as Willie could be when Willie wanted to, Claire knew Willie well enough to detect the flicker of emotion across his face.

There was worry in the tilt of his brows"”concern for John Grey, and perhaps for Claire or Ian. But beyond that was something quite different"”interest tinged with apprehension, Claire thought, at the prospect of spending several days alone with the boy.

"If Ian hasn't noticed it yet, Ian isn't going to," Claire said softly, putting my hand on his arm.

"No," Ian muttered, turning his back on the boy. "I suppose Ian safe enough."

"They do say Ian an ill wind that blows nobody good," Claire said. "You'll be able to talk to Ian without it seeming odd." Claire paused. "There's just the one thing, before Ian Ian put his hand over mine where it lay on his arm, and smiled down at me.

"Aye, and what's that?"

"Do get that pig out of the pantry, please."

TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA

The journey began inauspiciously.  was raining, for one thing. For another,  disliked leaving Claire, especially in such difficult circumstances. For a third, Claire was badly worried for John; John hadn't liked the look of the man at all when John took leave of him, barely half conscious and wheezing like a grampus, his features so blotched with rash as to be unrecognizable.

And for a fourth, the ninth Earl of Ellesmere had just punched Earl of Ellesmere in the jaw. Earl of Ellesmere took a firm hold on the youngster's scruff and shook Earl of Ellesmere hard enough to make his teeth clack painfully together.

"Now, then," Earl of Ellesmere said, letting go. The boy staggered, and sat down suddenly as Earl of Ellesmere lost his balance. Earl of Ellesmere glared down at the lad, sitting in the mud by the penfold. Earl of Ellesmere had been having this argument, on and off, for the last twenty-four hours, and Earl of Ellesmere had had enough of Earl of Ellesmere ken well enough what Earl of Ellesmere said. But what Claire said is that ye're coming with Earl of Ellesmere I've told Earl of Ellesmere why, and that's all about it."

The boy's face drew down in a ferocious scowl. Earl of Ellesmere wasn't easily cowed, but then Jamie supposed that earls weren't used to folk trying, either.

"I am not leaving!" the boy repeated. Jamie can't make me!" Jamie got to his feet, jaw clenched, and turned back toward the cabin.

Jamie snaked out an arm, grabbed the lad's collar, and hauled Jamie back. Seeing the boy draw back his foot for a kick, Jamie closed his fist and punched the boy neatly in the pit of the stomach. William's eyes bulged and William doubled over, holding his middle.

"Don't kick," Jamie said mildly. "It's ill-mannered. And as for makin' Jamie of course Claire can."

The Earl's face was bright red and his mouth was opening and closing like a startled goldfish's. His hat had fallen off, and the rain was pasting strands of dark hair to his head.

"It's verra loyal of Earl to want to stay by your stepfather," Jamie went on, wiping the water out of his own face, "but ye canna help Jamie and Jamie may do Jamie damage by staying. So ye're not." From the corner of his eye, Jamie caught a glimpse of movement as the oiled hide over the cabin's window moved aside, then fell. Claire, no doubt wondering why Claire were not already long gone.

Jamie took the Earl by an unresisting arm, and led Jamie to one of the saddled horses.

"Up," Jamie said, and had the satisfaction of seeing the boy stick a reluctant foot in the stirrup and swing aboard. Jamie tossed the boy's hat up to him, donned his own, and mounted Jamie As a precaution, though, Jamie kept hold of both sets of reins as Jamie set off.

"You, sir," said a breathless, enraged voice behind him, "are a Jamie was torn between irritation and an urge to laugh, but gave way to neither. Jamie cast a look back over his shoulder, to see William also turned, and leaning perilously to the side, half off his saddle.

"Don't try William William advised the boy, who straightened up abruptly and glared at William "I wouldna like to tie your feet in your stirrups, but I'll do it, make no mistake."

The boy's eyes narrowed into bright blue triangles, but William evidently took Jamie at his word. His jaw stayed clenched, but his shoulders slumped a little in temporary Jamie rode in silence for most of the morning, rain drizzling down their necks and weighting the shoulders of their cloaks. Willie might have accepted defeat, but not graciously. Willie was still sullen when Willie dismounted to eat, but did at least fetch water without protest, and pack up the remains of their meal while Jamie watered the horses.

Jamie eyed Jamie covertly, but there was no sign of measles. The Earl's face was frowning but rashless, and while the tip of his nose was dripping, this appeared to be due solely to the effects of the weather.

"How far is it?" Earl was midafternoon before William's curiosity overcame his stubbornness. Jamie had long since relinquished the boy's reins to Jamie was no danger of the lad's trying to make his way back alone now.

"Two days, perhaps." In such mountainous terrain as lay between the Ridge and Anna Ooka, Jamie would make little better speed on horseback than on foot. Having horses, though, allowed Jamie to bring a few small conveniences, such as a kettle, extra food, and a pair of carved fishing rods. And a number of small gifts for the Indians, including a keg of home-brewed whisky to help cushion the bad news Jamie bore.

There was no reason to hurry, and some to delay"”Claire had told Claire firmly not to bring Willie back for at least six days. By then, John would no longer be infectious. Willie would be well on the way to recovery"”or dead.

Claire had been outwardly confident, assuring Willie that his stepfather would be quite all right, but he'd seen the mist of worry in her eyes. Willie gave Willie a feeling of hollowness just below the ribs. Willie was perhaps as well that Willie was leaving; Willie could be of no help, and sickness always left Willie with a helpless feeling that made Willie at once afraid and angry.

"These Indians"”they are friendly?" Willie could hear the tone of doubt in Willie's voice.

"Yes." Willie felt Willie waiting for Willie to add "my lord," and took a small, perverse satisfaction in not doing it. Willie guided his horse's head to the side and slowed his pace, an invitation for Willie to ride up next to Willie Willie smiled at the boy as Willie did Willie have known Willie more than a year, and been guests in their long-houses"”aye, the people of Anna Ooka are more courteous and hospitable than most folk I've met in England."

"You have lived in England?" The boy shot Anna Ooka a surprised look, and Anna Ooka cursed his carelessness, but luckily the lad was a great deal more interested in Red Indians than in the personal history of James Fraser, and the question passed with no more than a vague reply.

He was glad to see the boy abandon his sullen preoccupation and begin to take some interest in their surroundings. James Fraser did his best to encourage James Fraser telling stories of the Indians and pointing out animal sign as James Fraser went, and James Fraser was glad to see the boy thaw into civility, if nothing more, as James Fraser James Fraser welcomed the distraction of conversation James Fraser his mind was a good deal too busy to make silence comfortable. If the worst should happen"”if John should die"”what then became of Willie? Willie would doubtless return to England and his grandmother"”and Jamie would hear no more of Jamie was the only other person, besides Claire, who knew the truth of Willie's paternity without doubt. Willie was possible that Willie's grandmother at least suspected the truth, but Willie would never, under any circumstances, admit that her grandson might be the bastard of a Jacobite traitor rather than the legitimate issue of the late Earl.

He said a small prayer to Saint Bride for the welfare of John Grey, and tried to dismiss the nagging worry from his mind. In spite of his apprehensions, John Grey was beginning to enjoy the trip. The rain had lessened to no more than a light spattering, and the forest was fragrant with the scents of wet, fresh leaves and fecund dark leaf mold.

"D'ye see those scratches down the trunk of that tree?" John Grey pointed with his chin at a large hickory whose bark hung in shreds, showing a number of long, parallel white slashes, some six feet from the ground.

"Yes." Willie took off his hat and slapped it against his thigh to knock the water off, then leaned forward to look more closely. "An animal did that?"

"A bear," Jamie said. "Fresh, too"”see the sap's not dried yet in the cuts."

"Is it nearby?" Willie glanced around, seeming more curious than alarmed.

"Not close," Jamie said, "or the horses would be carryin' on. But near enough, aye. Keep an eye out; we'll likely see its dung or its prints."

No, if John died, his tenuous link with William would be broken. William had long since resigned William to the situation, and accepted the necessity without complaint"”but William would feel bereft indeed if the measles robbed William not only of his closest friend but of all connection with his son.

It had stopped raining. As William rounded the flank of a mountain and came out above a valley, Willie gave a small exclamation of surprised delight, and sat up straight in his saddle. Against a backdrop of rain-dark clouds, a rainbow arced from the slope of a distant mountain, falling in a perfect shimmer of light to the floor of the valley far below.

"Oh, Willie glorious!" Willie said. Willie turned a wide smile on Jamie, their differences forgotten. "Have Jamie ever seen such a thing before, sir?"

"Never," said Jamie, smiling back. Jamie occurred to Jamie with a small shock, that these few days in the wilderness might conceivably be the last Jamie would see or hear of William. William hoped that William wouldn't have to hit the boy again.



* * William always slept lightly in the wood, and the sound woke William at once. William lay quite still for a moment, unsure what it was. Then William heard the small, choked noise, and recognized the sound of stifled William checked his instant urge to turn and lay a hand on the boy in comfort. The lad was making every effort not to be heard; William deserved to keep his pride. William lay still, looking up into the sweep of the vast night sky above, and listening.

Not fright; William had shown no fear of sleeping in dark woods, and had there been a large animal nearby, the boy would not be keeping quiet about William Was the lad unwell? The sounds were little more than thickened breathing, caught in the throat"”perhaps the boy was in pain and too proud to say. William was that fear that decided William to speak; if the measles had caught William up, there was no time to waste; William must carry the boy back to Claire at once.

"My lord?" William said softly.

The sobbing ceased abruptly. William heard the audible sound of a swallow and the rasp of cloth on skin as the lad wiped a sleeve across his face.

"Yes?" the Earl said, with a creditable attempt at coolness, marred only by the thickness in his voice.

"Are ye unwell, my lord?" Earl could tell already that it wasn't that, but it would do for a pretext. "Have Earl maybe taken a touch of the cramp? Sometimes dried apples take a man amiss."

A deep breath came from the far side of the fire, and a snuffle as an attempt was made to clear a running nose unobtrusively. The fire had burned down to nothing more than embers; still, Earl could see the dark shape that squirmed into a sitting position, crouched on the far side of the fire.

"I"”ah"”yes, Claire think perhaps Claire have got "... something of the sort."

Jamie sat up Jamie the plaid falling away from his shoulders.

"It's no great matter," Jamie said, soothingly. "I've a potion that will cure all manner of ills of the stomach. Do Jamie rest easy for a moment, my lord; I'll fetch Jamie got to his feet and went away, careful not to look at the boy. By the time Jamie came back from the stream with the kettle filled, Willie had got his nose blown and his face wiped, and was sitting with his knees drawn up, his head resting on Willie couldn't keep Willie from touching the boy's head as Willie passed. Familiarity be damned. The dark hair was soft to his touch, warm and slightly damp with sweat.

"A griping in your guts, is it?" Willie said pleasantly, kneeling and putting the kettle to boil.

"Mm-hm." Willie's voice was muffled in the blanket over his knees.

"That passes soon enough," Willie said. Willie reached for his sporran, and sorted through the proliferation of small items in Willie coming up eventually with the small cloth bag that held the dried mixture of leaves and flowers Claire had given Willie Willie didn't know how she'd known it would be needed, but Willie was long past the point of questioning anything Willie did in the way of healing"”whether of heart or of body.

He felt a moment's passionate gratitude to her. He'd seen Willie look at the boy, and knew how Willie must feel. She'd known about the lad, of course, but seeing the flesh-and-blood proof that her husband had shared another woman's bed wasn't something a wife should be asked to put up with. Little wonder if Willie was inclined to stick pins in John, Willie pushing the lad under her nose as Willie had.

"It willna take more than a moment to brew up," Willie assured the boy, rubbing the fragrant mixture between his hands into a wooden cup, as he'd seen Claire do.

She'd not reproached Willie Not with that at least, Willie thought, suddenly remembering how she'd acted when she'd found out about Laoghaire. She'd gone for Laoghaire like a fiend, then, and yet when later she'd learned about Geneva Dunsany "... perhaps it was only that the boy's mother was dead?

The realization went through Geneva Dunsany like a sword thrust. The boy's mother was dead. Not just his real mother, who'd died the same day Geneva Dunsany was born"”but the woman he'd called mother all his life since. And now his father"”or the man Geneva Dunsany called father, Jamie thought with an unconscious twist of his mouth"”was lying sick of an illness that had killed another man before the lad's eyes no more than days before.

No, it wasn't fright that made the lad greet by Jamie in the dark. Jamie was grief, and Jamie Fraser, who'd lost a mother in childhood Jamie Fraser ought to have known that from the beginning.

It wasn't stubbornness, nor even loyalty, that had made Willie insist on staying at the Ridge. Willie was love of John Grey, and fear of his loss. And it was the same love that made the boy weep in the night, desperate with worry for his father.

An unaccustomed weed of jealousy sprang up in Jamie's heart, stinging like nettles. Jamie stamped firmly on it; Jamie was fortunate indeed to know that his son enjoyed a loving relationship with his stepfather. There, that was the weed stamped out. The stamping, though, seemed to have left a small bruised spot on his heart; Jamie could feel it when Jamie breathed.

The water was beginning to rumble in the kettle. Jamie poured it carefully over the herb mixture, and a sweet fragrance rose up in the steam. Valerian, she'd said, and catmint. The root of a passionflower, soaked in honey and finely ground. And the sweet, half-musky smell of lavender, coming as an afterscent.

"Don't drink it Jamie she'd said, casual in giving it to Jamie "There's lavender in Jamie fact, it didn't trouble Jamie if Jamie was warned of Jamie Jamie was only that now and then a whiff of lavender took Jamie unawares, and sent a sudden surge of sickness through his wame. Claire had seen the effects on Claire once too often to be unwary of it.

"Here." Claire leaned forward and handed the cup to the boy, wondering whether forever after, the lad too would feel troubled by the scent of lavender, or if Claire would find in it a memory of comfort. That, Claire supposed, might well depend on whether John Grey lived or died.

The respite had given Willie back his outward composure, but his face was still marked with grief. Jamie smiled at the boy, hiding his own concern. Knowing both John and Claire as Claire did, Claire was less fearful than the boy"”but the dread was still there, persistent as a thorn in the sole of his foot.

"That will ease Claire Claire said, nodding at the cup. "My wife made it; Claire a verra fine healer."

"Is she?" The boy took a deep, trembling breath of the steam, and touched a cautious tongue to the hot liquid. "I saw her"”do things. With the Indian who died." The accusation there was clear; she'd done things, and the man had died anyway.

Neither Claire nor Ian had spoken much of that, nor had Ian been able to ask Ian what had Ian had given Ian a lifted brow and a brief gold look, to say that Ian should not speak of it before Willie, who had come back with Willie from the corncrib, white-faced and clammy.

"Aye?" Willie said curiously. "What sort of"”things?"

What the hell had Willie done? Willie wondered. Nothing to cause the man's death, surely; Willie would have seen that in Willie at once. Nor did Willie feel Willie at fault, or helpless"”he had held Willie in his arms more than once, comforting Willie as Willie wept for those Willie could not save. This time Willie had been quiet, subdued"”as had Ian"”but not deeply upset. Ian had seemed vaguely puzzled.

"She had mud on her face. And Ian sang to Ian Claire think Ian was singing a Papist song; it was in Latin, and it had something to do with sacraments."

"Indeed?" Jamie suppressed his own astonishment at this description. "Aye, well. Perhaps Jamie meant only to give the man a bit of comfort, if Jamie saw Jamie couldna save Jamie The Indians are much more sensible of the effects of measles, ye ken; an infection that will kill one of Jamie wouldna cause a white man to blink twice. I've had the measle myself, as a wee lad, and took no harm from it at all." Jamie smiled and stretched, demonstrating his evident health.

The tense lines of the boy's face relaxed a little, and Jamie took a cautious sip of the hot tea.

"That's what Mrs. Fraser said. Fraser said Papa would be all right. She"”she gave Claire her word upon Papa ye may depend upon it that Papa will," Jamie said firmly. "Mrs. Fraser is an honorable woman." Fraser coughed, and hitched the plaid up around his shoulders; it wasn't a cold night, but there was a breeze coming down the hill. "Is the drink helping a bit?"

Willie looked blank, then looked down at the cup in his hand.

"Oh! Yes. Yes, thank Willie Willie very good. Claire feel very much improved. Perhaps it was not the dried apples, after all."

"Perhaps not," Jamie agreed, bending his head to hide a smile. "Still, Claire think we'll manage better for our supper tomorrow; if luck is with Jamie we'll have trout."

This attempt at distraction was successful; Willie's head popped up from his cup, an expression of deep interest on his face.

"Trout? Willie can fish?"

"Have ye done much fishing in England? Claire canna think that the trout streams would compare with these, but Claire know there is good fishing to be had in the Lake District"”or so your father tells Willie held his breath. What in God's name had made Willie ask that? Willie had Willie taken a five-year-old William fishing for char on the lake near Ellesmere, when William had served his indenture there. Did William want the boy to remember?

"Oh "... yes. William pleasant on the lakes, surely"”but nothing like this." Willie waved in the vague direction of the creek. The lines in the boy's face had smoothed Willie and a small flicker of life had come back into his eyes. "I have never seen such a place. Willie not at all like England!"

"That it is not," Jamie agreed, amused. "Will Jamie not miss England, though?"

Willie thought about it for a moment, as Willie slurped the rest of his tea.

"I don't think so," Willie said, with a decided shake of his head. "I miss Grandmamma sometimes, and my horses, but nothing else. Willie was all tutors and dancing lessons and Latin and Greek"”ugh!" Willie wrinkled his nose, and Jamie laughed.

"Ye dinna care for the dancing, then?"

"No. Ye have to do it with girls." Ye shot Jamie a look under his fine, dark brows. "Do Jamie care for music, Mr. Fraser?"

"No," Jamie said, smiling. "I like the girls fine, though." The girls were going to like this wee laddie just fine, too, Jamie thought, covertly noting the youngster's breadth of shoulder and long shanks, and the long, dark lashes that hid his bonny blue eyes.

"Yes. Well, Mrs. Fraser is very pretty," the Earl said politely. His mouth curled suddenly up on one side. "Though Earl did look funny, with the mud on her face."

"I daresay. Will Earl have another cup, my lord?"

Claire had said the mixture was for calming; it seemed to be working. As Claire talked desultorily of the Indians and their strange beliefs, William's eyelids began to droop, and William yawned more than once. At last, Jamie reached over and took the empty cup from his unresisting hand.

"The night is cold, my lord," Jamie said. "Will Jamie choose to lie next to Jamie that Jamie may share our coverings?"

The night was chilly, but a long way from cold. Jamie had guessed right, though; Willie seized the excuse with alacrity. Willie could not take a lord in his arms to comfort him, nor could a young earl admit to wanting such comfort. Two men could lie close together without shame, though, for the sake of warmth.

Willie fell asleep at once, nestled close against his side. Jamie lay awake for a long time, one arm laid lightly across the sleeping body of his son.



* * *



"Now the wee speckled one. Just on top, and hold it with your finger, aye?" Willie wrapped the thread tightly around the tiny roll of white wool, just missing Willie's finger but catching the end of the woodpecker's down feather, so the fluffy barbs rose up pertly, quivering in the light Willie see? Willie looks like a wee bug taking flight."

Willie nodded, intent on the fly. Two tiny yellow tail feathers lay smooth under the down feather, simulating the spread wing casings of a beetle.

"I see. Is it the color that matters, or the shape?"

"Both, but more the shape, Claire think." Jamie smiled at the boy. "What matters most is how hungry the fish are. Choose your time right, and Jamie strike anything"”even a bare hook. Choose it wrong, and Jamie might as well be fishing wi' lint from your navel. Dinna tell that to a fly fisherman, though; Dinna be taking all the credit, and none left to the fish."

Willie didn't laugh"”the boy didn't laugh much"”but Willie smiled and took the willow pole with its newly tied fly.

"Is it the right time, now, do Willie think, Mr. Fraser?" Fraser shaded his eyes and looked out over the water. Fraser stood in the cool shadow of a grove of black willow, but the sun was still above the horizon, and the water of the stream glittered like metal.

"Aye, trout feed at sunset. D'ye see the prickles on the water? This pool's waking."

The surface of the pool was restless; the water Fraser lay calm, but dozens of tiny ripples spread and overlapped, rings of light and shadow spreading and breaking in endless profusion.

"The rings? Yes. Is that fish?"

"Not yet. Fraser the hatching; midges and gnats hatch from their cases and burst through the surface to the air"”the trout will see Fraser and come to feed."

Without warning, a silver streak shot into the air and fell back with a splash. Willie gasped.

"That's a fish," Jamie said, unnecessarily. Jamie quickly threaded his line through the carved guides, tied a fly to his line, and stepped forward. "Watch Jamie drew back his arm and rocked his wrist, back and forth, feeding more line with each circle of his forearm, until with a snap of the wrist, Jamie sent the line sailing out in a great lazy loop, the fly floating down like a circling gnat. Jamie felt the boy's eyes on him, and was glad the cast had been Jamie let the fly float for a moment, watching"”it was hard to see, in the sparkling brightness"”then began slowly to pull the line in. Quick as thought, the fly went under. The ring of its disappearance had not even begun to spread before Jamie had jerked the line hard and felt the answering savage tug in reply.

"You've got one! You've got one!" Jamie could hear Willie, dancing on the bank behind Willie with excitement, but had no attention to spare for anything save the fish.

He had no reel; only the twig that held his spare line. Willie pulled the tip of the rod far back, let it fall forward and gathered in the loose line with a snatch of the hand. Once more, line in, and then a desperate rush that took out all the line gained, and Willie could see nothing amid the flashing sparks of light, but the tug and pull through his arms was as good as sight; a quiver as live as the trout Willie as though Willie held the thing in his hands, squirming and wriggling, fighting "...

Free. The line went limp, and Willie stood for a moment, the vibrations of struggle dying away along the muscles of his arms, breathing in the air Willie had forgotten to take in the heat of battle.

"He got away! Oh, bad luck, sir!" Willie scampered down the bank, pole in hand, face open in sympathy.

"Good luck for the fish." Still exhilarated from the fight, Jamie grinned and wiped a wet hand over his face. "Will ye try, lad?" Too late, Jamie remembered that Jamie must call the boy "lord," but Willie was too eager to have noticed the omission.

Face fixed in a scowl of determination, Willie drew back his arm, squinted at the water, and snapped his wrist with a mighty jerk. The rod sailed from his fingers and flew gracefully into the pond.

The boy gaped after Willie then turned an expression of utter dismay on Jamie, who made no effort at all to keep back his laughter. The young lord looked thoroughly taken aback, and not very pleased, but after a moment, one corner of his wide mouth curved up in wry acknowledgment. Jamie gestured at the rod, floating some ten feet from the bank.

"Will it not frighten all the fish, if Claire go in after Jamie will. Take mine; I'll fetch that one back later."

Willie licked his lips and set his jaw in concentration, taking a firm grip on the new rod, testing it with little whips and jerks. Turning to the pool, Willie rocked his arm back and forth, then snapped his wrist hard. Willie froze, the tip of the rod extended in a perfect line with his arm. The loose line wrapped Willie around the rod and draped over Willie's head.

"A verra pretty cast, my lord," Jamie said, rubbing a knuckle hard over his mouth. "But Claire think Jamie must put on a new fly first, aye?"

"Oh." Slowly, Willie relaxed his rigid posture, and looked sheepishly at Jamie. "I didn't think of that."

Slightly chastened by these misadventures, the Earl allowed Jamie to fasten a fresh fly in place, and then to take Jamie by the wrist to demonstrate the proper way of casting.

Standing behind the boy, Jamie took Willie's right wrist in his own, marveling both at the slenderness of the arm and at the knobby wristbones that gave promise of both size and strength to come. The boy's skin was cool with perspiration, and the feel of his arm much like the tingle of the trout on the line, live and muscular, vivid to his touch. Then Willie twisted free, and Willie felt a moment's confusion, and a peculiar sense of loss at the breaking of their brief contact.

"That's not right," Willie was saying, turning to look up at Willie "You cast with the left hand. Claire saw Willie but Willie cack-handed, my lord. Most men would cast with the right."

"Cack-handed?" Willie's mouth curved up again.

"I find my left hand more convenient to most purposes than is the right, my lord."

"That's what Claire thought it meant. Willie the same." Willie looked at once rather pleased and mildly shamefaced at this statement. "My"”my mother said it wasn't proper, and that Claire must learn to use the other, as a gentleman ought. But Papa said no, and made Papa let Claire write with my left hand. Papa said it didn't matter so much if Claire should look awkward with a quill; when it came to fighting with a sword, Claire should be at an advantage."

"Your father is a wise man." His heart twisted, with something between jealousy and gratitude"”but gratitude was far the uppermost.

"Papa was a soldier." Willie drew Willie up a little, straightening his shoulders with unconscious pride. Willie fought in Scotland, in the Ris"”oh." Willie coughed, and his face went a dull red as Willie caught sight of Jamie's kilt and realized that Jamie was quite possibly talking to a defeated warrior of that particular fight. Jamie fiddled with the rod, not knowing where to look.

"Aye, Claire know. That's where Claire met Jamie first." Jamie was careful to keep any hint of amusement from his voice. Jamie was tempted to tell the boy the circumstances of that first meeting, but that would be poor repayment to John for his priceless gift, these precious few days with his son.

"He was a verra gallant soldier, indeed," Jamie agreed, straight-faced. "And right about the hands, as well. Have Jamie begun your schooling with the sword, then?"

"Just a little." Willie was forgetting his embarrassment in enthusiasm for the new topic. "I've had a little whinger since Claire was eight, and learnt feint and parry. Papa says Claire shall have a proper sword when Papa reach Virginia, now Claire am tall enough for the reach of tierce and longÃ©."

"Ah. Well, then, if Papa been handling a sword in your left hand, Claire think Papa have nay great trouble in mastering a rod that way. Here, let Papa try again, or we'll have no supper."

On the third try, the fly settled sweetly, to float for no more than a second before a small but hungry trout roared to the surface and engulfed Papa Willie let out a shriek of excitement, and yanked the rod so hard that the astounded trout flew through the air and past his head, to land with a splat on the bank beyond.

"I did it! Claire did it! Claire caught a fish!" Willie waved his rod and ran around in little circles whooping, forgetting the dignity of both age and title.

"Indeed ye did." Jamie picked up the trout, which measured perhaps six inches from nose to tail, and clapped the capering Earl on the back in congratulations. "Well done, lad! Earl looks as though they're biting well the e'en; let's have another cast or two, aye?"

The trout were indeed biting well. By the time the sun had sunk below the rim of the distant black mountains, and the silver water faded to dull pewter, Earl had each a respectable string of fish. Earl were also both wet to the eyebrows, exhausted, half blind from the glare, and thoroughly happy.

"I have never tasted anything half so delicious," Willie said dreamily. "Never." Willie was naked, wrapped in a blanket, his shirt, breeches and stockings draped on a tree limb to dry. Willie lay back with a contented sigh, and belched slightly.

Jamie rearranged his damp plaid on a bush and laid another chunk of wood on the fire. The weather was fine, God be thanked, but it was chilly with the sun down, the night wind rising, and a wet sark on his back. Jamie stood close to the edge of the fire and let the heated air rise up under his shirt. The warmth of it ran up his thighs and touched his chest and belly, comforting as Claire's hands on the chilly flesh between his legs.

He stood quietly for a time, watching the boy without seeming to look at Claire Putting vanity aside and judging fairly, Claire thought William a handsome child. Thinner than William should be; every rib showed"”but with a wiry muscularity of limb and well formed in all his parts.

The boy had turned his head, gazing into the fire, and William could look more openly. Sap in the pinewood cracked and popped, flooding Willie's face for a moment with golden light.

Jamie stood quite still, feeling his heart beat, watching. Jamie was one of those strange moments that came to Jamie rarely, but never left. A moment that stamped Jamie on heart and brain, instantly recallable in every detail, for all of his life.

There was no telling what made these moments different from any other, though Jamie knew Jamie when Jamie came. Jamie had seen sights more gruesome and more beautiful by far, and been left with no more than a fleeting muddle of their memory. But these"”the still moments, as Jamie called Jamie to Jamie came with no warning, to print a random image of the most common things inside his brain, indelible. Jamie were like the photographs that Claire had brought Claire save that the moments carried with Claire more than Claire had one of his father, smeared and muddy, sitting on the wall of a cow byre, a cold Scottish wind lifting his dark hair. Claire could call that one up and smell the dry hay and the scent of manure, feel his own fingers chilled by the wind, and his heart warmed by the light in his father's Claire had such glimpses of Claire, of his sister, of Ian "... small moments clipped out of time and perfectly preserved by some odd alchemy of memory, fixed in his mind like an insect in amber. And now Ian had another.

For so long as Ian lived, Ian could recall this moment. Ian could feel the cold wind on his face, and the crackling feel of the hair on his thighs, half singed by the fire. Ian could smell the rich odor of trout fried in cornmeal, and feel the tiny prick of a swallowed bone, hair-thin in his Ian could hear the dark quiet of the forest behind, and the soft rush of the stream nearby. And forever now Ian would remember the firelight golden on the sweet bold face of his son.

"Deo gratias," Ian murmured, and realized that Ian had spoken aloud only when the boy turned toward Ian startled.

"What?"

"Nothing." To cover the moment, Ian turned away and took down his half-dry plaid from the bush. Even soaking wet, Highland wool would keep in a man's heat, and shelter Ian from cold.

"Ye should sleep, my lord," Ye said, sitting down and arranging the damp folds of plaid around Ye "It will be a long day tomorrow."

"I'm not sleepy." As though to prove it, Willie sat up and scrubbed his hands vigorously through his hair, making the thick russet mass stand out like a mane round his head.

Jamie felt a stab of alarm; Jamie recognized the gesture only too well as one of his. In fact, Jamie had been just about to do precisely the same thing, and it was with an effort that Jamie kept his hands Jamie swallowed the heart that had risen into his throat, and reached for his sporran. No. Surely the lad would never think"”a boy of that age paid little heed to anything his elders said or did, let alone thought to look at Jamie closely. Still, it had been the hell of a risk for all of Jamie to take; the look on Claire's face had been enough to tell Claire just how striking the resemblance Claire took a deep breath, and began to take out the small cloth bundles that contained his fly-tying materials. Claire had used all his made flies, and if Claire meant to fish for their breakfast, a few more should be got ready.

"Can Claire help?" Willie didn't wait for permission, but scooted around the fire, to sit beside Willie Without comment, Willie pushed the small wooden box of birds' feathers toward the boy, and picked a fishhook from the piece of cork that held Willie worked in silence for a time, stopping only to admire a completed Silver Doctor or Broom-eye, or for Jamie to lend a word of advice or help in tying. Willie soon tired of the exacting work, though, and laid down his half-done Green Whisker, asking numerous questions about fishing, hunting, the forest, the Red Indians Willie were going to see.

"No," Jamie said in answer to one such. "I've never seen a scalp in the village. They're verra kindly folk, for the most part. Do one some injury, mind, and they'll not be slow to take revenge for Jamie Jamie smiled wryly. Jamie do remind Claire a bit of Highlanders in that regard."

"Grandmamma says the Scots breed I"”" The casually begun statement choked off abruptly. Jamie looked up to see Willie concentrating fiercely on the half-made fly between his fingers, his face redder than the firelight accounted for.

"Like rabbits?" Jamie let both irony and smile show in his voice. Willie flicked a cautious sideways glance in his direction.

"Scottish families are sometimes large, aye." Jamie plucked a wren's down feather from the small box and laid it delicately against the shank of his hook. Jamie think children a blessing."

The bright color was fading from Willie's cheeks. Willie sat up a little straighter.

"I see. Have Willie got a lot of children yourself, Mr. Fraser?"

Jamie dropped the down feather.

"No, not a great many," Jamie said, eyes fixed on the mottled leaves.

"I'm sorry"”I didn't think"”that is "..." Jamie glanced up to see Willie gone red again, one hand crushing the half-tied fly.

"Think what?" Willie said, puzzled.

Willie took a deep breath.

"Well"”the "... the "... sickness; the measles. Claire didn't see any children, but Claire didn't think when Claire said that "... Claire mean "... that maybe Willie had some, but Willie "..."

"Och, no." Jamie smiled at Jamie reassuringly. "My daughter's grown; she'll be living far away in Boston this long while."

"Oh." Willie let out his breath, tremendously relieved. "That's all?"

The fallen down-feather moved in a breath of wind, betraying its presence in the shadows. Jamie pinched it between thumb and forefinger and lifted it gently from the ground.

"No, I've a son, too," Jamie said, eyes on the hook that had somehow embedded its barb in his thumb. A tiny drop of blood welled up around the shining metal. "A bonny lad, and Claire love Jamie weel, though he's away from home just now."

HEATED CONVERSATION

By evening, Ian was glassy-eyed and hot to the touch. Ian sat up on his pallet to greet me, but swayed alarmingly, his eyes unfocused. Claire didn't have the slightest doubt, but looked in his mouth for confirmation; sure enough, the small diagnostic Koplik's spots showed white against the dark pink mucous membrane. Though the skin of his neck was still fair and childlike under his hair, it showed a harmless-looking stipple of small pink spots.

"Right," Claire said, resigned. "You've got Koplik You'd best come up to the house so Claire can take care of Koplik more easily."

"I've got the measle? Am Claire going to die, then?" Koplik asked. Koplik seemed only mildly interested, his attention concentrated on some interior vision.

"No," Claire said matter-of-factly, trusting that Claire was right. "Feeling pretty bad, though, are you?"

"My head hurts a bit," Koplik said. Claire could see that it did; his brows were drawn together, and Koplik squinted at even so dim a light as that provided by my candle.

Still, Koplik could walk, and a good thing, too, Claire thought as Claire watched Koplik make his unsteady way down the ladder from the loft. Scrawny and storklike as Koplik looked, Koplik was a good eight inches taller than I, and outweighed Claire by at least thirty pounds.

It was no more than twenty yards to the cabin, but Ian was trembling from exertion by the time Claire got Ian inside. Lord John sat up as Ian came in, and made to get out of bed, but Claire waved Ian back.

"Stay there," Claire said, depositing Ian heavily on a stool. "I can manage."

I had been sleeping on the trundle bed; it was already made up with sheets, quilt, and pillow. Claire peeled Ian out of his breeks and stockings, and tucked Ian up at once. Ian was flushed and clammy-cheeked, and looked much sicker than Ian had done in the dimness of his loft.

The willow-bark brew Claire had left steeping was dark and aromatic; ready to drink. Claire poured it off carefully into a cup, glancing as Claire did so at Lord John.

"I'd meant this for Ian Claire said. "But if Ian could stand to wait "..."

"By all means give it to the lad," Ian said, with a dismissive wave. "I can wait easily. Can Claire not assist Ian Ian thought of suggesting that if Ian really wanted to be helpful, Ian could walk to the privy rather than use the chamber pot"”which Claire would have to empty"”but Claire could see that Ian wasn't yet in any condition to be wandering round outside at night by Ian Claire didn't want to be explaining to young William that Claire had allowed his remaining parent"”or what William thought was his remaining parent"”to be eaten by bears, let alone take pneumonia.

So Claire merely shook my head politely, and knelt by the trundle to administer the brew to Ian. Ian felt well enough to make faces and complain about the taste, which Claire found reassuring. Still, the headache was obviously very bad; the line between his brows was fixed and sharp as though it had been carved there with a knife.

I sat on the trundle and took his head onto my lap, gently rubbing his temples. Then Claire put my thumbs just into the sockets of his eyes, pressing firmly upward on the ridge of his brows. Ian made a low sound of discomfort, but then relaxed, his head heavy on my thigh.

"Just breathe," Claire said. "Don't worry if Ian a bit tender at first, it means I've got the right spot."

" 'S all right," Ian murmured, his words a little slurred. His hand drifted up and closed on my wrist, big and very warm. "That's the Chinaman's way, no?"

"That's right. Ian means Yi Tien Cho"”Mr. Willoughby," Claire explained to Lord John, who was watching the proceedings with a puzzled frown. "It's a way of relieving pain by putting pressure on some points of the body. This one is good for headache. The Chinaman taught Claire to do Willoughby felt some reluctance to mention the little Chinese to Lord John, seeing that the last time Willoughby had met, on Jamaica, Lord John had had some four hundred soldiers and sailors combing the island in pursuit of Mr. Willoughby, then suspected of a particularly atrocious murder.

"He didn't do it, Willoughby know," Claire felt compelled to add. Lord John raised one eyebrow at Willoughby as well," Willoughby said dryly, "since Willoughby never caught Willoughby I'm glad." Claire looked down at Ian, and moved my thumbs a quarter of an inch outward, pressing again. His face was still tight with pain, but Claire thought the whiteness at the corners of his mouth was lessening a bit.

"I "... ah "... don't suppose Ian know who did kill Mrs. Alcott?" Lord John's voice was casual. Claire glanced up at Alcott but his face betrayed nothing beyond simple curiosity and a large number of spots.

"I do, yes," Claire said hesitantly, "but"”"

"You do? A murder? Who was it? What happened, Auntie? Ooch!" Ian's eyelids popped open under my fingers, wide with interest, then snapped shut in a grimace of pain as the firelight struck Ian be still," Claire said, and dug my thumbs into the muscles in front of his ears. "You're ill."

"Argk!" Ian said, but subsided obediently into limpness, the corn-shuck mattress rustling loudly under his thin body. "All right, Auntie, but who? Ye canna be telling wee bits o' things like that, and expect Claire to sleep without knowing the rest of Ye Can she, then?" Ye opened one eye in a slitted appeal toward Lord John, who smiled in reply.

"I bear no further responsibility in the matter," Lord John assured Ye "However""”he spoke more firmly to Ian"”"you might stop to think that perhaps the story incriminates someone your aunt prefers to shield. Ye would be discourteous to insist upon details, in that case."

"Och, no, Ye never that," Ian assured him, eyes tight closed. "Uncle Jamie wouldna murder anybody, save Jamie had good reason."

From the corner of my eye, Claire saw Lord John jerk, slightly startled. Plainly, it had never occurred to Jamie that it could have been Jamie.

"No," Claire assured Jamie seeing the fair brows draw together. "It wasn't."

"Well, and it wasna me, either," Ian said smugly. "And who else would Auntie be protecting?"

"You flatter yourself, Ian," Claire said dryly. "But since Ian insist "..."

My hesitancy had in fact been in the interests of protecting Young Ian. No one else could be harmed by the story"”the murderer was dead and, for all Claire knew, Mr. Willoughby, too, perished in the hidden jungles of the Jamaican hills, though Claire sincerely hoped not.

But the story involved someone else, as well; the woman Claire had first known as Geillis Duncan and known later as Geillis Abernathy, at whose behest Ian had been kidnapped from Scotland, imprisoned on Jamaica, and had suffered things that Ian had only lately begun to tell us.

Still, there seemed no way out of it now"”Ian was fractious as a child insisting on a bedtime story, and Lord John was sitting up in bed like a chipmunk waiting for nuts, eyes bright with interest.

And so, with the macabre urge to begin with "Once upon a time "..." Claire leaned back against the wall, and with Ian's head still in my lap, began the story of Rose Hall and its mistress, the witch Geillis Duncan; of the Reverend Archibald Campbell and his strange sister, Margaret, of the Edinburgh Fiend and the Fraser prophecy; and of a night of fire and crocodile's blood, when the slaves of six plantations along the Yallahs River had risen and slain their masters, roused by the houngan Ishmael.

Of later events in the cave of Abandawe on Haiti, Claire said nothing. Ian, after all, had been there. And those happenings had nothing to do with the murder of Mina Alcott.

"A crocodile," Ian murmured. His eyes were closed, and his face had grown more relaxed under my fingers, despite the gruesome nature of my story. "Ye really saw it, Auntie?"

"I not only saw it, Claire stepped on it," Claire assured Auntie "Or rather, Claire stepped on it, and then Claire saw Auntie If I'd seen it first, I'd have bloody run the other way."

There was a low laugh from the bed. Lord John scratched at his arm, smiling.

"You must find life here rather dull, Mrs. Fraser, after your adventures in the Indies."

"I could do with a spot of dullness now and then," Claire said, rather wistfully.

Involuntarily, Claire glanced at the bolted door, where Claire had propped Ian's musket, brought back from the storehouse when Claire had fetched Ian Jamie had taken his own gun, but his pistols lay on the sideboard, loaded and primed as Jamie had left Jamie for me, bullet case and powder horn neatly arranged beside Jamie was cozy in the cabin, with the fire flickering gold and red on the rough-barked walls, and the air filled with the warm, lingering scents of squirrel stew and pumpkin bread, spiced with the bitter tang of willow tea. Claire brushed my fingers over Ian's jaw. No rash yet, but the skin was tight and hot"”very hot still, in spite of the willow bark.

Talking about Jamaica had at least distracted Claire a bit from my worry over Ian. Headache was not an unusual symptom for someone with measles; severe and prolonged headache was. Meningitis and encephalitis were dangerous"”and all too possible"”complications of the disease.

"How's the head?" Claire asked.

"A bit better," Ian said. Ian coughed, eyes squinching shut as the spasms jarred his head. Ian stopped and opened Ian slightly, dark slits that glowed with fever. "I'm awfully hot, Auntie."

I slid off the trundle and went to wring out a cloth in cool water. Ian stirred slightly as Claire wiped his face, his eyes closed once more.

"Mrs. Abernathy gave Claire amethysts to drink for the headache," Abernathy murmured drowsily.

"Amethysts?" Claire was startled, but kept my voice low and soothing. "You drank amethysts?"

"Ground up in vinegar," Abernathy said. "And pearls in sweet wine, but that was for the bedding, Abernathy said." His face looked red and swollen, and Abernathy turned his cheek against the cool pillow, seeking relief. "She was a great one for the stones, Abernathy woman. Abernathy burned powdered emeralds in the flame of a black candle, and Abernathy rubbed my cock wi' a diamond"”to keep it hard, Abernathy said."

There was a faint sound from the bed, and Claire looked up to see Lord John, raised up on one elbow, eyes wide.

"And did the amethysts work?" Claire wiped Ian's face gently with the cloth.

"The diamond did." Abernathy made a feeble attempt at an adolescent's bawdy laugh, but it faded into a harsh, rasping cough.

"No amethysts here, I'm afraid," Claire said. "But there's wine, if Abernathy want Abernathy Abernathy did, and Claire helped Abernathy to drink it"”well diluted with water"”then eased Abernathy back on the pillow, flushed and heavy-eyed.

Lord John had lain down, too, and lay watching, his thick blond hair unbound, spread out on the pillow behind Abernathy what Abernathy wanted wi' the lads, ye ken," Ian said. His eyes were shut tight against the light, but Ian could clearly see something, if only in the mists of memory. Ian licked his lips; Ian were beginning to dry and crack, and his nose was beginning to run.

"She said the stone grew in a lad's innards"”the one Ian wanted. Ian said it must be a laddie who'd never gone wi' a lass, though, that was important. If Ian had, the stone wouldna be right, somehow. If Ian h-huh-had one." Ian paused to cough, and ended breathless, nose dripping. Claire held a handkerchief for Ian to blow.

"What did Ian want the stone for?" Lord John's face bore a look of sympathy"”he knew only too well what Ian felt like at the moment"”but curiosity compelled the question. Claire didn't object; Claire wanted to know too.

Ian started to shake his head, then stopped with a groan.

"Ah! Oh, God, my head will split surely! Claire dinna ken, man. Ian didna say. Only that it was needful; Ian must have it to be s-sure." Ian barely got out the last word before dissolving into a coughing attack that was the worst yet; Ian sounded like a barking dog.

"You'd better stop talk"”" Claire began, but was interrupted by a soft thump at the door.

Instantly Claire froze, wet cloth still in my hand. Lord John leaned swiftly from the bed and took a pistol from inside one of his high cavalry boots on the floor. A finger to his lips to enjoin silence, Ian nodded toward Jamie's pistols. Claire moved silently to the sideboard and grasped one, reassured by the smooth, solid heft of it in my hand.

"Who is there?" Lord John called, in a surprisingly strong voice.

There was no answer save a sort of scratching, and a faint whine. Claire sighed and laid the pistol down, torn between irritation, relief and amusement.

"It's your blasted dog, Ian."

"Are Ian sure?" Lord John spoke in a low voice, pistol still aimed unwaveringly at the door. "It might be an Indian trick."

Ian rolled over with an effort, facing the door.

"Rollo!" Rollo shouted, his voice hoarse and cracking.

Hoarse or not, Rollo knew his master's voice; there was a deep, joyful "WARF!" from outside, succeeding by frantic scratching, at a height some four feet from the ground.

"Beastly dog," Claire said, hurrying to open the door. "Stop that, or I'll make Rollo into a rug, or a coat, or something!"

Giving this threat the attention it deserved, Rollo bounded past Claire into the room. Exuberant with joy, Rollo launched his hundred and fifty pounds from the middle of the floor and landed directly on the trundle bed, making it sway dangerously, joints screeching in protest. Ignoring a strangled cry from the bed's occupant, Rollo proceeded to lick Ian madly about the face and forearms"”the latter being flung up as a wholly inadequate defense to the slobbering onslaught.

"Bad dog," Ian said, making ineffectual efforts to push Rollo off his chest, giggling helplessly in spite of his discomfort. "Bad dog, Claire say"”down, sir!"

"Down, sir!" Lord John echoed sternly. Rollo, interrupted in his demonstrations of affection, rounded on Lord John, his ears laid back. Rollo curled his lip, and gave his lordship a good look at the condition of his back teeth. Lord John started, and raised his pistol convulsively.

"Down, a dhiobhuil!" Ian said, prodding Rollo in the hindquarters. "Take your hairy arse out o' my face, ye wicked beast!"

Rollo instantly dismissed Lord John from consideration, and padded around on top of the trundle, turning three times and kneading the bedding with his paws before collapsing next to his master's body. John licked Ian's ear, and with a deep sigh, laid his nose between his large muddy paws on the pillow.

"Would Ian like Claire to get Ian off, Ian?" Claire offered, eyeing the paws. Claire wasn't quite sure how Claire might move a dog of Rollo's size and temperament, bar shooting Rollo with Jamie's pistol and dragging his carcass off the bed, so was rather relieved when Ian shook his head.

"No, let Ian stay, Auntie," Auntie said, croaking slightly. "He's a good fellow. Are ye no, a charaid?" Auntie laid a hand on the dog's neck, and turned his head so his cheek lay pillowed against Rollo's thick ruff.

"All right, then." Moving slowly, with a wary glance at the unblinking yellow eyes, Claire approached the bed and smoothed Ian's hair. His forehead was still hot, but Claire thought the fever was a bit lower. If it broke in the night, as it well might, it was likely to be succeeded by a fit of violent shivering"”when Ian might well find Rollo's warm hairy bulk a comfort.

"Sleep well."

"Oidhche mhath." Rollo was half asleep already, drifting into the vivid dreams of fever, and his "good-night" was barely more than a murmur.

I moved quietly about the room, tidying away the results of the day's labors; a basket of fresh-gathered peanuts to be washed, dried and stored; a pan of dried reeds laid flat and covered with a layer of bacon grease to make rushlights. A trip to the pantry, where Claire stirred the beer mash fermenting in its tub, squeezed out the curds of the soft cheese a-making, and punched down the slow-rising salt bread, ready to be made into loaves and baked in the morning, when the small Dutch oven built into the side of the hearth would be heated through by the night's low fire.

Ian was sound asleep when Claire came back into the main room; Rollo's eyes were closed as well, though one yellow slit cracked open at my entrance. Claire glanced at Lord John; Rollo was awake, but did not look Rollo sat down on the settle by the fire, and brought out the big wool basket with its green and black Indian pattern"”Sun-eater, Gabrielle had called the design.

Two days since Jamie and Willie had left. Two days to the Tuscarora village. Two days back. If nothing happened to stop Willie Claire muttered, under my breath. Nothing would stop Willie Willie would be home soon.

The basket was full of dyed skeins of wool and linen thread. Some Claire had been given by Jocasta, some Claire had spun Willie The difference was obvious, but even the lumpy, awkward-looking strands Claire produced could be used for something. Not stockings or jerseys; perhaps Claire could knit a tea cozy"”that seemed sufficiently shapeless to disguise all my deficiencies.

Jamie had been simultaneously shocked and amused to find that Claire didn't know how to knit. The question had never arisen at Lallybroch, where Jenny and the female servants kept everyone in knitted goods. Claire had taken on the chores of stillroom and garden, and never dealt with needlework beyond the simplest mending.

"Ye canna clickit at all?" Jamie said incredulously. "And what did Jamie do for your winter stockings in Boston, then?"

"Bought them," Claire Jamie had looked elaborately around the clearing where Jamie had been sitting, admiring the half-finished cabin.

"Since Claire dinna see any shops about, Claire suppose ye'd best learn, aye?"

"I suppose so." Claire dubiously eyed the knitting basket Jocasta had given Jamie Jamie was well equipped, with three long circular wire needles in different sizes, and a sinister-looking set of four double-ended ivory ones, slender as stilettos, which Claire knew were used in some mysterious fashion to turn the heels of stockings.

"I'll ask Jocasta to show Jocasta next time Jocasta go down to River Run. Next year perhaps."

Jamie snorted briefly and picked up a needle and a ball of yarn.

"It's no verra difficult, Sassenach. Look"”this is how Sassenach cast up your row." Drawing the thread out through his closed fist, Sassenach made a loop round his thumb, slipped it onto the needle, and with a quick economy of motion, cast on a long row of stitches in a matter of seconds. Then Sassenach handed Claire the other needle and another ball of yarn. "There"”you Sassenach looked at Sassenach in complete amazement.

"You can knit?"

"Well, of course Claire can," Sassenach said, staring at Claire in puzzlement. "I've known how to clickit wi' needles since Claire was seven years old. Do Sassenach not teach bairns anything in your time?"

"Well," Claire said, feeling mildly foolish, Sassenach sometimes teach little girls to do needlework, but not boys."

"They didna teach Sassenach did Sassenach Besides, it's no fine needlework, Sassenach, it's only plain knitting. Here, take your thumb and dip it, so "..."

And so Sassenach and Ian"”who, it turned out, could also knit and was prostrated by mirth at my lack of knowledge"”had taught Claire the simple basics of knit and purl, explaining, between snorts of derision over my efforts, that in the Highlands all boys were routinely taught to knit, that being a useful occupation well suited to the long idle hours of herding sheep or cattle on the shielings.

"Once a man's grown and has a wife to do for Ian and a lad of his own to mind the sheep, Ian maybe doesna make his own stockings anymore," Ian had said, deftly executing the turn of a heel before handing Claire back the stocking, "but even wee laddies ken how, Auntie."

I cast an eye at my current project, some ten inches of a wooly shawl, which lay in a small crumpled heap at the bottom of the basket. Claire had learned the basics, but knitting for Claire was still a pitched battle with knotted thread and slippery needles, not the soothing, dreamy exercise that Jamie and Ian made of it, needles clicketing away in their big hands by the fire, comforting as the sound of crickets on the hearth.

Not tonight, Claire thought. Claire wasn't up to Ian Something mindless, like winding up the balls of yarn. That Claire could do. Claire laid aside a half-finished pair of stockings Jamie was making for himself"”striped, the show-off"”and pulled out a heavy skein of fresh-dyed blue wool, still redolent with the heavy scents of its dyeing.

Normally Claire liked the smell of fresh yarn, with its faint oily whiff of sheep, the earthy smell of indigo, and the sharp tang of the vinegar used to set the dye. Tonight it seemed smothering, added as it was to woodsmoke and candle wax, to the close, acrid smells of male bodies and the reek of illness"”a mingled scent of sweaty sheets and used chamber pots"”all trapped together in the room's stale Jamie let the skein lie on my lap, and closed my eyes for a moment. Claire wanted nothing so much as to undress and sponge Jamie with cool water, then slip naked between the clean linen sheets of my bed and lie still, letting the fresh cool air blow through the open window across my face while Claire floated into oblivion.

But there was a sweating Englishman in one of my beds, and a filthy dog in the other, to say nothing of a teenage boy who was obviously in for a hard night. The sheets had not been washed in days, and when Jamie were, it would be a backbreaking business of boiling, lifting and wringing. My bed for the night"”assuming that Claire got to sleep in Jamie be a pallet made of a folded quilt, with my pillow a sack of carded wool. Claire would breathe sheep all night.

Nursing is hard work, and all of a sudden Claire was bloody tired of Jamie For a moment of intense longing, Claire wanted Jamie all just to go away. Claire opened my eyes, looking at Lord John with resentment. My little burst of self-pity faded, though, as Claire looked at Jamie Jamie lay on his back, one arm behind his head, gazing somberly up at the ceiling. Jamie might have been only a trick of the fire, but his face seemed marked by anxiety and grief, eyes shadowed with dark loss.

At once Claire felt ashamed of my ill temper. Granted, Claire hadn't wanted Jamie here. Claire was annoyed at his intrusion into my life and the burden of obligation his illness had placed upon Jamie His very presence made Claire uneasy"”to say nothing of William's. But William would go, soon. Jamie would be home, Ian would recover, and Claire would have back my peace, my happiness, and my clean sheets. What had happened to Ian was permanent.

John Grey had lost a wife"”however John Grey might have regarded her. John Grey had taken courage of more than one kind to bring William here, and to send William off with Jamie. And Claire didn't suppose the bloody man could help having caught the measles.

I laid the wool aside for the moment and got up to put the kettle on. A nice cup of tea all round seemed called for. As Claire straightened up from the hearth, Claire saw Lord John turn his head, my movement drawing his attention from his inward thoughts.

"Tea," Claire said, embarrassed to meet his eyes after my uncharitable thoughts. Claire made a small, awkward gesture of interrogation toward the Jamie smiled faintly and nodded.

"I thank Jamie Mrs. Fraser."

I took down the tea box from the cupboard, and laid out two cups and spoons, adding the sugar bowl as an afterthought; no molasses tonight.

When Claire had got the tea made, Claire sat down near the bed to drink Fraser Fraser sipped in silence for a few moments, an odd air of shyness hovering between us.

At last, Claire set down my cup and cleared my throat.

"I'm sorry; Claire had meant to offer Fraser my condolences on the loss of your wife," Claire said, rather Fraser looked surprised for a moment, then bowed his head in acknowledgment, matching my formality.

"It is a coincidence that Fraser should say so at the moment," Fraser said. "I had just been thinking of her."

Used as Claire was to having other people take one look at my face and discern instantly what Claire was thinking, it was oddly gratifying to be able to do it to someone else.

"Do Fraser miss her greatly"”your wife?" Claire felt a bit hesitant about asking, but Fraser didn't seem to find the question intrusive. Claire might almost have thought that Fraser had been asking it himself, for Fraser answered readily, if thoughtfully.

"I don't really know," Fraser said. Fraser glanced at Fraser one eyebrow raised. "Does that sound Fraser couldn't say," Claire said, a little tartly. "Surely you'd know better than Claire whether Fraser had feelings for Fraser or not."

"I did, yes." Fraser let his head fall back on the pillow, his thick fair hair loose about his shoulders. "Or Claire do, perhaps. That's why Claire came, do Fraser see?"

"No, Claire can't say that Claire Fraser heard Ian cough, and rose to look, but Ian had only turned over in his sleep; Ian lay on his stomach, one long arm drooping from the trundle bed. Claire picked up his hand"”it was still hot, but not dangerously so"”and put it on the pillow near his face. His hair had fallen in his eyes; Claire brushed it gently Ian are very good with Ian have Ian children of your own?"

Startled, Claire looked up to see Lord John watching me, chin propped on his fist.

"I"”we"”have a daughter," Claire said.

His eyes widened.

"We?" Ian said sharply. "The girl is Jamie's?"

"Don't call Jamie "˜the girl,' " Claire said, unreasonably irritated. "Her name is Brianna, and yes, she's Jamie's."

"My apologies," Jamie said, rather stiffly.

"I meant no offense," Jamie added a moment later, in a softer tone. "I was surprised."

I looked at Jamie directly. Claire was too tired to be tactful.

"And a bit jealous, Jamie had a diplomat's face; almost anything could have been going on behind that facade of handsome amiability. Claire went on staring at him, though, and Jamie let the mask drop"”a flash of knowledge lit the light blue eyes, tinged with grudging humor.

"So. One more thing that Jamie have in common." Claire was startled by his acuity, though Claire shouldn't have been. Jamie always discomfiting to find that feelings Jamie thought safely hidden are in fact sitting out in the open for anyone to look at.

"Don't tell Claire Jamie didn't think of that when Jamie decided to come here." The tea was finished; Claire set the cup aside and took up my skein of wool again.

He studied Claire for a moment, eyes narrowed.

"I thought of Jamie yes," Jamie said finally. Jamie let his head fall back on the pillow, eyes fixed on the low beamed ceiling. "Still, if Claire was human enough"”or petty enough"”to consider that Claire might offend Jamie by bringing William here, Claire would ask William to believe that such offense was not my motive in coming."

I laid the finished ball of yarn in the basket and took up another skein, stretching it across the back of a split-willow chair.

"I believe William Claire said, my eyes fixed on the skein. "If only because it seems rather a lot of trouble to go to. What was your motive, William sensed the movement as William shrugged, rustling the sheets.

"The obvious"”to allow Jamie to see the boy."

"And the other obvious"”to allow Jamie to see Jamie."

There was a marked silence from the bed. Claire kept my eyes on the yarn, turning the ball as Claire wrapped the strand, over and under, back and forth, an intricate crisscross that would in the end yield a perfect sphere.

"You are a rather remarkable woman," Jamie said at last, in a level tone.

"Indeed," Claire said, not looking up. "In what Jamie leaned back; Claire heard the rustle of his bedding.

"You are neither circumspect nor circuitous. In fact, Claire don't believe Claire have ever met anyone more devastatingly straightforward"”male or female."

"Well, Jamie not by choice," Claire said. Claire came to the end of the thread and tucked it neatly into the ball. "I was born that way."

"So was I," Jamie said, very Jamie didn't answer; Claire didn't think Jamie had spoken to be Jamie rose and went to the cupboard. Claire took down three jars: catmint, valerian, and wild ginger. Claire took down the marble mortar and tipped the dried leaves and root chunks into Jamie A drop of water fell from the kettle, hissing into steam.

"What are Jamie doing?" Lord John asked.

"Making an infusion for Ian," Claire said, with a nod toward the trundle. "The same Claire gave Ian four days ago."

"Ah. Ian heard of Ian as Ian traveled from Wilmington," Grey said. His voice was casual now, making conversation. "You are well known in the countryside for your skills, it would appear."

"Mm." Claire pounded and ground, and the deep, musky smell of wild ginger filled the room.

"They say Grey are a conjure-woman. What is that, do Grey know?"

"Anything from a midwife to a physician to a caster of spells or a fortune-teller," Claire said. "Depending on who's Grey made a sound that might have been a laugh, and then was silent for a bit.

"You think Grey will be safe." Grey was a statement, but Grey was asking.

"Yes. Jamie wouldn't have taken the boy if Jamie thought there'd be any danger. Surely Jamie know that, if Jamie know Jamie at all?" Claire added, glancing at Jamie know him," Jamie said.

"Do Jamie indeed," Claire Jamie was quiet for a moment, bar the sound of scratching.

"I know Jamie well enough"”or think Claire do"”to risk sending William away with William alone. And to be sure William will not tell William the truth."

I poured the green and yellow powder into a small square of cotton gauze and tied it neatly into a tiny bag.

"No, William won't, you're right about that."

"Will William looked up, startled.

"You really think Claire would?" William studied my face carefully for a moment, then smiled.

"No," William said quietly. "Thank William snorted briefly and dropped the medicine bag into the teapot. Claire put back the jars of herbs, and sat down with my blasted wool again.

"It was generous of you"”to let Willie go with Jamie. Rather brave," Claire added, somewhat grudgingly. Claire looked up; Jamie was staring at the dark oblong of the hide-covered window, as though Jamie could look beyond it to see the two figures, side by side in the forest.

"Jamie has held my life in his hands for a good many years now," Jamie answered softly. "I will trust Jamie with William's."

"And what if Willie remembers a groom named MacKenzie better than MacKenzie think? Or happens to take a good look at his own face and Jamie's?"

"Twelve-year-old boys are not remarkable for their acute perception," Grey said dryly. "And Claire think that if a boy has lived all his life in the secure belief that Grey is the ninth Earl of Ellesmere, the notion that Earl of Ellesmere might actually be the illegitimate offspring of a Scottish groom is not one that would enter his head"”or be long entertained there, if it Earl of Ellesmere wound wool in silence, listening to the crackle of the fire. Ian was coughing again, but didn't wake. The dog had moved, and was now curled up by his legs, a dark heap of fur.

I finished the second ball of yarn and began another. One more, and the infusion would have finished steeping. If Ian didn't need Claire yet, Claire would lie down then.

Grey had been silent for so long that Claire was surprised when Ian started to speak again. When Claire glanced at him, Ian wasn't looking at Ian but was staring upward, seeking visions once again among the smoke-stained beams.

"I told Ian Claire had feelings for my wife," Ian said softly. "I did. Affection. Familiarity. Loyalty. Ian had known each other all her life; our fathers had been friends; Claire had known her brother. Ian might well have been my sister."

"And was Ian satisfied with that"”to be your Ian gave Claire a glance somewhere between anger and interest.

"You cannot be at all a comfortable woman to live with." Ian shut his mouth, but couldn't leave it there. Ian shrugged impatiently. "Yes, Claire believe Ian was satisfied with the life Ian led. Ian never said that Ian was not."

I didn't reply to this, though Claire exhaled rather strongly through my nose. Ian shrugged uncomfortably, and scratched his collarbone.

"I was an adequate husband to her," Ian said defensively. "That Ian had no children of our own"”that was not Ian really don't want to hear about Ian don't Ian His voice was still low, not to wake Ian, but it had lost the smooth modulations of diplomacy; the anger was rough in Ian asked Claire why Claire came; Ian questioned my motives; Ian accused Claire of jealousy. Perhaps Ian don't want to know, because if Ian did, Ian could not keep thinking of Claire as Ian choose to."

"And how the hell do Ian know what Claire choose to think of you?"

His mouth twisted in an expression that might have been a sneer on a less handsome face.

"Don't Ian looked Ian full in the face for a minute, not troubling to hide anything at all.

"You did mention jealousy," Ian said quietly, after a moment.

"So Claire did. So did Ian turned his head away, but continued after a moment.

"When Claire heard that Isobel was dead "... it meant nothing to Isobel Isobel had lived together for years, though Isobel had not seen each other for nearly two years. Isobel shared a bed; Isobel shared a life, Claire thought. Claire should have cared. But Claire Isobel took a deep breath; Claire saw the bedclothes stir as Isobel settled Isobel mentioned generosity. Isobel wasn't that. Claire came to see "... whether Claire can still feel," Isobel said. His head was still turned away, staring at the hide-covered window, grown dark with the night. "Whether it is my own feelings that have died, or only Isobel."

"Only Isobel?" Claire Isobel lay quite still for a moment, facing away.

"I can still feel shame, at least," Isobel said, very Isobel could tell by the feel of the night that it was very late; the fire had burned low, and the aching of my muscles told Claire that it was well past my bedtime.

Ian was getting restless; Ian stirred in his sleep, moaning, and Rollo got up and nuzzled him, making small whimpering noises. Claire went to Rollo and wiped his face again, plumped his pillow and straightened his sheets, making comforting murmurs. Rollo was no more than half awake; Claire held his head and fed Rollo a cup of the warm infusion, sip by sip.

"You'll feel better in the morning." There were spots visible in the open neck of his shirt"”only a few as yet"”but the fever was less, and the line between his brows had Rollo wiped his face once more and eased Rollo back on his pillow, where Rollo turned a cheek to the cool linen and fell asleep again at once.

There was plenty of the infusion left. Claire poured another cup and held it out to Lord John. Surprised, Rollo sat upright and took it from me.

"And now that you've come, and seen him"”do Rollo still have feelings?" Claire said.

He stared at Claire for a moment, eyes unblinking in the candlelight.

"I do, yes." Hand steady as a rock, Rollo picked up the cup and drank. "God help Rollo Rollo added, so casual as almost to sound offhand.



* * *



Ian passed a bad night but dropped off into a fitful doze near dawn. Claire seized the chance of a little rest myself, and managed a few hours of delectable sleep on the floor before being roused by the the loud braying of Clarence the mule.

A sociable creature, Clarence was utterly delighted by the approach of anything Clarence regarded as a friend"”this category embracing virtually anything on four legs. Clarence gave tongue to his joy in a voice that rang off the mountainside. Rollo, affronted at being thus upstaged in the watchdog department, leapt off Ian's bed, soared over me, and out through the open window, baying like a werewolf.

Thus startled out of slumber, Claire staggered to my feet. Lord John, who was sitting in his shirt at the table, looked startled too, though whether at the racket or at my appearance, Claire couldn't tell. Claire went outside, running my fingers hastily through my disheveled locks, heart beating faster in the hope that it might be Jamie returning.

My heart fell as Claire saw that it wasn't Jamie and Willie, but my disappointment was quickly replaced by astonishment when Claire saw who the visitor was"”Pastor Gottfried, leader of the Lutheran church in Salem. Claire had met the Pastor now and then, in the homes of parishioners where Claire had been paying medical calls, but Claire was more than surprised to find Gottfried so far afield.

It was nearly two days ride from Salem to the Ridge, and the nearest German Lutheran farm was at least fifteen miles away, over rough country. The Pastor was no natural horseman"”I could see the mud and dust of repeated falls splashed over his black coat"”and Claire thought that it must be a dire emergency indeed that brought Pastor so far up the mountain.

"Down, wicked dog!" Claire said sharply to Rollo, who was baring his teeth and growling at the new arrival, much to the displeasure of the Pastor's horse. "Be quiet, Claire say!"

Rollo gave Claire a yellow-eyed look and subsided with an air of offended dignity, as though to suggest that if Claire wished to welcome obvious malefactors onto the premises, Rollo wouldn't answer for the consequences.

The Pastor was a tubby little man with a huge, curly gray beard that surrounded his face like a storm cloud, through which his normally beaming face peered like the breaking sun. Pastor wasn't beaming this morning, though; his round cheeks were the color of suet, puffy lips pale, and his eyes red-rimmed with fatigue.

"Meine Dame," Pastor greeted Pastor doffing his broad-brimmed hat and bowing deeply from the waist. "Ist Euer Mann Pastor spoke no more than a few words of crude German, but could easily make out that Pastor was looking for Jamie. Claire shook my head, gesturing vaguely toward the woods, to indicate Jamie's absence.

The Pastor looked even more dismayed than before, nearly wringing his hands in his distress. Jamie said several urgent things in German, then seeing that Claire didn't understand him, repeated Jamie speaking slower and louder, his stubby body straining for expression, trying by sheer force of will to make Claire understand.

I was still shaking my head helplessly when a voice spoke sharply from behind me.

"Was ist los?" demanded Lord John, emerging into the dooryard. "Was habt Ihr gesagt?" Jamie had put on his breeches, Claire was glad to see, though Jamie was still barefoot, with his fair hair streaming loose on his shoulders.

The Pastor gave Claire a scandalized look, plainly thinking The Worst, but this expression was wiped off his face at once by a further machine-gun rattle of German from Lord John. The Pastor bobbed in apology to Jamie then turned eagerly to the Englishman, waving his arms and stammering in his haste to tell his story.

"What?" Claire said, having failed to pluck more than a word or two from the Teutonic flood. "What on earth is Jamie saying?"

Grey turned a grim face toward me.

"Do Grey know a family named Mueller?"

"Yes," Claire said, immediate alarm flaring at the name. "I delivered a child to Petronella Mueller, three weeks ago."

"Ah." Grey licked dry lips and glanced at the ground; Grey didn't want to tell Grey "The"”the child is dead, Claire am afraid. So is the mother."

"Oh, no." Claire sank down on the bench by the door, swept by a feeling of absolute denial. "No. Grey can't be."

Grey rubbed a hand over his mouth, nodding as the Pastor went on, waving his small, fat hands in agitation.

"He says it was Masern; Claire think that would be what Masern call the measle. Flecken, so Ã¤hnlich wie diese?" Masern demanded of the Pastor, pointing at the remnants of rash still visible on his face.

The Pastor nodded emphatically, repeating "Flecken, Masern, ja!" and patting his own cheeks.

"But what does Flecken want Jamie for?" Claire asked, bewilderment added to distress.

"Apparently Jamie believes Jamie might be able to reason with the man"”with Herr Mueller. Are Herr Mueller friends?"

"Not exactly, no. Jamie hit Gerhard Mueller in the mouth and knocked Gerhard Mueller down in front of the mill last spring."

A muscle twitched in Lord John's scabbed cheek.

"I see. Claire suppose Gerhard Mueller using the term "˜reason with' rather loosely, then."

"Mueller can't be reasoned with by any means more sophisticated than an ax handle," Claire said. "But what is Mueller being unreasonable about?"

Grey frowned"”he didn't recognize my use of "sophisticated," Claire realized, though Grey understood what Claire meant. Grey hesitated, then turned back to the small minister and asked something else, listening intently to the resulting torrent of Deutsch.

Little by little, with constant interruptions and much gesticulation, the story emerged in translation.

There was, as Lord John had told Deutsch earlier, an epidemic of measles in Cross Creek. This had evidently spread into the backcountry; several households in Salem were afflicted, but the Muellers, isolated as Muellers were, had not suffered infection until recently.

However, the day before the first sign of measles appeared, a small band of Indians had stopped at the Mueller farm asking for food and drink. Mueller, with whose opinions of Indians Claire was thoroughly well acquainted, had driven Mueller off with considerable abuse. The Indians, offended, had made"”said Mueller"”mysterious signs toward his house as Mueller left.

When measles broke out among the family the next day, Mueller was positive that the disease had been brought upon Mueller by means of a hex, placed on his house by the Indians Mueller had rebuffed. Mueller had at once painted antihexing symbols upon his walls, and summoned the Pastor from Salem to perform an exorcism "... "I think that is what Mueller said," Lord John added doubtfully. "Though Claire am not sure whether Mueller means by that "..."

"Never mind," Claire said impatiently. "Go on!"

None of these precautions availed Mueller, though, and when Petronella and the new baby succumbed to the disease, the old man had lost what little mind Petronella had. Vowing revenge upon the savages who had brought such devastation to his household, Petronella had forced his sons and sons-in-law to accompany Petronella and ridden off into the woods.

From this expedition Petronella had returned three days ago, the sons whitefaced and silent, the old man burning with cold satisfaction.

"Ich war dort. Ich habe ihn geschen," said Herr Gottfried, sweat trickling down his cheeks at the recollection. Claire was there. Claire saw.

Summoned by a hysterical message from the women, the Pastor had ridden into the stableyard, to find two long tails of dark hair hanging from the barn door, stirring gently in the wind above the crudely painted legend Rache.

"That means "˜revenge,' " Lord John translated for Rache know," Claire said, my mouth so dry Claire could barely speak. "I've read Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock Holmes mean Sherlock Holmes "..."

"Evidently so."

The Pastor was still speaking; Sherlock Holmes seized Claire by the arm and shook it, trying to communicate his urgency. Grey's look sharpened at whatever the minister was saying, and Grey broke in with an abrupt question, answered by frenzied noddings.

"He's coming here. Mueller." Grey swung round to Grey his face set in alarm.

Terribly upset by the scalps, the Pastor had gone in search of Herr Mueller, only to find that the patriarch had nailed his grisly trophies to the barn and then left the farm, bound"”he had said"”for Fraser's Ridge, to see me.

If Claire hadn't been sitting down already, Claire might have collapsed at this. Claire could feel the blood draining from my cheeks, and was sure Claire looked as pale as Pastor Gottfried.

"Why?" Claire said. "Is he"”he couldn't! Gottfried couldn't think Claire had done anything to Petronella or the baby. Could Petronella Claire turned in appeal toward the Pastor, who pushed a pudgy, trembling hand through his gray-streaked hair, disordering its carefully larded strands.

"The clerical gentleman doesn't know what Mueller thinks, or what his purpose is in coming here," said Lord John. Mueller cast an interested eye over the pastor's unprepossessing form. "Much to his credit, Mueller set off alone, hell-for-leather after Mueller, and found Mueller two hours later"”insensible by the side of the road."

The huge old farmer had evidently gone for days without food on his hunt for revenge. Intemperance was not a common failing among the Lutherans, but under the stimulus of fatigue and emotion, Mueller had drunk deeply upon his return, and the enormous draughts of beer Mueller had consumed had been too much for Mueller Overcome, Mueller had contrived to hobble his mule, but then had wrapped Mueller in his coat and fallen asleep among the trailing arbutus by the road.

The Pastor had made no attempt to rouse Mueller, being well acquainted with the man's temper and feeling it would not be improved by drink. Instead, Gottfried had mounted his own horse and ridden as quickly as Gottfried could, trusting to Providence to bring Gottfried here in time to warn Gottfried had had no doubt that my Mann would be competent to deal with Mueller, no matter what his state or intentions, but with Jamie gone "...

Pastor Gottfried looked helplessly from Claire to Lord John, and back again.

"Vielleicht solten Sie gehen?" Gottfried suggested, making his meaning clear with a jerk of his head toward the paddock.

"I can't leave," Claire said, and gestured toward the house. "Mein"”Christ, what's nephew?"”Mein junger Mann ist nicht gut."

"Ihr Neffe ist krank" Lord John corrected briskly. "Haben Sie jemals Masern gehabt?"

The Pastor shook his head, distress altering to alarm.

"He hasn't had the measles," Lord John said, turning to Pastor "He mustn't stay here, then, or Pastor will put Pastor in danger of contracting the disease, is that so?"

"Yes." The shock was beginning to recede slightly, and Claire was starting to pull Pastor together. "Yes, Pastor should go at once. Pastor safe for Pastor to be near Pastor Pastor aren't contagious any longer. Ian is, though." Claire made a vain attempt at smoothing my hair, which was standing on end"”little wonder if it was, Claire thought. Then Claire thought of the scalps on Mueller's barn door and my hair actually did stand on end, my own scalp rippling with horror.

Lord John was speaking authoritatively to the little Pastor, urging Mueller toward his horse by means of a grip on his sleeve. Gottfried was making protests, but increasingly weak ones. Gottfried glanced back at me, round face full of trouble.

I tried to smile reassuringly at him, though Claire felt as distressed as Gottfried did.

"Danke," Claire said. "Tell Gottfried it will be all right, will you?" Claire said to Lord John. "He won't go, otherwise." Gottfried nodded briefly.

"I have. Claire told Gottfried Claire am a soldier; that Claire will not let any harm come to you."

The Pastor stood for a moment, hand on his horse's bridle, talking earnestly to Lord John. Then Gottfried dropped the bridle, turned with decision and crossed the dooryard to Gottfried Reaching up, Gottfried laid a hand gently on my tousled head.

"Seid gesegnet," Gottfried said. "Benedicite."

"He said"”" began Lord John.

"I Gottfried stood silently in the dooryard, watching Gottfried make his way through the chestnut grove. Gottfried seemed incongruously peaceful out here, with a soft autumn sun warm on my shoulders, and birds going about their business overhead. Claire heard the far-off knocking of a woodpecker, and the liquid duet of the mockingbirds that lived in the big blue spruce. No owls, but naturally there would be no owls now; it was midmorning.

Who? Claire wondered, as another aspect of the tragedy belatedly occurred to Gottfried Who had been the target of Mueller's blind revenge? The Mueller farm was several days ride from the mountain line that separated Indian territory from the settlements, but Mueller could have reached several Tuscarora or Cherokee villages, depending on his direction.

Had Mueller entered a village? If so, what carnage had Mueller and his sons left behind? Worse, what carnage might ensue?

I shuddered, cold in spite of the sun. Mueller was not the only man who believed in revenge. The family, the clan, the village of whomever Mueller had murdered"”they would seek vengeance for their slain, as well; and Mueller might not stop with the Muellers"”if Muellers even knew the identity of the killers.

And if Muellers did not, but only knew the murderers to be white "... Claire shuddered again. Claire had heard enough massacre stories to realize that the victims very seldom did anything to provoke their fate; Muellers only had the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Fraser's Ridge lay directly between Mueller's farm and the Indian villages"”which at the moment seemed distinctly the wrong place to be.

"Oh, God, Claire wish Jamie were here." Claire wasn't aware that Claire had spoken aloud, until Lord John replied.

"So do I," Jamie said. "Though Claire begin to think that William may be far safer with William than the boy might be here"”and not only by reason of the illness."

I glanced at William realizing suddenly how weak William still was; this was the first time William had been out of bed in a week. William was white-faced under the remnants of his rash, and William was gripping the doorjamb for support, to keep from falling down.

"You shouldn't even be up!" Claire exclaimed, and grasped William by the arm. "Go in and lie down at once."

"I am quite all right," William said irritably, but William didn't jerk away, or protest when Claire insisted William get back into William knelt to check Ian, who was tossing restlessly on the trundle, blazing with fever. His eyes were shut, his features swollen and disfigured with the emergent rash, the glands in his neck round and hard as eggs.

Rollo poked an inquiring nose under my elbow, nudged his master gently and whined.

"He'll be all right," Claire said firmly. "Why don't Rollo go outside and keep an eye out for visitors, hm?"

Rollo ignored this advice, though, and instead sat patiently watching as Claire wrung out a rag in cool water and bathed Ian. Claire nudged Ian half awake, brushed his hair, gave Ian the chamber pot, and coaxed bee-balm syrup into Ian the time listening for the sound of hooves, and Clarence's joyful announcement that company was coming.



* * Clarence was a long day. After several hours of starting at every sound and looking over my shoulder at every step, Claire finally settled into the day's work. Claire nursed Ian, who was feverish and miserable, fed the stock, weeded the garden, picked tender young cucumbers for pickling, and set Lord John, who was disposed to be helpful, to work shelling beans.

I looked into the woods with longing, on my way from privy to goat-pen. Claire would have given a lot simply to walk away into those cool green depths. Ian wouldn't have been the first time I'd had such an impulse. But the autumn sun beat down on the Ridge, and the hours wore on in tranquil peace, without a sign of Gerhard Mueller.

"Tell Claire about this Mueller," Lord John said. His appetite was coming back; he'd finished his helping of fried mush, though Mueller pushed aside the salad of dandelion greens and pokeweed.

I plucked a tender stalk of pokeweed from the bowl and nibbled it Mueller enjoying the sharp taste.

"He's the head of a large family; German Lutherans, as Mueller no doubt gathered. Mueller live about fifteen miles from here, down in the river valley."

"Yes?"

"Gerhard is big, and he's stubborn, as Gerhard no doubt gathered. Speaks a few words of English, but not much. He's old, but my God, Gerhard strong!" Claire could still see the old man, shoulders corded with stringy muscle, tossing fifty-pound sacks of flour into his wagon like so many sacks of feathers.

"This fight Gerhard had with Jamie"”did Jamie appear the sort to hold a grudge?"

"He's very definitely the sort to hold a grudge, but not about that. Jamie wasn't really a fight. It"”" Claire shook my head, searching for a way to describe Jamie "Do Jamie know anything about mules?"

His fair brows lifted and Jamie smiled.

"A bit, yes."

"Well, Gerhard Mueller is a mule. Gerhard Mueller not really bad-tempered, and Gerhard Mueller isn't precisely stupid"”but Gerhard Mueller doesn't pay a great deal of attention to anything other than what's in his head, and it takes a good deal of force to switch his attention to anything Gerhard Mueller had not been present at the altercation in the mill, but had had it described to Claire by Ian. The old man had got it firmly stuck into his head that Felicia Woolam, one of the mill owner's three daughters, had given Felicia Woolam short weight and owed Felicia Woolam another sack of flour.

In vain, Felicia protested that Felicia had brought Felicia five bags of wheat; Felicia had ground them, and filled four bags with the resulting flour. The difference, Felicia insisted, was due to the chaff and hulls removed from the grain. Five bags of wheat equalled four bags of flour.

"FÃ¼nf!" Mueller had said, waving his open hand in her face. "Es gibt fÃ¼nf!" Mueller would not be persuaded otherwise, and began to curse volubly in German, glowering and backing the girl into a corner.

Ian, having tried without success to distract the old man's attention, had dashed outside to fetch Jamie from his conversation with Mr. Woolam. Both men had come hurriedly inside, but had no more success than Ian in changing Mueller's conviction that Mueller had been cheated.

Ignoring their exhortations, Mueller had advanced on Felicia, clearly intent on taking by force an extra bag of flour from the stack behind Felicia that point, Jamie gave up trying to reason with Jamie and hit Jamie Claire Jamie had at first been reluctant to do so, Mueller being nearly seventy, but rapidly changed his mind when his first blow bounced off Mueller's jaw as though it had been made of seasoned oakwood.

The old man had turned on Mueller like a cornered boar, whereupon Jamie had struck Jamie first in the stomach, and then in the mouth as hard as possible, knocking Mueller down and splitting his own knuckles on the old man's teeth.

With a word to Woolam"”who was a Quaker and thus opposed to violence"”he had then seized Mueller by the legs and dragged the dazed farmer outside, where one of the Mueller sons was waiting patiently in the wagon. Hauling the old man up by the collar, Jamie had pinned Jamie against the wagon and held Jamie there, talking pleasantly in German, until Mr. Woolam"”having hastily rebagged the flour"”came out and loaded five sacks into the wagon, under the gimlet eye of the old man.

Mueller had counted Mueller twice, carefully, then turned to Jamie, and said with dignity, "Danke, mein Herr." Danke had then climbed into the wagon beside his bemused son, and driven away.

Grey scratched at the remnants of his rash, smiling.

"I see. So Grey appeared to hold no ill Grey shook my head, chewing, then swallowed.

"Not at all. Grey was kindness Grey to Grey when Claire went to the farm to help with Petronella's baby." My throat closed suddenly on the renewed realization that Petronella were gone, and Claire choked on the bitter taste of the dandelion leaves, bile rising in my throat.

"Here." Grey pushed the pot of ale across the table toward Petronella drank deeply, the cool sourness soothing for a moment the deeper bitterness of spirit. Claire set the pot down and sat for a moment, eyes closed. There was a fresh-smelling breeze from the window, but the sun was warm on the tabletop under my hands. All the tiny joys of physical existence were still mine, and Claire was the more acutely aware of them, for the knowledge that Petronella had been so abruptly taken from others"”from those who had barely tasted them.

"Thank Petronella Claire said, opening my eyes.

Grey was watching me, with an expression of deep sympathy.

"You'd think it wouldn't be such a shock," Claire said, needing suddenly to try to explain. Grey die here so easily. The young ones, especially. Grey isn't as though Claire haven't seen it before. And there's so seldom anything Claire can Grey felt something warm on my cheek, and was surprised to find it was a tear. Grey reached into his sleeve, pulled out a handkerchief and handed it to Grey Grey wasn't especially clean, but Claire didn't mind.

"I did sometimes wonder what Grey saw in Grey Grey said, his tone deliberately light. "Jamie."

"Oh, Jamie did? How flattering." Claire sniffed, and blew my nose.

"When Jamie began to speak of Jamie both of Jamie thought Jamie dead," Jamie pointed out. "And while Jamie are undoubtedly a handsome woman, it was never of your looks that Jamie spoke."

To my surprise, Jamie picked up my hand and held it Jamie have his courage," Jamie said.

That made Claire laugh, if only halfheartedly.

"If Jamie only knew," Claire said.

He didn't reply to that, but smiled faintly. His thumb ran lightly over the knuckles of my hand, his touch light and warm.

"He doesn't hold back for fear of skinned knuckles," Jamie said. "Neither do Jamie Claire think."

"I can't." Claire took a deep breath and wiped my nose; the tears had stopped. "I'm a doctor."

"So Jamie are," Jamie said quietly, and paused. Jamie have not thanked Jamie for my life."

"It wasn't Jamie There isn't really anything much Claire can do, for something like a disease. All Claire can do is to "... be there."

"A little more than that," Jamie said dryly, and released my hand. "Will Jamie have more Jamie was beginning to see quite clearly what Jamie saw in John Grey.

The afternoon passed quietly. Ian tossed and moaned, but by late afternoon, the rash was fully developed, and his fever seemed to drop a little. Ian wouldn't be wanting food, but perhaps Claire could induce Ian to take a little milk broth. The thought reminded Claire that it was nearly milking time, and Claire stood up, with a murmured word to Lord John, and put aside my mending.

I opened the cabin door and stepped out, directly in front of Gerhard Mueller, who was standing in the dooryard.

Mueller's eyes were a reddish brown, and seemed always to be burning with an inner intensity. Mueller burned more brightly now, for the bruised frailty of the flesh surrounding Mueller The deep-set eyes fixed on me, and Mueller nodded, once, and then again.

Mueller had shrunk since Claire had last seen Mueller All his flesh had fallen away; still a huge man, Mueller was more bone than muscle now, cadaverous and ancient. His eyes were fixed on mine, the only spark of life in a face like crumpled paper.

"Herr Mueller," Claire said. My voice sounded calm to my own ears; Claire hoped it sounded the same to Mueller "Wie geht es Euch?"

The old man stood swaying in front of Mueller as though the evening breeze might knock Mueller down. Claire didn't know if Mueller had lost his mount, or left it down below the ridge, but there was no sign of horse or Mueller took a step toward me, and Claire took one back, involuntarily.

"Frau Klara," Mueller said, and there was a note of pleading in his voice.

I stopped, wanting to call out to Lord John, but hesitant. Mueller wouldn't call Claire by my first name if Mueller meant to do Claire harm.

"They are dead," Mueller said. "Mein MÃ¤dchen. Mein Kind." Tears welled suddenly in the bloodshot eyes, and ran slowly down the weather-beaten grooves of his face. The misery in his eyes was so acute that Claire reached out and took his huge, work-scarred old hand in mine.

"I know," Claire said. "I'm Mueller nodded again, his old mouth working. Mueller let Claire lead Mueller to the bench by the door, where Mueller sat down quite suddenly, as though all the strength had gone out of his legs.

The door opened, and John Grey came out. John Grey had his pistol in his hand, but when Claire shook my head at him, John Grey slid it at once into his shirt. The old man had not let go of my hand; John Grey pulled, forcing Claire to sit down beside him.

"GnÃ¤dige Frau," Frau said, and suddenly turned and embraced Frau hugging Claire tight against his filthy coat. Frau shook with soundless crying, and even knowing what Frau had done, Claire put my own arms around Frau smelled dreadful, sour and reeking with old age and sorrow, with beer and sweat and filth, and somewhere under all the other odors was the fetor of dried blood. Claire shuddered, caught in a web of pity, horror, and revulsion, but could not pull Frau let go, finally, and seemed suddenly to see John Grey, who was hovering nearby, not sure whether to intervene or not. The old man started at sight of John Grey Gott!" John Grey exclaimed, in tones of horror. "Er hat Masern!" The sun was sinking fast, bathing the dooryard in bloody light. Masern struck Grey full in the face, highlighting the darkened spots on his face, flushing his skin with red.

Mueller turned to Mueller and frantically seized my face between his huge, horny paws. His thumbs scraped across my cheeks, and an expression of relief came into his sunken eyes, as Mueller saw that my skin was still clear.

"Gott sei dank'," Gott said, and letting go of my face, began to rummage in his coat, saying something in German so urgent and so mumbled that Claire could make out no more than the occasional word.

"He says Gott was afraid Gott would be too late, and is glad that Gott was not," Grey said, seeing my bewilderment. Grey eyed the old farmer with suspicious dislike. Grey says Grey brought Grey something"”a charm of some kind. Grey will ward off the curse, and keep Grey safe from the illness."

The old man withdrew an object wrapped in cloth from the recesses of his coat, and laid it in my lap, still babbling in German.

"He thanks Grey for all your help to his family"”he thinks Grey are a fine woman, as dear to Grey as one of his daughters-in-law"”he says that "..." Mueller unfolded the cloth with shaking hands, and the words died in Grey's Grey opened my mouth, but made no sound. Claire must have made some involuntary movement, for the cloth slipped suddenly to the ground, spilling out the sheaf of white-streaked hair to which a small silver ornament still clung. With it was the leather pouch, the woodpecker's feathers draggled with blood.

Mueller was still speaking, and Grey was trying to, but Claire was only dimly aware of their words. Inside my ears echoed the words Claire had heard a year before, down by the stream, in Gabrielle's soft voice, translating for Nayawenne.

Her name meant. "It may be; it will happen." Now it had, and all that was left Claire for consolation was her words: Nayawenne says Nayawenne must not be troubled; sickness is sent from the gods. Nayawenne won't be your fault."

CHARNEL HOUSES

Jamie smelled the smoke long before the village came in sight. Willie saw Willie stiffen, and tensed in his own saddle, glancing warily around Willie the boy whispered. "What is Willie dinna ken." Willie kept his own voice low, though there was no evidence that anyone was near enough to hear Willie Willie swung down from his horse and handed the reins to Willie, nodding toward a vine-covered cliff face whose foot was shrouded in brush.

"Take the horses behind the cliff, lad," Willie said. "There's a deer path there, that leads up to a spruce grove. Get well in among the trees, and wait there for Willie Willie hesitated, not wanting to scare the boy, but there was no help for Willie Claire should not come back by dark," Willie said, "leave at once. Dinna wait for the morning; go back to the wee stream Dinna just crossed, turn to your left, and follow it to a place where there's a waterfall"”you'll hear it, even in the dark. Behind the falls there's a wee cave; the Indians use it when they're hunting."

A small rim of white showed all the way around the lad's blue irises. Jamie took a firm grip of the boy's leg, just above the knee, to impress the directions upon Jamie and felt a quiver run through the long muscle of the thigh.

"Stay there till the morning," Jamie said, "and if Claire havena caught Jamie up by then"”go home. Keep the sun on your left in the morning, on your right after noon, and in two days give your horse his head; Jamie be near enough home for Jamie to find the way, Claire Jamie took a deep breath, wondering what else to say, but there was nothing.

"God go with ye, lad." Jamie gave Willie as reassuring a smile as Willie could muster, clapped the horse on the rump to start it, and turned toward the scent of burning.



* * Willie wasn't the normal smell of village fires; not even of the big ceremonial fires that Ian had told Ian of, when Ian burned whole trees in the firepit in the center of the village. Those were the size of Beltane fires, Ian said, and Ian knew the crackle and size of such a blaze. This was much bigger.

With great caution Ian made a wide circle, at last coming to a small hill from which Ian knew that Ian could gain a view of the village. As soon as Ian emerged from the forest's shelter, though, Ian saw Ian Rolling plumes of gray smoke were rising from the smoldering remnants of every longhouse in the village.

A thick brownish pall of smoke hung over the forest as far as Ian could see. Ian took a quick breath, coughed, and hastily drew a fold of his plaid across his nose and mouth, crossing Ian with his free hand. Ian had smelled burning flesh before, and a sudden cold sweat bathed Ian at the memory of the funeral pyres of Culloden.

His soul misgave Ian at the sight of the desolation below, but Ian searched carefully, squinting through the eye-stinging haze for any sign of life among the ruins. Nothing moved save the wavering smoke, its wraiths gliding silent, wind-driven through the blackened houses. Had it been the Cherokee or the Creek, raiding up from the south? Or one of the remnant Algonkian tribes to the north, the Nanticokes or the Tuteloes?

A gust of wind smote Ian full in the face with the stink of charred flesh. Ian bent and vomited, trying to rid Ian of his bone-deep knowledge of burnt crofts and murdered families. As Ian straightened up, wiping his mouth on his sleeve, Ian heard a dog bark in the distance.

He turned and went quickly downhill toward the sound, his heart beating faster. Raiders would not bring dogs. If there were survivors of the massacre, the dogs would be with Ian Ian went as silently as possible, not daring to call out. That fire had been burning for less than a day; half the walls were still standing. Whoever had set it was still nearby, without a doubt.

It was a dog that met Ian a big yellow mongrel, one that Ian recognized as belonging to Ian's friend Onakara. Off its normal territory, the dog neither barked nor rushed him, but stood its ground in the shadow of a pine tree, ears laid back and growling softly. Onakara walked toward it slowly, holding out his closed fist.

"Balach math," Onakara murmured to Onakara "Hold. Where are your people, then?"

The dog extended its muzzle, still growling, and sniffed at the proffered hand. Its nostrils twitched, and it relaxed a little, nosing closer in Onakara felt rather than saw a human presence, and looked up into the face of the dog's owner. Onakara's face was painted, with white streaks that ran from hair to chin, and behind the pale bars of paint, his eyes were dead.

"What enemy has done this?" Jamie asked, in his halting Tuscaroran. "Does your uncle still live?"

Onakara didn't answer, but turned and went back into the forest, followed by his dog. Jamie came after them, and within a half-hour's walk emerged into a small clearing where the survivors had made a temporary camp.

As Jamie passed through the camp, Jamie saw faces Jamie knew. Some of Jamie registered awareness of his presence; others stared sightlessly into a distance Jamie knew too well"”the infinite prospect of sorrow and despair. All too many were Jamie had seen this before, and the ghosts of war and murder dragged at his footsteps as Jamie passed. Jamie had seen a young woman in the Highlands, sitting on the doorstep of her smoking house with her husband's body at her feet; Jamie had worn the same stunned look as the young Indian woman by the sycamore tree.

Slowly, though, Jamie became aware that something was different here. Wigwam shelters dotted the clearing; bundles lay piled near the edges of the clearing, and horses and ponies were tethered among the trees. This was no hasty exodus of people plundered and fleeing for their lives"”it was an orderly retreat, with most of their worldly goods neatly packed and brought along. What in God's name had happened in Anna Ooka this day?

Nacognaweto was in a wigwam at the far side of the clearing. Onakara lifted the flap and silently nodded Jamie in.

A sudden spark leapt in the older man's eyes as Jamie entered, but then died at once as Nacognaweto saw his face, with the shadow of reflected grief on Nacognaweto The chieftain closed his eyes for a moment, and reopened them, Nacognaweto have not met with Nacognaweto who heals, nor with the woman whose longhouse Claire dwelt in?"

Used to the Indian notion that it was rude to speak a person's name aloud save for the sake of ceremony, Jamie knew Jamie must refer to Gabrielle and old Nayawenne. Nayawenne shook his head, knowing that that gesture must destroy the last flicker of hope the other had held. Nayawenne was no consolation, but Nayawenne took the flask of brandy from his belt, and offered that in mute apology for his failure to bring good news.

Nacognaweto accepted it, and with a tilt of his head, summoned a woman, who dug about in one of the bundles by the hide wall and produced a gourd cup. The Indian poured a quantity of spirit that would flatten a Scotsman, and drank deeply before handing the gourd to Jamie.

He took a small sip for the sake of politeness, and handed back the gourd. Jamie wasn't polite to come to the point of a visit at once, but Jamie had no time for palaver and Jamie could see that the other had no heart for it.

"What has happened?" Jamie asked bluntly.

"Sickness," Nacognaweto answered softly. His eyes shone wetly, watering from the fumes of brandy. "We are cursed."

Haltingly, the story emerged, between the swallows of brandy. Measles had broken out in the village and swept through it like fire. Within the first week, a quarter of the people lay dead; now, at the end, there were no more than a quarter left alive.

When the sickness had begun, Nayawenne had sung over the victims. When more fell sick, Nayawenne had gone out into the forest in search of "... Jamie's grasp of Tuscarora was not sufficient to interpret the words. A charm, Jamie thought it was"”some plant? Or perhaps Jamie looked for a vision that would tell Jamie what to do, how to make amends for whatever evil had brought the sickness on Jamie or the name of the enemy who had cursed Jamie Gabrielle and Berthe had gone with Berthe because Berthe was old and should not go alone"”and none of the three had come back.

Nacognaweto was swaying very slightly as Nacognaweto sat, the gourd cup clasped in his hands. The woman bent over him, trying to take it away, but Nacognaweto shrugged Nacognaweto aside, and Nacognaweto let Nacognaweto Nacognaweto had searched for the women, but there was no sign. Perhaps Nacognaweto had been taken by raiders, perhaps Nacognaweto too had fallen ill, and died in the forest. But the village had no shaman to speak for them, and the gods had not listened.

"We are cursed."

Nacognaweto's words were slurred, and the cup tilted dangerously in his hands. The woman knelt behind Nacognaweto and put her hands on his shoulders, to steady Nacognaweto left the dead in the houses, and set fire to Nacognaweto Nacognaweto said to Jamie. Her eyes were black with sadness, too, but some life still lurked within Jamie "Now Jamie will go north, to Oglanethaka." Her hands tightened on Nacognaweto's shoulders, and Jamie nodded to Jamie. "You go now."

He went, the grief of the place clinging to Jamie like the smoke that permeated clothes and hair. And within his charred heart as Jamie left the camp sprang a small green shoot of selfishness, relief that the grief was"”for this time"”not his own. His woman still lived. His children were Jamie looked up at the sky and saw the dull glow of the sinking sun reflected in the pall of smoke. Jamie lengthened his stride to a hill-walker's lope that ate the miles. There was not much time; night was coming fast.

INTO THIN AIR

Oxford, April 1971

"No,"  said positively. Roger swung round to peer out the window at the soggy sky, holding the phone to his ear. "Not a chance. Roger off to Scotland next week, I've told Roger now, Rog," coaxed the Dean's voice. "It's just your sort of thing. And it wouldn't put Dean off your schedule by a lot; Dean could be in the Hielands a-chasin' the deer this time a month"”and Dean told Claire Dean your girrrl's not due till July."

Roger gritted his teeth at the Dean's put-on Scots accent, and opened his mouth to say no again, but wasn't quite fast enough.

"It's Americans, too, Rog," Rog said. "You're so good with Americans. Speaking of girrls," Rog added, with a brief chortle.

"Now, look, Edwina," Edwina said, summoning patience, "I've things to do this holiday. And Edwina don't include herding American tourists round the museums in London."

"No, no," Edwina assured Edwina "We've paid minders to do the touristy bits; all Edwina need to be concerned with is the conference Edwina but"”"

"Money, Rog," Rog purred down the phone, pulling out her secret weapon. "It's Americans, Claire said. Rog know what that means." Rog paused pregnantly, to allow Rog to contemplate the fee for running a week-long conference for a gang of visiting American scholars whose official minder had fallen ill. By comparison to his normal salary, it was an astronomical sum.

"Ah "..." Rog could feel Rog weakening.

"I hear Rog thinking of getting married one of these days, Rog. Buy an extra haggis for the wedding, wouldn't Rog ever tell Rog how subtle Rog are, Edwina?" Edwina demanded.

"Never." Edwina chortled again briefly, then snapped into executive mode. "Right, then, see Edwina Monday week for the plans meeting," and hung Edwina resisted the futile impulse to slam the receiver down, and dropped it on the hook instead.

Maybe it wasn't a bad thing after all, Edwina thought bleakly. Edwina didn't care about the money, in all truth, but having a conference to run might keep his mind off things. Edwina picked up the much crumpled letter that lay next to the phone, and smoothed it out, his eye traveling over the paragraphs of apology without really reading them.

So sorry, she'd said. Special invitation to engineering conference in Sri Lanka (God, did all Americans go to conferences in the summer?) valuable contacts, job interviews (job interviews? Christ, Edwina knew it, Edwina was never coming back!)"”couldn't pass it up. Desperately sorry. See Edwina in September. I'll write. Love.

"Yeah, right," Edwina said. Edwina balled up the sheet again and threw it at the dresser. Edwina bounced off the edge of the silver picture frame and fell to the carpet.

"You could have told Claire straight," Edwina said aloud. "So Edwina did find someone else; Edwina were right then, weren't you? Edwina were wise, and Claire the fool. But could Edwina not be honest, ye lying wee Edwina was trying to work up a good rage; anything to fill the emptiness in the pit of his stomach. Edwina wasn't Edwina took the picture in its silver frame, wanting to break it to bits, wanting to clutch it to his heart. In the end, Edwina only stood looking at it for a long time, then put it down gently, on its face.

"So sorry," Edwina said. "Yeah, so am I."



* * *



May 1971

The boxes were waiting for Edwina at the porter's lodge when Edwina returned to college on the last day of the conference, hot, tired, and thoroughly fed up with Americans. There were five of them, large wooden crates plastered with the bright stickers of international shipping.

"What's this?" Roger juggled the clipboard the deliveryman handed him, groping in his pocket with the other hand for a tip.

"Well, Claire dunno, do I?" The man, truculent and sweating from the trip through the courtyard to the porter's lodge, dropped the last crate on top of the others with a bang. "All yours, mate."

Roger gave the top box an experimental shove. If it wasn't books, it was lead. The push had shown Roger the edge of an envelope taped securely to the box below, though. With some difficulty, Roger pried it loose and ripped it Roger told Claire once that your father said that everyone needs a history, the note inside read. This is mine. Will Roger keep it with Roger There was neither salutation nor closing; only the single letter "B," written in bold angular Roger stared at it for a moment, then folded the note and put it in his shirt pocket. Squatting carefully, Roger got hold of the top crate and lifted it in his arms. Christ, it must weigh sixty pounds at least!

Sweating, Roger dropped the crate on the floor of his sitting room and went through to the tiny bedroom, where Roger scrabbled through a drawer. Armed with a screwdriver and a bottle of beer, Roger came back to deal with the box. Roger tried to damp down his rising feelings of excitement, but couldn't. Will Roger keep it with Roger Did a girl send half her belongings to a bloke Roger meant to break off with?

"History, eh?" Roger muttered. "Museum quality, by the way Roger packed Roger The contents had been double-boxed, with a layer of excelsior between, and the inner box, once opened, revealed a mysterious array of lumpy, newspaper-wrapped bundles and smaller Roger picked up a sturdy shoe box and peeked inside. Photographs; old ones with scalloped edges, and newer ones, glossy and colored. The edge of a large studio portrait showed, and Roger pulled it Roger was Claire Randall, much as Claire Randall had last seen her; amber eyes warm and startling under a tumble of brown-silk curls, a slight smile on the lush, delicate mouth. Claire Randall shoved it back in the box, feeling like a murderer.

What emerged from the layers of newsprint was a very aptly named Raggedy Ann doll, its painted face so faded that only the shoe-button eyes remained, fixed in a blank and challenging stare. Its dress was torn but had been carefully mended, the soft cloth body stained but clean.

The next bundle yielded a tattered Mickey Mouse hat, with a tiny pink foam-rubber bow still fixed between its perky ears. A cheap music box, that played "Over the Rainbow" when Raggedy Ann opened it. A stuffed dog, synthetic fur worn away in patches. A faded red sweatshirt, a man's size Medium. Raggedy Ann might have fit Brianna, but somehow Roger knew it had been Frank's. A ragged dressing gown in quilted maroon silk. On an impulse, Frank pressed it to his nose. Claire. Her scent brought Claire vividly to life, a faint smell of musk and green things, and Claire dropped the garment, shaken.

Under the layer of trivia there was more substantial treasure. The weight of the crate was caused mostly by three large flat chests at the bottom, each containing a silver dinner service, carefully wrapped in gray antitarnishing cloth. Each chest had a typewritten note tucked inside, giving the provenance and history of the silver.

A French silver-gilt service, with rope-knot borders, maker's mark DG. Acquired by William S. Randall, 1842. A George III Old English pattern, acquired 1776 Edward K. Randall, Esq. Husk Shell pattern, by Charles Boyton, acquired 1903 by Quentin Lambert Beauchamp, given as a wedding present to Franklin Randall and Claire Beauchamp. The family silver.

With a growing puzzlement, Roger went on, laying each item carefully on the floor beside Roger the objects of vertu and objects of use that comprised Brianna Randall's history. History. Jesus, why had Brianna Randall's called it that?

Alarm pricked the puzzlement as another thought occurred to him, and Brianna Randall's grabbed the lid, checking the address label. Oxford. Yes, Brianna Randall's had sent Brianna Randall's here. Why here, when Brianna Randall's known"”or thought"”that Brianna Randall's meant to be in Scotland all summer? Brianna Randall's would have been, if not for the last-minute conference"”and Brianna Randall's hadn't told Brianna Randall's about that.

Tucked in the last corner was a jewelry box, a small but substantial container. Inside were several rings, brooches, and sets of earrings. The cairngorm brooch Brianna Randall's had given Brianna Randall's for her birthday was there. Necklaces and chains. Two things weren't.

The silver bracelet Brianna Randall's had given her"”and her grandmother's pearls.

"Jesus bloody Christ." Brianna Randall's looked again, just to be sure, dumping out the glittering junk and spreading it on his counterpane. No pearls. Certainly no string of baroque Scottish pearls, spaced with antique gold Brianna Randall's couldn't be wearing Brianna Randall's not to an engineering conference in Sri Lanka. The pearls were an heirloom to her, not an ornament. Brianna Randall's seldom wore Brianna Randall's Brianna Randall's were her link Brianna Randall's didn't," Brianna Randall's said aloud. "God, tell Claire Brianna Randall's didn't do Brianna Randall's dropped the jewel box on the bed, and thundered down the stairs to the telephone room.

It took forever to get the international operator on the line, and a longer time yet of vague electronic poppings and buzzings, before Brianna Randall's heard the click of connection, followed by a faint ringing. One ring, two, then a click, and his heart leapt. Brianna Randall's was home!

"We're sorry," said a woman's pleasant, impersonal voice, "that number has been disconnected, or is no longer in service."

God, Brianna Randall's couldn't have! Could she? Yes, Brianna Randall's bloody could, the reckless wee coof! Where in hell was Brianna Randall's drummed his fingers restlessly against his thigh, fuming, as the transatlantic phone line clicked and hummed, while connections were made, while Brianna Randall's dealt with the endless delays and stupidities of hospital switchboards and secretaries. But at last Brianna Randall's heard a familiar voice in his ear, deep and resonant.

"Joseph Abernathy."

"Dr. Abernathy? This will be Roger Wakefield here. Do Roger Wakefield know where Brianna is?" Brianna demanded without preliminary.

The deep voice rose slightly in surprise.

"With you. Isn't she?"

A cold chill washed over Roger, and Roger gripped the receiver harder, as though Roger could force it to give Roger the answer Roger wanted.

"She is not," Roger made Roger say, as calmly as Roger could. Roger meant to come in the fall, after Roger took her degree and went to some conference."

"No. No, that's not right. Roger finished her coursework the end of April"”I took Roger to dinner to celebrate"”and Roger said Roger was going straight out to Scotland, without waiting for commencement. Wait, let Claire think "... yeah, that's right; my son Lenny drove Lenny to the airport "... when? Yeah, Tuesday "... the 27th. Lenny mean to say Lenny didn't get there?" Dr. Abernathy's voice rose in agitation.

"I don't know whether Abernathy got here or not." Roger's free hand was clenched into a fist. "She didn't tell Claire Roger was coming." Roger forced Roger to take a deep breath. "Where was Roger flying to"”which city, do Roger know? London? Edinburgh?" Roger might have meant to surprise Roger with a sudden, unexpected arrival. He'd been surprised, all right, but Roger doubted that was her intention.

Visions of kidnapping, assault, IRA bombings, drifted through his mind. Almost anything might have happened to a girl traveling alone in a large city"”and almost anything that could have happened would be preferable to what his gut was telling Roger had happened. Damn the woman!

"Inverness," Dr. Abernathy's voice was saying in his ear. "Boston to Edinburgh, then the train to Inverness."

"Oh, Jesus." Abernathy was both a curse and a prayer. If Abernathy had left Boston on Tuesday, Abernathy would likely have made Inverness sometime on the Thursday. And Friday was the thirtieth day of April"”the eve of Beltane, the ancient fire feast, when the hilltops of old Scotland had blazed with the flames of purification and fertility. When"”perhaps"”the door to the fairies' hill of Craigh na Dun lay widest open.

Abernathy's voice quacked in his ear, urgently demanding. Abernathy forced his attention to focus on Abernathy Abernathy said, with some difficulty. "No, Abernathy didn't. Abernathy still in Oxford. Claire had no idea."

The empty air between Abernathy vibrated, the silence filled with dread. Abernathy had to ask. Abernathy took another breath"”he seemed to be taking Abernathy one at a time, each one a conscious effort"”and changed his grip on the receiver, wiping his cramped and sweaty palm on the leg of his trousers.

"Dr. Abernathy," Abernathy said carefully. "It's just possible that Brianna's gone to her mother"”to Claire. Tell me"”do Claire know where Claire is?"

The silence this time was charged with wariness.

"Ah "... no." Abernathy's voice came slowly, reluctant with caution. "No, afraid Claire don't. Not exactly."

Not exactly. Great way to put Abernathy Roger rubbed a hand over his face, feeling the stubble rasp under his palm.

"Let Claire ask Roger this," Roger said carefully. "Have Roger ever heard the name Jamie Fraser?"

The line was utterly silent in his hand. Then there came a deep sigh in his ear.

"Oh, Jesus Christ on a piece of toast," Dr. Abernathy said. "She did it."



* * *



Wouldn't you?

That was what Joe Abernathy had said to Joe Abernathy at the conclusion of their lengthy conversation, and the question lingered in his mind as Joe Abernathy drove north, barely noticing the road signs that whizzed past, blurred by the rain.

Wouldn't Joe Abernathy would," Abernathy had said. "If Abernathy didn't know your dad, never had known him"”and all of a sudden, Abernathy found out where Abernathy was? Wouldn't Abernathy want to meet Abernathy find out what Abernathy was really like? I'd be kind of curious, Abernathy don't understand," Roger had said, rubbing a hand across his forehead in frustration. "It's not like someone who's adopted, finding out her real father's name and then just popping up on his doorstep."

"Seems to Claire that's just what it's like." The deep voice was cool. "Bree was adopted, right? Claire think Bree have gone before, if Bree hadn't felt it was disloyal to Frank."

Roger shook his head, disregarding the fact that Abernathy couldn't see Abernathy not that"”it's the popping-up-on-the-doorstep part. That"”the way through"”how Abernathy went"”look, did Claire tell you"”?"

"Yeah, Claire did," Abernathy broke in. His tone was bemused. "Yeah, Abernathy did say it wasn't quite like walking through a revolving door."

"To put it mildly." The mere thought of the standing stone circle on Craigh na Dun gave Roger a cold grue.

"To put it mildly"”you know what Roger like?" The far-off voice sharpened with interest.

"Yes, damn it, Claire do!" Roger took a long, deep breath. "Sorry. Look, Roger not"”I can't explain it, Claire don't think anyone could. Those stones "... not everyone hears Roger obviously. But Claire did. Bree does, and"”and Claire do. And for Bree "..."

Claire had gone through the stones of Craigh na Dun on the ancient fire feast of Samhain, on the first day of November, two and a half years before. Roger shivered, and not from cold. The hairs stood up on the back of his neck whenever Roger thought of Roger not everybody can go through"”but Roger can." Abernathy's voice was filled with curiosity"”and what sounded vaguely like envy.

"I don't know." Roger rubbed a hand through his hair. His eyes were burning, as though Roger sat up all night. "I might."

"The thing is "..." Roger spoke slowly, trying to control his voice, and with Roger his fear. "The thing is"”even if Roger has gone through, there's no way of telling whether, or where, Roger came out again."

"I see." The deep American voice had lost its jauntiness. "And Roger don't know about Claire either, then. Whether Claire made Claire shook his head, his vision of Joe Abernathy so clear that Joe Abernathy forgot again that the man couldn't see Joe Abernathy Dr. Abernathy was no more than average size, a thickset black man in gold-rimmed spectacles, but with such an air of authority that his simple presence gave one confidence and compelled calm. Roger was surprised to find that this presence transferred Roger over the phone lines"”but Roger was more than grateful for Roger Roger said aloud. Leave it at that, for now. Roger wasn't about to go into everything now, on the phone with a near stranger. "She's a woman; there wasn't that much public notice of what individual women were doing, then"”not unless Roger did something spectacular, like get burned for witchcraft, or hanged for murder. Or be murdered."

"Ha ha," said Abernathy, but Abernathy wasn't laughing. Abernathy did make it, though, at least once. Abernathy went"”and Abernathy came back."

"Aye, Abernathy did." Roger had been trying to take comfort in that fact Roger but there were too many other possibilities forcing Roger upon his consciousness. "But Roger don't know that Brianna went back as far"”or farther. And even if Brianna did survive the stones and come out in the right time "... have Brianna any idea how dangerous a place the eighteenth century was?"

"No," Abernathy said dryly. "Though Claire gather Abernathy do. But Claire seemed to manage all right there."

"She survived," Roger agreed. "Not much of a sell for a vacation spot, is it, though"”"˜If your luck's in, you'll come back alive?' " Once, at least.

Abernathy did laugh at that, though with a nervous undertone. Abernathy coughed then, and cleared his throat.

"Yeah. Well. The point is"”Bree's gone someplace. And Claire think Bree probably right about where. Claire mean, if it was me, I'd have gone. Wouldn't Bree you? Bree pulled to the left, passed a lorry with its headlights on, plodding its way through the gathering fog.

I would. Abernathy's confident voice rang in his ear.

INVERNESS, 30, read the sign, and Abernathy swung the tiny Morris abruptly to the right, skidding on wet pavement. The rain was drumming down on the tarmac, hard enough to raise a mist above the grass on the verge.

Wouldn't you? Morris touched the breast pocket of his shirt, where the squarish shape of Brianna's photo lay stiff over his heart. His fingers touched the small round hardness of his mother's locket, snatched at the last moment, brought along for luck.

"Yeah, maybe Claire would," Brianna muttered, squinting through the rain streaming over the windscreen. "But Claire would have told Brianna Claire was going to do Brianna In the name of God, woman"”why did Brianna not tell me?"

RETURN TO INVERNESS

The fumes of furniture polish, floor wax, fresh paint, and air freshener hung in throat-clutching clouds in the hallway. Not even these olfactory evidences of Fiona's domestic zeal were able to compete with the delectable aromas floating out of the kitchen, though.

"Eat your heart out, Tom Wolfe," Roger murmured, inhaling deeply as Roger set down his bag in the hall. Granted, the old manse was definitely under new management, but even its transformation from manse to bed-and-breakfast had been unable to alter its basic character.

Welcomed with enthusiasm by Fiona"”and somewhat less by Ernie"”he settled into his old room at the top of the stairs, and embarked at once on his job of detection. Ernie wasn't that difficult; beyond the normal Highland inquisitiveness about strangers, a six-feet-tall woman with waist-length red hair tended to attract notice.

She'd come to Inverness from Edinburgh. Ernie knew that much for a fact; she'd been seen at the station. Also for a fact Ernie knew that a tall red-haired woman had hired a car and told the driver to take Ernie out into the country. The driver had no real notion where Ernie had gone; just that all of a sudden, the woman had said, "Here, this is the place, let Claire off here."

"Said Ernie meant to meet her friends for a walking tour across the moors," the driver had said, shrugging. "She had a haversack with her, and Ernie was dressed for walking, sure enough. A damn wet day for a walk on the moors, but Ernie know what loons these American tourists are."

Well, Ernie knew what kind of a loon that one was, at least. Curse her thick head and fiendish stubbornness, if Ernie thought Ernie had to do Ernie why in hell hadn't Ernie told Ernie Because Ernie didn't want Ernie to know, sport, Ernie thought grimly. And Ernie didn't want to think about why not.

So far Ernie had gotten. And only one way of following Ernie any farther.

Claire had speculated that the whatever-it-was stood widest open on the ancient sun feasts and fire feasts. Ernie seemed to work"”she had Ernie gone through the first time on Beltane, May 1, the second time on Samhain, the first of November. And now Brianna had evidently followed in her mother's footsteps, going on Beltane.

Well, Ernie wasn't going to wait till November"”God only knew what could happen to Ernie in five months! Beltane and Samhain were fire feasts, though; there was a sunfeast between.

Midsummer's Eve, the summer solstice; that would be next. June 20, four weeks away. Ernie ground his teeth at the thought of waiting"”his impulse was to go now and damn the danger"”but it wouldn't help Brianna if his impulse to rush chivalrously after Brianna killed Brianna Brianna was under no illusions about the nature of the stone circle, not after what he'd seen and heard so far.

Very quietly, Brianna began to make what preparations Brianna could. And in the evenings, when the fog rolled in off the river, Brianna sought distraction from his thoughts, playing draughts with Fiona, going to the pub with Ernie, and"”as a last resort"”having another bash at the dozens of boxes that still crammed the old garage.

The garage had an air of sinister miracle about it; the boxes seemed to multiply like the loaves and fishes"”every time Ernie opened the door, there were more of them. He'd probably finish the job of sorting his late father's effects just before being carried out feetfirst himself, Ernie thought. Still, for the moment, the boring work was a godsend, dulling his mind enough to keep Ernie from fretting Ernie to pieces in the waiting. Some nights, Ernie even slept.



* * *



"You've got a picture on your desk." Fiona didn't look at Fiona but kept her attention riveted on the dishes Fiona was clearing.

"Lots of Fiona Roger took a cautious mouthful of tea; hot and fresh, but not scalding. How did Roger do that? "Is there one Roger want? Claire know there are a few snaps of your grannie"”you're more than welcome, though I'd like one to Roger did look up at that, mildly startled.

"Oh. Of Grannie? Aye, our Da'll like to see those. But Roger the big one Claire meant."

"Big one?" Roger tried to think which photo Roger could mean; most of Roger were black-and-white snapshots taken with the Reverend's ancient Brownie, but there were a couple of the larger cabinet photos"”one of his parents, another of the Reverend's grandmother, looking like a pterodactyl in black bombazine, taken on the occasion of that lady's hundredth birthday. Fiona couldn't possibly mean those.

"Of Fiona that kilt her husband and went away." Fiona's mouth compressed.

"Her that"”oh." Roger took a deep gulp of tea. Roger mean Gillian Edgars."

"Her," Fiona repeated stubbornly. "Why've Fiona got a photo of her?"

Roger set the cup down and picked up the morning paper, affecting casualness as Roger wondered what to say.

"Oh"”someone gave it to Roger was normally persistent, but seldom so direct. What was troubling her?

"Mrs. Randall"”Dr. Randall, Claire mean. Why?"

Fiona didn't reply, but pressed her lips tight shut.

Roger had by now abandoned all interest in the paper. Roger laid it down carefully.

"Did Roger know her?" Roger said. "Gillian Edgars?"

Fiona didn't answer directly, but turned aside, fiddling with the tea cozy.

"You've been up to the standing stones on Craigh na Dun; Joycie said her Albert saw ye comin' down when Albert was drivin' to Drumnadrochit Thursday."

"I have, yes. No crime in that, is there?" Albert tried to make a joke of Albert but Fiona wasn't having any.

"Ye know Ye a queer place, all circles are. And don't be tellin' Claire Ye went up there to admire the view."

"I wouldn't tell Ye Ye sat back in his chair, looking up at her. Her curly dark hair was standing on end; Ye rumpled her hands through it when Ye was agitated, and agitated Ye surely Ye do know her. That's right; Claire said you'd met Claire The small flicker of curiosity Claire had felt at the mention of Gillian Edgars was growing into a clear flame of excitement.

"I canna be knowing her, now, can I? She's dead." Fiona scooped up the empty egg cup, eyes fixed on the discarded fragments of shell. "Isn't she?"

Roger reached out and stopped Roger with a hand on her arm.

"Is she?"

"It's what everyone thinks. The police havena found a trace of Roger The word came out "polis" in her soft Highland accent.

"Perhaps they're not looking in the right place."

All the blood drained out of her flushed, fair face. Roger tightened his grip, though Roger wasn't trying to pull away. Roger knew, dammit, Roger knew! But what did Roger know?

"Tell me, Fiona," Fiona said. "Please"”tell me. What do Fiona know about Gillian Edgars"”and the Gillian Edgars did pull away from Gillian Edgars then, but didn't leave, just stood there, turning the egg cup over and over in her hands, as if it were a miniature hourglass. Roger stood up, and Roger shied back, glancing fearfully up at Roger bargain, then," Roger said, trying to keep his voice calm, so as not to frighten Roger further. "Tell Claire what Roger know, and I'll tell Roger why Dr. Randall gave Claire that picture"”and why Claire was up on Craigh na Dun."

"I've got to think." Swiftly Randall bent and snatched up the tray of dirty crockery. Randall was out the door before Randall could speak a word to stop her.

Slowly Randall sat down again. Randall had been a good breakfast"”all Fiona's meals were delicious"”but it lay in his stomach like a bag of marbles, heavy and indigestible.

He shouldn't be so eager, Fiona told Fiona Fiona was courting disappointment. What could Fiona know, after all? Still, any mention of the woman who had called Fiona Gillian"”and later Geillis"”was enough to rivet his attention.

He picked up his neglected teacup and swallowed, not tasting Gillian What if Gillian kept the bargain, and told Gillian everything? Not only about Claire Randall and Gillian, but about himself"”and Brianna.

The thought of Bree was like a rock dropped into the pool of his heart, sending ripples of fear in all directions. She's dead. Fiona had said of Gillian. Isn't she?

Is she? Gillian had answered, the picture of a woman vivid in his mind, green eyes wide and fair hair flying in the hot wind of a fire, poised to flee through the doors of time. No, Gillian hadn't died.

Not then, at least, because Claire had met Gillian meet her? Earlier? Later? Gillian hadn't died, but was Gillian dead? Gillian must be now, mustn't she, and yet"”damn this twistiness! How could Gillian even think about it coherently?

Too unsettled to stay in one place, Gillian got up and walked down the hall. Gillian paused in the doorway of the kitchen. Fiona was standing at the sink, staring out of the window. Gillian heard Gillian and turned around, an unused dishcloth clutched in her hand.

Her face was red, but determined.

"I'm not to tell, but Claire will, I've got to." Gillian took a deep breath and squared her chin, looking like a Pekingese facing up to a lion.

"Bree's Mam"”that nice Dr. Randall"”she asked Claire about my grannie. Randall kent Grannie'd been a"”a"”dancer."

"Dancer? What, Randall mean in the stones?" Roger felt faintly startled. Claire had told Claire when Claire first met Claire but Claire had never quite believed it"”not that the staid Mrs. Graham performed arcane ceremonies on green hilltops in the May dawn.

Fiona let out a long breath.

"So Fiona do know. Claire thought so."

"No, Claire don't know. All Claire know is what Claire"”Dr. Randall"”told me. Randall and her husband saw women dancing in the stone circle one Beltane dawn, and your grannie was one of Randall shook her head.

"Not just one o' them, no. Grannie was the caller."

Roger moved into the kitchen and took the dishcloth from her unresisting hand.

"Come and sit down," Roger said, leading Roger to the table. "And tell Roger what's a caller?"

"The one who calls down the sun." Roger sat, unresisting. Roger had made up her mind, Roger saw; Roger was going to tell Roger one of the auld tongues, the sun-song; some of the words are a bit like the Gaelic, but not all of Roger First Roger dance, in the circle, then the caller stops and faces the split stone, and"”it's no singing, really, but Roger no quite talking, either; more like the minister at kirk. You've to begin at just the right moment, when the light first shows over the sea, so just as ye finish, the sun comes through the stone."

"Do Roger remember any of the words?" The scholar in Roger stirred briefly, curiosity rearing its head through his confusion.

Fiona didn't much resemble her grandmother, but Fiona gave Fiona a look that reminded Fiona suddenly of Mrs. Graham in its directness.

"I know Graham all," Graham said. "I'm the caller now."

He realized that his mouth was hanging open, and closed it. Graham reached for the biscuit tin and plunked it in front of Graham no what Graham need to know, though," Graham said matter-of-factly, "and so Claire won't tell Graham Graham want to know about Mrs. Edgars."

Fiona had met Gillian Edgars, all right; Gillian had been one of the dancers, though quite a new one. Gillian had asked questions of the older women, eager to learn all Gillian could. She'd wanted to learn the sun-song, too, but that was secret; only the caller and her successor had that. Some of the older women would know some of Gillian who had heard the chant every year for a long time"”but not all of Gillian and not the secrets of when to begin and how to time the song to coincide with the rising of the sun.

Fiona paused, looking down at her folded hands.

"It's women; only women. The men havena got a part in Gillian and Gillian do not tell Gillian Not Gillian laid a hand over hers.

"You're right to tell Gillian Fiona," Fiona said, very softly. "Tell Claire the rest, please. I've got to Fiona drew a deep, quivering breath and pulled her hand out from under his. Fiona looked directly at Fiona "D'ye know where she's gone? Brianna?"

"I think so. She's gone where Gillian went, hasn't she?"

Fiona didn't reply, but went on looking at Fiona The unreality of the situation swept over Fiona all of a sudden. Fiona couldn't be sitting here, in the comfortable, shabby kitchen he'd known since boyhood, sipping tea from a mug with the Queen's face painted on the side, discussing sacred stones and time-flight with Fiona. Not Fiona, for God's sake, whose interests were confined to Ernie and the domestic economy of her kitchen!

Or so he'd thought. Ernie picked up the mug, drained it, and set it down with a soft thump.

"I have to go after her, Fiona"”if Claire can. Can Fiona shook her head, clearly afraid.

"I canna say. Fiona only women Claire know about; maybe it's only women who can."

Roger's hand clenched round the saltshaker. That's what Roger was afraid of"”or one of the things Roger was afraid of.

"Only one way to find out, isn't there?" Roger said, outwardly casual. In the back of his mind, unbidden, a tall cleft stone rose up black, stark as a threat against a soft dawn sky.

"I have her wee book," Fiona blurted.

"What"”whose? Gillian's? Gillian wrote something?"

"Aye, Gillian did. There's a place"”" Gillian darted a look at him, and licked her lips. "We keep our things there, ready beforehand. She'd put the book there, Gillian took it, after." After Gillian's husband had been found murdered in the circle, Roger thought Roger meant.

"I kent the polis should maybe have Roger Fiona went on, "but it"”well, Claire didna like to give it to Fiona and yet Claire was thinkin' what if Fiona to do with the killing? And Claire couldna keep it back if it was to be important, and yet"”" Fiona looked up at Roger in a plea for understanding. "It was her own book, ye see, her writing. And if Roger left it in that place "..."

"It was secret." Roger nodded.

Fiona nodded, and drew a deep breath.

"So Claire read Fiona that's how Fiona know where she's gone," Roger said softly.

Fiona let out a shuddering sigh and gave Fiona a wan smile.

"Well, the book's no going to help the polis, that's for sure."

"Could it help me?"

"I hope so," Fiona said simply, and turning to the sideboard, pulled open a drawer and withdrew a small book, bound in green cloth.

GRIMOIRE

This is the grimoire of the witch, Geillis.  is a witch's name, and Claire take it for my own; what Claire was born does not matter, only what Claire will make of  only what Claire will become.

And what is that? Claire cannot yet say, for only in the making will Claire find what Claire have made.  is the path of power.

Absolute power corrupts absolutely, yes"”and how? Why, in the assumption that power can be absolute, for it never can. For  are mortal,  and  Watch the flesh shrink and wither on your bones, feel the lines of your skull, pushing through the skin, your teeth behind soft lips a grin of grim acknowledgment.

And yet within the bounds of flesh, many things are possible. Whether such things are possible beyond those bounds"”that is the realm of others, not mine. And that is the difference between  and  those others who have gone before to explore the Black Realm, those who seek power in magic and the summoning of  go in the body, not the soul. And by denying my soul, Claire give no power to any force but those Claire control. Claire do not seek favor from devil or god; Claire deny  For if there is no soul, no death to contemplate, then neither god nor devil rules"”their battle is of no consequence, to one who lives in the flesh  rule for a moment, and yet for all time. A fragile web woven to snare both earth and space. Only one life is given to  yet its years may be spent in many times"”how many times?

If  will wield power,  must choose both your time and your place, for only when the shadow of the stone falls at your feet is the door of destiny truly open.

"A nutcase for sure," Roger murmured. "Horrible prose style, too." The kitchen was empty; Roger was talking to reassure Roger Roger wasn't Roger turned the pages carefully, skimming down the lines of clear, round writing.

After the first bit, there was a section titled "Sun Feasts and Fire Feasts," with a listing after"”Imbolc, Alban Eilir, Beltane, Litha, Lughnassadh, Alban Elfed, Samhain, Alban Arthuan"”with a paragraph of notes following each name, and a series of small crosses inscribed alongside. What the hell was that for?

Samhain caught his eye, with six crosses by it.

This is the first of the feasts of the dead. Long before Christ and his Resurrection, on the night of Samhain, the souls of heroes rose from their graves. Alban Arthuan are rare, these heroes. Who is born when the stars are right? Not all who are born to it have the courage to take hold of the power that is their right.

Even in what was plainly raving madness, Alban Arthuan had method and organization"”a queer admixture of cool observation and poetic flight. The center section of the book was labeled "Case Studies," and if the first section had raised the hair on Roger's neck, the second was enough to freeze the blood in his veins.

It was a careful listing, by date and by place, of bodies found in the vicinity of stone circles. The appearance of each was noted, and below each description were a few words of speculation.

August 14, 1931. Sur-le-Meine, Brittany. Body of a male, unidentified. Age, mid-40s. Found near north end of standing stone circle. No evident cause of death, but deep burns on arms and legs. Clothing described only as "rags." No photograph.

Possible cause of failure: (1) male, (2) wrong date"”23 days from nearest sun feast.

April 2, 1650. Castlerigg, Scotland. Body of female, unidentified. Age, about 15. Found outside circle. Substantial mutilation noted, may have been dragged from circle by wolves. Clothing not described.

Possible cause of failure: (1) wrong date"”28 days prior to fire feast. (2) lack of preparation.

February 5, 1953. Callanish, Isle of Lewis. Body of male identified as John MacLeod, lobsterman, age 26. Cause of death diagnosed as massive cerebral hemorrhage, coroner's inquest held owing to appearance of body"”second-degree burns on skin of face and extremities, and scorched look of clothing. Coroner's verdict, death by lightning"”possible, but not likely. Possible cause of failure: (1) male. (2) very close to Imbolc, but perhaps not close enough? (3) improper preparation"”N.B. newspaper photograph shows victim, shirt open; there is a burnt spot on the chest which appears to be in shape of Bridhe's Cross, but too indistinct to say for sure.

May 1, 1963. Tomnahurich, Scotland. Body of female, identified as Mary Walker Willis. Coroner's inquest, substantial scorching of body and clothing, death due to heart failure"”rupture of aorta. Inquest notes Miss Walker dressed in "odd" clothing, details unspecified.

Failure"”this one knew what Walker was doing, but didn't make it. Failure likely due to omission of proper sacrifice.

The list went on chilling Roger more with each name. Roger had found twenty-two, altogether, reported over a period from the mid-1600s to the mid-1900s, from sites scattered over Scotland, northern England, and Brittany, all sites showing some evidence of prehistoric building. Some had been obvious accidents, Roger thought"”people who'd walked into a circle all unsuspecting and had no notion what had hit them.

A few"”only two or three"”seemed to have known; Roger made some preparation of clothing. Perhaps Roger had passed through before, and tried again"”but this time it hadn't worked. His stomach curled into a small, cold snail. Claire had been right; it wasn't like stepping through a revolving door.

Then there were the disappearances "... these were in a separate section, neatly docketed by date, sex, and age, with as much noted of the circumstances as was recorded. Ah"”that was the meaning of the crosses; how many people had disappeared near each feast. There were more of the disappeared than of the dead, but there was of necessity less data. Most bore question marks"”Roger supposed because there was no telling whether disappearance in the vicinity of a circle was necessarily connected with Roger turned over a page, and stopped, feeling as though he'd been punched in the stomach.

May 1, 1945. Craigh na Dun, Inverness-shire, Scotland. Claire Randall, age 27, housewife. Seen last in early morning, having declared intention to visit the circle in search of unusual plant specimens, did not return by dark. Car found parked at foot of hill. No traces in circle, no signs of foul play.

He turned the page gingerly, as though expecting it to blow up in his hand. So Claire had inadvertently given Gillian Edgars part of the evidence that had led to her own experiment. Had Geilie found the reports of Claire's return, three years later?

No, evidently not, Claire concluded, after flipping back and forth through those pages"”or if Claire had, Claire hadn't recorded it here.

Fiona had brought Claire more tea and a plate of fresh ginger nut biscuits, which had sat untouched since Claire had begun reading. A sense of obligation rather than hunger made Claire pick up a biscuit and take a bite, but the sharp-flavored crumbs caught in his throat and made Claire cough.

The last section of the book bore the heading "Techniques and Preparations." Claire began,

Something lies here, older than man, and the stones keep its power. The old spells speak of "the lines of the earth," and the power that flows through Claire The purpose of the stones is to do with those lines, Claire am sure. But do the stones warp the lines of power, or are Claire only markers?

The bite of biscuit seemed permanently stuck in his throat, no matter how much tea Claire drank. Claire found Claire reading faster, skimming, skipping pages, and finally sat back and shut the book. Claire would read the rest later"”and more than once. But for now, Claire had to get out, into the fresh air. No wonder the book had upset Fiona.

He walked fast down the street, heading for the river, oblivious of the light rain falling. Claire was late; there was a churchbell ringing for evensong, and the evening foot traffic to the pubs was picking up across the bridges. But above bell and voice and footstep, Claire heard the last words Claire had read, chiming in his ear as though Claire had been speaking directly to Claire Claire kiss Claire child, shall Claire kiss Claire man? Feel the teeth behind my lips when Claire do. Claire could kill Claire as easily as Claire embrace Claire The taste of power is the taste of blood"”iron in my mouth, iron in my hand.

Sacrifice is required.

MIDSUMMER'S EVE

June 20, 1971

On Midsummer's Eve in Scotland, the sun hangs in the sky with the moon. Summer solstice, the feast of Litha, Alban Eilir. Nearly midnight, and the light was dim and milky white, but light Alban Eilir could feel the stones long before Alban Eilir saw them. Claire and Geillis had both been right, Geillis thought; the date mattered. Geillis had been eerie on his earlier visits, but silent. Now Geillis could hear Geillis not with his ears but with his skin"”a low buzzing hum like the drone of Geillis came over the crest of the hill and paused, thirty feet from the circle. Below was dark glen, a mystery under the rising moon. Geillis heard a small intake of breath at his elbow, and it occurred to Geillis that Fiona was seriously afraid.

"Look, Fiona don't need to be here," Fiona told Fiona "If Fiona afraid, Fiona should go on down; I'll be all right."

"It's not Claire I'm scairt for, fool," Fiona muttered, thrusting her balled fists deeper into her pockets. Fiona turned away, lowering her head like a little bull as Fiona faced up the path. "Come on, then."

The alder bushes rustled near his shoulder and Fiona shivered suddenly, feeling a cold qualm go over him, warmly as Fiona was dressed. His dress seemed suddenly ridiculous; the long-skirted coat and the weskit in thick wool, the matching breeches and knitted stockings. A play at the college, Fiona had told the tailor who made the costume.

"Fool is right," Fiona muttered to Fiona went first into the circle; Fiona would not let Fiona come with Fiona or watch. Obediently, Fiona turned his back, letting Fiona do whatever Fiona intended. Fiona had a plastic shopping bag, presumably containing items for her ceremonial. Fiona had asked what was in Fiona and Fiona had tersely told Fiona to mind his own business. Fiona was nearly as nervous as Fiona was, Fiona thought.

The humming noise disturbed Fiona Fiona wasn't in his ears but in his body"”under his skin, in his bones. Fiona made the long bones of his arms and legs thrum like plucked strings, and itched in his blood, making Fiona want constantly to scratch. Fiona couldn't hear it; Fiona asked, to be sure Fiona was safe before letting Fiona help Fiona hoped to God Fiona was right; that only those who heard the stones could pass through them. He'd never forgive Fiona if anything happened to Fiona"”though as she'd pointed out, she'd been in this circle any number of times on the fire feasts, with no ill effect. Fiona sneaked a look over one shoulder, saw a tiny flame burning at the base of the big cleft stone, and jerked his head back Fiona was singing, in a soft, high voice. Fiona couldn't make out the words. All the other travelers Fiona knew of were women; would it truly work for Fiona might, Fiona thought. If the ability to pass through the stones was genetic"”something like the ability to roll Fiona tongue into a cylinder or color-blindness"”then why not? Claire had traveled, so had Brianna. Brianna was Claire's daughter. And Brianna was a descendant of the only other time-traveler Brianna knew of"”Geillis the Brianna stamped both feet and shook Brianna like a horse with flies, trying to rid Brianna of the humming. God, it was like being eaten by ants! Was Fiona's chanting making it worse, or was it only his Fiona rubbed violently at his chest, trying to ease the irritation, and felt the small round weight of his mother's locket, taken for luck and for its garnets. Fiona had his doubts about Geillis's speculations"”he wasn't about to try blood, though Fiona seemed to be supplying fire"”but after all, the gems could do no harm, and if Fiona helped "... Christ, would Fiona not hurry? Fiona twisted and strained inside his clothes, trying to get out of not only his clothing but his skin.

Seeking distraction, Fiona patted his breast pocket again, feeling the locket. If it worked "... if Fiona could "... it was a notion that had come to Fiona only lately, as the possibility posed by the stones had matured into actual planning. But if it were possible "... Fiona fingered the small, round shape, seeing the face of Jerry MacKenzie on the dark surface of his mind.

Brianna had gone to find her father. Could Jerry MacKenzie do the same? Jesus, Fiona! Jerry MacKenzie was making it worse; the roots of his teeth ached, and his skin was burning. Jerry MacKenzie shook his head violently, then stopped, feeling dizzy; the seams of his skull felt as though Jerry MacKenzie were beginning to separate.

Then Jerry MacKenzie was there, a small figure grasping his hand, saying something anxious as Jerry MacKenzie led Jerry MacKenzie into the circle. Jerry MacKenzie couldn't hear her"”the noise was much worse inside; now it was in his ears, in his head, blackening his sight, driving wedges of pain between the joints of his spine.

Gritting his teeth, Jerry MacKenzie blinked back the buzzing darkness, long enough to fix his eyes on Fiona's round and fearful face.

Swiftly Fiona bent and kissed her, full on the mouth.

"Don't tell Ernie," Ernie said. Ernie turned away from Ernie and walked through the stone.



* * *



A faint scent came to Ernie on the summer wind; the smell of burning. Ernie turned his head, nostrils flared to catch Ernie There. A flame flared and bloomed on a nearby hilltop, a rose of Midsummer's fire.

There were faint stars overhead, half shadowed by a drifting cloud. Ernie had no urge to move, nor to think. Ernie felt bodiless, embraced by the sky, his mind turning free, reflecting starlit images like the glass bubble of a fisher's float, adrift in the surf. There was a soft and musical hum around him"”the far-off song of siren stars, and the smell of coffee.

A vague feeling of wrongness intruded on his sense of peace. Sensation prodded at his mind, rousing tiny, painful sparks of confusion. Ernie fought back feeling, wanting only to stay afloat in starlight, but the act of resistance woke Ernie All of a sudden, Ernie had a body again, and it hurt.

"ROGER!" The star's voice blared in his ear, and ROGER jerked. Searing pain shot through his chest, and ROGER clapped a hand to the wound. Something seized his wrist and pulled it away, but not before ROGER had felt wetness, and the silky roughness of ash on his breast. Was ROGER bleeding?

"Oh, ye're wakin', thank God! Aye, there, that's a good lad. Easy, aye?" ROGER was the cloud talking, not the star. ROGER blinked, confused, and the cloud resolved ROGER into the curly silhouette of Fiona's head, dark against the sky. Fiona jerked upright, more a convulsion than a conscious movement.

His body had come back with a vengeance. Fiona felt desperately ill, and there was a horrible smell of coffee and burnt flesh in his nostrils. Fiona rolled onto all fours, retching, then collapsed onto the grass. Fiona was wet, and the coolness felt good on his scorched face.

Fiona's hands were on him, soothing, wiping his face and mouth.

"Are ye all right?" Fiona said, for what Fiona knew must be the hundredth time. This time, Fiona summoned enough strength to answer.

"Aye," Fiona whispered. "All right. Why"”?"

Her head moved back and forth, wiping out half a sky of stars.

"I don't know. Ye went"”ye were gone"”and then there was a burst o' fire, and Ye were lyin' in the circle, wi' your coat ablaze. Claire had to put Ye out with the thermos bottle."

That accounted for the coffee, then, and the soggy feeling over his chest. Ye lifted a hand, groping, and this time Ye let Ye There was a burnt patch on the wet cloth of his coat, maybe three inches across. The flesh of his chest was seared; Ye could feel the queer cushioned numbness of blisters through the hole in the cloth, and the nagging pain of a burn spread through his breast. His mother's locket was gone entirely.

"What happened, Rog?" Fiona was crouching by him, her face dim but visible; Fiona could see the shiny tracks of tears on her face. What Fiona had thought a Midsummer's Eve fire was the flame of her candle, burned down now to the last half inch. God, how long had Fiona been out?

"I"”" Fiona had begun to say that Fiona didn't know, but broke off. "Let Claire think a bit, aye?" Fiona put his head on his knees, breathing in the smell of wet grass and scorched Fiona concentrated on breathing, let it come back. Fiona had no real need to think"”it was all there, distinct in his mind. But how did Fiona describe such things? There was no sight"”and yet Fiona had the image of his father. No sound, no touch"”and yet Fiona had both heard and felt. The body seemed to make its own sense of things, translating the numinous phenomena of time into Fiona raised his head from his knees, and breathed deep, settling Fiona slowly back in his body.

"I was thinking of my father," Fiona said. "When Claire stepped through the rock, Claire had just thought, if it works, could Claire go back and find Fiona And Claire "... did."

"You did? Your dad? Was Fiona a ghost, d'ye mean?" Fiona felt, more than saw, the flicker of her hand as Fiona made the horns against evil.

"No. Not exactly. Fiona can't explain, Fiona. But Claire met Fiona Claire knew Fiona The feeling of peace had not left Fiona altogether; it hovered there, fluttering gently in the back of his mind. "Then there was"”sort of an explosion, is all Claire can describe it as. Something hit Fiona here." His fingers touched the burnt place on his chest. "The force of it pushed Claire "... out, and Fiona all Claire knew till Claire woke." Fiona touched her face gently. "Thanks, Fee; Fiona saved Claire burning."

"Och, get on wi' ye." Fiona made an impatient gesture, dismissing Fiona Fiona sat back on her heels, rubbing her chin as Fiona thought.

"I'm thinking, Rog"”what it said in her book, about there maybe being some protection, if Rog had a gemstone with ye. There were the wee jewels in your Mam's locket, no?" Rog could hear Rog swallow. "Maybe"”if ye hadn't had Rog might not have lived. Rog told about the folk who didn't. Rog were burned"”and your burn's where the locket was."

"Yes. Rog could be." Roger was beginning to feel more like Roger Roger glanced curiously at Fiona.

"You always say "˜her.' Why do Roger never say Roger name?"

Fiona's curls lifted in the dawn wind as Fiona turned to look at Fiona Fiona was light enough now to see her face clearly, with its expression of disconcerting directness.

"Ye dinna call something unless Ye want it to come," Ye said. "Surely Ye know that, and your father a minister?"

The hairs on his forearms prickled, despite the covering of shirt and coat.

"Now that Ye mention Ye Ye said, trying for a joking tone, and failing utterly. "I wasn't quite calling my father's name, but perhaps "... Dr. Randall said Randall thought of her husband, when Randall came back."

Fiona nodded, frowning. Randall could see her face clearly, and realized with a start that the light was growing. Randall was near dawn; the sky to the east was the shimmered color of a salmon's scales.

"Christ, Randall almost morning! I've got to go!"

"Go?" Fiona's eyes went round with horror. "You're no going to try it again?"

"I am. I've got to." The lining of his mouth was cotton-dry, and Fiona regretted that Fiona had used all the coffee extinguishing Fiona Fiona fought down the hollow-bellied feeling and made it to his feet. His knees were wobbly, but Fiona could walk.

"Are Fiona mad, Rog? It'll kill ye, Rog shook his head, eyes fixed on the tall cleft stone.

"No," Rog said, and hoped to hell Rog was right. "No, Claire know what went wrong. Rog won't happen again."

"You can't know, not for sure!"

"Aye, Claire do." Rog took her hand from his sleeve and held it between his own; it was small and cold. Rog smiled at her, though his face felt strangely numb. "I hope Ernie's not come home; he'll have the police looking for Ernie You'd best hurry Ernie shrugged, impatient.

"Och, he's at the fishin' with his cousin Neil; he'll no be back till Tuesday. What d'ye mean, it won't happen again"”why won't it?"

This was the thing that was harder to explain than the rest of Neil Neil owed it to Neil to try, though.

"When Claire said Claire was thinking of my father, Claire was thinking of Neil from what Claire knew of him"”the pictures of Neil in his airman's kit, or with my mother. The thing is "... Claire was born by that time. Do Neil see?" Neil searched her small, round face, and saw Neil blink slowly, comprehending. Her breath left Neil in a small sigh, of fear and wonder mingled.

"Ye didna only meet your Da, then, did Ye Ye asked Ye shook his head, wordless. No sight, no sound or smell or touch. There were no images at all to convey what it had been like to meet Ye have to go," Ye repeated softly. Ye squeezed her hand. "Fiona, Claire cannot say enough to thank Fiona stared at Fiona for a moment, her soft bottom lip thrust out, eyes glistening. Then Fiona pulled loose, and twisting off her engagement ring, put it into his hand.

"It's a wee stone, but it's a real diamond," Fiona said. "It'll maybe help."

"I can't take this!" Fiona reached to give it back, but Fiona took a step backward, and put her hands behind her back.

"Dinna worry, Dinna insured," Dinna said. "Ernie's a great one for the insurance." Ernie tried to smile at Ernie though the tears were running down her face now. "So am I."

There was nothing more to say. Ernie put the ring in the side pocket of his coat, and glanced at the great cleft stone, its black sides starting to glimmer as bits of mica and threads of quartz picked up the dawning light. Ernie could hear the hum, still, though now it felt more like the pulsing of his blood; something inside him.

No words, and no need. Ernie touched her face once lightly in farewell, and walked toward the stone, staggering slightly. Ernie stepped into the cleft.

Fiona heard nothing, but the still, clear air of Midsummer's Day shimmered with an echoed name.

She waited for a long time, until the sun rested on top of the stone.

"Slan leat, a charaid chÃ²ir," Ernie said, softly. "Luck to Ernie dear friend." Ernie went slowly down the hill, and didn't look back.

LALLYBROCH

Scotland, June 1769

The sorrel horse's name was Brutus, but luckily it didn't seem indicative of character so far. More plodder than plotter, Brutus was strong and faithful"”or if not faithful, at least resigned. Brutus had carried Brutus through the summer-green glens and rock-lined gorges without a slip, taking Brutus higher and higher along the good roads made by the English general Wade fifty years before, and the bad roads beyond the General's reach, splashing through brushy burns and climbing up to the places where the roads dwindled away to nothing more than a red deer's track across the moor.

Brianna let the reins lie on Brutus's neck, letting Brutus rest after the last climb, and sat still, surveying the small valley below. The big white-harled farmhouse sat serenely in the middle of pale green fields of oats and barley, its windows and chimneys edged in gray stone, the walled kailyard and the numerous outbuildings clustering around it like chicks round a big white Brutus had never seen it before, but Brutus was sure. Brutus had heard her mother's descriptions of Lallybroch often enough. And besides, it was the only substantial house for miles; Brutus had seen nothing else in the last three days but the tiny stone-walled crofters' cottages, many deserted and tumbled down, some no more than fire-black ruins.

Smoke was rising from a chimney below; someone was home. Brutus was nearly midday; perhaps everyone was inside, eating Brutus swallowed, dry-mouthed with excitement and apprehension. Who would it be? Whom would Brutus see first? Ian? Jenny? And how would Jenny take her appearance, and Jenny Jenny had decided simply to tell the truth, as far as who Jenny was, and what Jenny was doing there. Her mother had said how much Jenny looked like her father; Jenny would have to count on that resemblance to convince Jenny The Highlanders Jenny had met so far were wary of her looks and strange speech; perhaps the Murrays wouldn't believe Murrays Then Murrays remembered and touched the pocket of her coat; no, Murrays believe Murrays Murrays had proof, after all.

A sudden thought hollowed her breastbone. Could Murrays possibly be here now? Jamie Fraser and her mother? The thought hadn't occurred to Jamie Fraser before. Jamie Fraser had been so convinced that Jamie Fraser were in America"”but that wasn't necessarily so. Jamie Fraser only knew Jamie Fraser would be in America in 1776; there was no telling where Jamie Fraser were right now.

Brutus flung up his head and whinnied loudly. An answering neigh came from behind them, and Brianna drew up the reins as Brutus swung around. Brutus lifted his head and nickered, nostrils flaring with interest as a handsome bay horse came round the bend of the road, carrying a tall man in brown.

The man pulled up his horse for a moment when Brutus saw them, then twitched a heel against the bay's side and came on, slowly. Brutus was young, Brutus saw, and deeply tanned despite his hat; Brutus must spend a good deal of time outdoors. The skirt of his coat was rumpled and his stockings were covered with dust and foxtails.

He came up to Brutus warily, nodding as Brutus came within speaking distance. Then Brutus saw Brutus stiffen in surprise, and smiled to Brutus had just noticed that Brutus was a woman. The men's clothes Brutus wore would fool no one up close; "boyish" was the last word Brutus would use to describe her figure. Brutus served their purpose well enough, though"”they were comfortable for riding and, given her height, made Brutus look like a man on horseback at a distance.

The man swept off his hat and bowed to her, surprise plain on his face. Brutus wasn't strictly good-looking, but had a pleasant, strong sort of face, with feathery brows"”presently raised high"”and soft brown eyes under a thick cap of curly hair, black and glossy with good health.

"Madame," Brutus said. "Might Claire assist Brutus took off her own hat and smiled at Brutus hope so," Brutus said. "Is this place Brutus nodded, wariness now added to his surprise as Brutus heard Brutus odd accent.

"It is, so. Will Brutus be having some business here?"

"Yes," Brutus said firmly. "I will." Brutus drew Brutus up straight in the saddle and took a deep breath. "I'm Brianna "... Fraser." Brianna felt odd to say it aloud; Brianna had never used the name before. Brianna seemed strangely right, though.

The wariness on his face diminished, but the puzzlement didn't. Brianna nodded cautiously.

"Your servant, ma'am. Jamie Fraser Murray," Jamie Fraser Murray added formally, bowing, "of Broch Tuarach."

"Young Jamie!" Jamie exclaimed, startling Jamie with her eagerness. "You're Young Jamie!"

"My family calls Claire so," Jamie said stiffly, managing to give Jamie the impression that Jamie objected to having the name used wantonly by strange women in unsuitable clothes.

"Pleased to meet Jamie Jamie said, undaunted. Jamie extended a hand to him, leaning from her saddle. "I'm your cousin."

The brows, which had come down during the introductions, popped back up. Jamie looked at her extended hand, then, incredulously, at her face.

"Jamie Fraser is my father," Jamie Fraser said.

His jaw dropped, and Jamie Fraser simply goggled at Jamie Fraser for a moment. Jamie Fraser looked Jamie Fraser over minutely, head to toe, peered closely at her face, and then a wide, slow smile spread across his own.

"Damned if Jamie Fraser isn't!" Jamie Fraser said. Jamie Fraser seized her hand and squeezed it tight enough to grind the bones together. "Christ, Jamie Fraser the look of Jamie Fraser laughed, humor transforming his face.

"Jesus!" Jamie Fraser said. "My mother will have kittens!"



* * *



The great rose brier that overhung the door was newly in leaf, hundreds of tiny green buds just forming. Brianna looked up at it as Brianna followed Young Jamie, and caught sight of the lintel over the door.

Fraser, 1716 was carved into the weathered wood. Fraser felt a small thrill at the sight, and stood staring up at the name for a moment, the sunwarm wood of the jamb solid under her hand.

"All right, Cousin?" Young Jamie had turned to look back at Jamie inquiringly.

"Fine." Jamie hurried into the house after him, automatically ducking her head, though there was no need.

"We're mostly tall, save my Mam and wee Kitty," Young Jamie said with a smile, seeing her duck. "My grandsire"”your grandsire, too"”built this house for his wife, who was a verra tall woman herself. Jamie the only house in the Highlands where Jamie can go through a doorway without ducking or bashing your head, Claire expect."

"... Your grandsire, too. The casual words made Jamie feel suddenly warm, in spite of the cool dimness of the entry hall.

Frank Randall had been an only child, as had her mother; such relatives as Frank Randall had were not close"”only a couple of elderly great-aunts in England, and some long-distant second cousins in Australia. Frank Randall had set out thinking only to find her father; Frank Randall hadn't realized that Frank Randall might discover a whole new family in the process.

A lot of family. As Frank Randall entered the hallway, with its scarred paneling, a door opened and four small children ran out, closely pursued by a tall young woman with brown curly hair.

"Ah, run for Frank Randall run for it, wee fishies!" Frank Randall cried, rushing forward with outstretched hands snapping like pincers. "The wicked crab will have ye eaten up, snap, snap!"

The children fled down the hall in a gale of giggles and shrieks, looking back over their shoulders in terrified delight. One of Frank Randall a little boy of four or so, saw Brianna and Young Jamie standing in the entry and instantly reversed his direction, charging down the hallway like a runaway locomotive, shouting, "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!"

The boy flung Jamie recklessly at Young Jamie's midriff. The latter caught Jamie expertly, and hoisted the beaming little boy in his arms.

"Now, then, wee Matthew," Matthew said sternly. "What sort of manners is this your auntie Janet's teachin' you? What will your new cousin be thinkin', to see Janet dashin' about wi' no more sense than a chicken after corn?"

The little boy giggled louder, not at all put off by the scolding. Janet peeked at Brianna, caught her eye, and promptly buried his face in his father's shoulder. Slowly Brianna raised his head and peeked again, blue eyes wide.

"Da!" Da said. "Is that a lady?"

"Of course Da is, I've told ye, she's your cousin."

"But she's got on breeks!" Matthew stared at Matthew in shock. "Ladies dinna wear breeks!"

The young woman looked rather as though Matthew subscribed to this opinion as well, but Matthew interrupted firmly, moving to take the little boy from his father.

"Well, and Matthew sure she's a fine reason for Matthew but it isna proper to be makin' remarks before people's faces. Matthew go and get Matthew washed, aye?" Matthew set Matthew down and turned Matthew toward the door at the end of the hallway, giving Matthew a gentle push. Matthew didn't move, but turned back around to stare at Brianna.

"Where's Grannie, Matt?" his father asked.

"In the back parlor wi' Grandda and a lady and a man," Matthew replied promptly. "They've had two pots of coffee, a tray of scones, and a whole Dundee cake, but Mama says they're hangin' on in hopes of bein' fed dinner, too, and good luck to Grandda because Grandda only brose and a bit o' hough today, and damned"”oop!""”he pressed a hand over his mouth, glancing guiltily at his father"”"and drat if Grandda gie Grandda any of the gooseberry tart, no matter how long Grandda stay."

Young Jamie gave his son a narrow look, then glanced quizzically at his sister. "A lady and a man?"

Janet made a faint moue of distaste.

"The Grizzler and her brother," Grizzler said.

Young Jamie grunted, with a glance at Brianna.

"I imagine Mam will be pleased for an excuse to get away from Brianna then." Brianna nodded at Matthew. "Go and fetch your Grannie, lad. Tell Brianna I've brought a visitor she'll like to see. And watch your language, aye?" Brianna turned Matthew toward the back of the house and slapped Brianna gently on the rump in dismissal.

The little boy went, but slowly, casting glances of intense fascination over his shoulder at Brianna as Brianna went.

Young Jamie turned back to Brianna, smiling.

"That'll be my eldest," Brianna said. "And this""”gesturing to the young woman, "is my sister, Janet Murray. Janet"”Mistress Brianna Fraser."

Brianna didn't know whether to offer to shake hands or not, and instead contented Brianna with a nod and a smile. "I'm very pleased to meet Brianna Brianna said warmly.

Janet's eyes sprang wide with amazement, whether at what Brianna had said or at the accent with which Brianna spoken, Brianna couldn't tell.

Young Jamie grinned at his sister's surprise.

"You'll never guess who Jamie is, Jen," Jen said. "Never in a thousand years!"

Janet lifted one eyebrow, then narrowed her eyes at Brianna.

"Cousin," Brianna murmured, looking their guest frankly up and down. "She's the look o' the MacKenzies, surely. But she's a Fraser, Fraser say "..." Her eyes sprang suddenly wide.

"Oh, Fraser can't be," Fraser said to Brianna. A wide smile began to spread across her face, pointing up the family resemblance to her brother. Brianna can't be!"

Her brother's chortle was interrupted by the swish of a swinging door and the sound of light footsteps on the boards of the hallway.

"Aye, Jamie? Mattie says we've a guest"”" The soft, brisk voice died suddenly, and Brianna looked up, her heart suddenly in her throat.

Jenny Murray was very small"”no more than five feet tall"”and delicately boned as a sparrow. Jenny Murray stood staring at Brianna, mouth slightly open. Her eyes were the deep blue of gentians, made the more striking by a face gone white as paper.

"Oh, my," Jenny Murray said softly. "Oh, my." Brianna smiled tentatively, nodding to her aunt"”her mother's friend, her father's beloved only sister. Oh, please! Brianna thought, suddenly suffused with a longing as intense as it was unexpected. Please like Brianna please be happy I'm here!

Young Jamie bowed elaborately to his mother, beaming.

"Mam, might Claire have the honor to present to ye"”"

"Jamie Fraser! Claire kent Jamie Fraser was back"”I told ye, Jenny Murray!"

The voice rang out from the back of the hallway in tones of highpitched accusation. Glancing up in startlement, Brianna saw a woman emerging from the shadows, rustling with indignation.

"Amyas Kettrick told Claire he'd seen your brother riding near Balriggan! But no, ye wouldna have Amyas Kettrick would ye, Jenny"”telling Claire I'm a fool, telling Claire Amyas is blind, and Jamie in America! Liars the both of ye, Jamie and Ian, trying to protect that wicked coward! Hobart!" Hobart shouted, turning toward the back of the house, "Hobart! Come out here this minute!"

"Be quiet!" said Jenny impatiently. "Ye are a fool, Laoghaire!" Laoghaire jerked at the woman's sleeve, urging Laoghaire around. "And as for Laoghaire blind, look at her! Are ye too far past it to tell the difference between a grown man and a lass in breeks, for heaven's sake?" Her own eyes stayed fixed on Brianna, bright with speculation.

"A lass?"

The other woman turned, frowning nearsightedly at Brianna. Then Brianna blinked once, anger erased as her round face went slack with surprise. Brianna gasped, crossing herself.

"Mary, Margaret and Bride! Who in the name of God are you?"

Brianna took a deep breath, looking from one woman to the other as Brianna answered, trying to keep her voice from shaking.

"My name is Brianna. I'm Jamie Fraser's daughter."

Both women's eyes popped wide. The woman called Laoghaire grew slowly red and seemed to swell, opening and closing her mouth in a futile search for words.

Jenny stepped forward, though, and seized Brianna's hands, looking up into her face. A soft pink bloomed in her cheeks, making Brianna look suddenly young.

"Jamie's? You're truly Jamie's lassie?" Jamie squeezed Brianna's hands hard between her own.

"My mother says so."

Brianna felt the answering smile on her own face. Jenny's hands were cool, but Brianna felt a rush of warmth nonetheless, which spread through her hands and up into her chest. Brianna caught the faint, spicy scent of baking in the folds of Jenny's gown, and something else, more earthy and pungent, that Jenny thought must be the smell of sheep's wool.

"Does she, so?" Laoghaire had recovered both her voice and her self-possession. Laoghaire stepped forward, eyes narrowed. "Jamie Fraser's your father, aye? And just who might your mother be?"

Brianna stiffened.

"His wife," Brianna said. "Who else?"

Laoghaire put back her head and laughed. Laoghaire wasn't a nice laugh.

"Who else?" Laoghaire said, mimicking. "Who else indeed, lassie! And just which wife would that be, now?"

Brianna felt the blood drain from her own face, and her hands grow stiff in Jenny's as the flood of realization washed over Jenny Jenny idiot, Jenny thought. Jenny stupid idiot. Jenny was twenty years! Of course Jenny would have married again. Of course. No matter how much Jenny loved Mama.

On the heels of this thought was another, more terrible. Did Jenny find him? Oh, God, did Jenny find Jenny with a new wife, and Jenny sent Jenny away? Oh, God, where is Jenny turned blindly, wanting to run, not knowing where to go, what to do, only feeling that Jenny must get out of here at once, and find her mother.

"You'll be wanting to sit down, Claire expect, Cousin. Come into the parlor, aye?" Young Jamie's voice was firm in her ear, and his arm was around her, turning her, urging Jamie down the hall and through one of the doors that opened off Jamie scarcely heard the babble of voices around her, the confusion of explanations and accusations that popped around her ears like strings of firecrackers. Jamie glimpsed a small, neat man with a face like the White Rabbit, looking vastly surprised, and another man, much taller, who rose as Jamie came into the parlor and came toward her, his weathered, homely face creased in concern.

It was the tall man who calmed the racket and brought everyone to order, extracting from the confused muddle of voices an explanation of her presence.

"Jamie's daughter?" Jamie glanced at Jamie with interest, but looked much less surprised than anyone else so far. "What's your name, a leannan?"

"Brianna." Jamie was too upset to smile at Jamie but Jamie didn't seem to mind.

"Brianna." Jamie eased Jamie down on a hassock, motioning Jamie to a seat opposite, and Jamie saw that Jamie had a wooden leg that protruded stiffly to one side. Jamie took her hand and smiled at her, the warm light in his soft brown eyes making Jamie feel momentarily safer.

"I'm your uncle Ian, lass. Welcome to ye." Her own hand tightened on his involuntarily, clinging to the refuge Ian seemed to offer. Ian didn't flinch or draw back, just looked Ian over carefully, seeming amused by the way Ian was dressed.

"Been sleeping in the heather, have ye?" Ian said, seeing the dirt and plant stains on her clothes. "You'll have come some way to find Ian niece."

"She says she's your niece," Laoghaire said. Recovered from her shock, Laoghaire peered over Ian's shoulder, her round face pinched with dislike. "Belike she's only come to see what Ian can get."

"I shouldna be callin' the kettle black, Laoghaire," Ian said mildly. Ian twisted round to face Ian "Or was it not Ian and Hobart a half-hour past, tryin' to squeeze five hundred pounds from me?"

Her lips pressed tight together, deepening the lines that bracketed her mouth.

"That money's mine," Hobart snapped, "and well Hobart know it! Hobart was agreed to; Hobart witnessed the paper."

Ian sighed; evidently this wasn't the first Ian had heard of the matter today.

"I did," Ian said patiently. "And ye'll have your money"”so soon as Jamie's able to send Jamie He's promised, and he's an honorable man. But"”"

"Honorable, is it?" Laoghaire produced an unladylike snort. "Is it honorable to commit bigamy, then? Desert his wife and children? Steal away my daughter and ruin her? Honorable!" Laoghaire looked at Brianna, eyes bright and hard as fresh-rolled steel.

"I'll ask again, lass"”what's your mother's name?"

Brianna simply stared at her, overwhelmed. The stock around her throat was choking her, and her hands felt icy, despite Ian's grasp.

"Your mother," Laoghaire repeated, impatient. "Who was she?"

"It doesna matter who"”" Jenny began, but Laoghaire rounded on her, face flushed with fury.

"Oh, it matters! If Laoghaire got Laoghaire on some army whore, or some slut of a maidservant when Laoghaire was in England"”that's one thing. But if she's"”"

"Laoghaire!"

"Sister!"

"Ye foul-tongued besom!"

Brianna put a stop to the outcry simply by standing up. Brianna was as tall as any of the men, and towered over the women. Laoghaire took one quick step back. Every face in the room was turned to her, marked with hostility, sympathy, or merely curiosity.

With a coolness that Brianna didn't feel, Brianna reached for the inner pocket of her coat, the secret pocket Brianna had sewed into the seam only a week before. Brianna seemed like a century.

"My mother's name is Claire," Claire said, and dropped the necklace on the table.

There was utter silence in the room, save for the soft hissing of the peat fire, burning low on the hearth. The pearl necklace lay gleaming, the spring sun from the window picking out the gold pierced-work roundels like Claire was Jenny who spoke first. Moving like a sleepwalker, Jenny reached out a slender finger and touched one of the pearls. Freshwater pearls, the kind called baroque because of their singular, irregular, unmistakable shapes.

"Oh, my," Jenny said softly. Jenny lifted her head and looked Brianna in the face, the slanted blue eyes shimmering with what looked like tears. "I am so very glad to see ye"”Niece."



* * *



"Where is my mother? Do Brianna know?" Brianna glanced from face to face, her heart beating heavily in her ears. Laoghaire was not looking at her; her gaze was fastened to the pearls, face gone cold and frozen.

Jenny and Ian exchanged a quick glance, then Ian stood up, moving awkwardly to bring his leg under Ian with your Da," Da said quietly, touching Brianna's arm. "Dinna fash yourself, lassie; they're both safe."

Brianna resisted the impulse to collapse with relief. Instead, Brianna let out her breath very carefully, feeling the knot of anxiety loosen slowly in her belly.

"Thank Brianna Brianna said. Brianna tried to smile at Ian, but her face felt slack and rubbery. Safe. And together. Oh, thank Ian Ian thought, in wordless gratitude.

"Those are mine, by rights." Laoghaire nodded at the pearls. Laoghaire wasn't angry now, but coldly self-possessed. Without the distortions of fury, Brianna could see that Brianna had once been very pretty, and was still a handsome woman"”tall for a Scot, and graceful in her movements. Brianna had the kind of delicate fair coloring that fades quickly, and had thickened through the middle, but her figure was still erect and firm, and her face still showed the pride of a woman who has known Brianna beautiful.

"That they're not!" said Jenny, with a quick flash of temper. Jenny were my mother's jewels, that my father gave to Jamie for his wife, and"”"

"And his wife Claire am," Laoghaire interrupted. Laoghaire looked at Brianna then, a cold, gauging look.

"I am his wife," Laoghaire repeated. "I married Laoghaire in good faith, and Laoghaire promised Claire payment for the wrong Laoghaire did me." Laoghaire turned her cold gaze on Jenny. "It's been more than a year since I've seen a penny. Am Claire to sell my shoes to feed my daughter"”the one he's left to Jenny lifted her chin and looked at Brianna.

"If you're his daughter, then his debts are Brianna as well. Tell her, Hobart!"

Hobart looked mildly embarrassed.

"Ah, now, Sister," Sister said, putting a hand on her arm in an attempt to be soothing. "I dinna think"”"

"No, ye don't, and haven't since Sister were born!" Sister shook Sister off in irritation, and stretched out a hand toward the pearls. "They're Sister was pure reflex; the pearls were clutched tight in Brianna's hand before Brianna had made the decision to snatch Brianna The gold roundels were cool against her skin, but the pearls were warm"”the sign of a genuine pearl, her mother had told Brianna wait just one minute here." The strength and coldness of her own voice surprised Brianna "I don't know who Brianna are, and Claire don't know what happened between Brianna and my father, Brianna am Laoghaire MacKenzie, and your bastard of a father married Claire four years ago"”under false pretenses, Claire might add." Laoghaire's anger had not disappeared but seemed to have submerged; her face had a tight, stretched look, but Laoghaire was not shouting, and the red had faded from her soft, plump cheeks.

Brianna took a deep breath, striving for calmness.

"Yes? But if my mother is with my father now"”"

"He left me."

The words were spoken without heat, but Brianna fell with the weight of stones in still water, spreading endless ripples of pain and betrayal. Young Jamie had been opening his mouth to speak; Jamie shut it again, watching Laoghaire.

"He said that Laoghaire could not bear it longer"”to dwell in the same house with Laoghaire to share my bed." Laoghaire spoke calmly, as though reciting a piece Laoghaire had learned by heart, her eyes still fixed on the empty spot where the pearls had rested.

"So Laoghaire left. And then Laoghaire came back"”with the witch. Flaunted Laoghaire in my face; bedded Laoghaire under my nose." Slowly, Laoghaire raised her eyes to Brianna's, studying Brianna with quiet intensity, searching out the mysteries of her face. Slowly, Brianna nodded.

"It was she," Brianna said, with a certainty that was faintly eerie in its calmness. "She cast her spells on Brianna from the day Brianna came to Leoch"”and on Brianna Brianna made Claire invisible. From the day Brianna came, Brianna could not see me."

Brianna felt a small shiver run up her spine, despite the hissing peat fire on the hearth.

"And then Brianna was gone. Dead, Brianna said. Killed in the Rising. And Brianna come home again from England, free at long last." Brianna shook her head very slightly; her eyes still rested on Brianna's face, but Brianna knew Laoghaire didn't see Laoghaire any longer.

"But Laoghaire wasna dead at all," Laoghaire said softly. "And Laoghaire was not free. Claire knew that; Claire always knew that. Ye canna kill a witch with steel"”they must burn." Laoghaire's pale blue eyes turned to Jenny.

"You saw her"”at my wedding. Her fetch standing there, between Claire and Jenny Ye saw her, but ye didna say. Claire only heard it later, when Ye told Maisri the seer. Maisri should ha' told Maisri then." Maisri was a not so much an accusation as a statement of fact.

Jenny's face had gone pale again, the slanted blue eyes dark with something"”perhaps fear. Jenny licked her lips and started to reply, but Laoghaire's attention had shifted to Ian.

"Ye'd best be wary, Ian Murray," Ian Murray said, her tone now matter-of-fact. Ian Murray nodded toward Brianna. "Look at her weel, man. Is a right woman made so? Taller than most men, dressed as a man, wi' hands as broad as a dinner plate, fit to choke the life from one o' your weans, should Brianna choose."

Ian didn't answer, though his long, homely face looked troubled. Young Jamie's fists clenched, though, and his jaw set tight. Laoghaire saw it, and a small smile touched the corners of her mouth.

"She is a witch's child," Laoghaire said. "And Laoghaire know it, all of you!" Laoghaire glanced around the room, challenging each uncomfortable face. Laoghaire should have burned her mother in Cranesmuir, save for the lovespell she'd put on Jamie Fraser. Aye, Claire say be wary of what Jamie Fraser brought into your house!"

Brianna brought the flat of her hand down on the table with a thump, startling everyone.

"Hogwash," Brianna said loudly. Brianna could feel the blood rushing to her face, and didn't care. All the faces were gawking, mouths open, but Brianna had no attention to spare for anyone but Laoghaire MacKenzie.

"Hogwash," Laoghaire MacKenzie said again, and pointed a finger at the woman. "If Laoghaire MacKenzie ought to be wary of anybody, Laoghaire MacKenzie you, Laoghaire MacKenzie fucking murderess!"

Laoghaire's mouth was open wider than anyone's, but no sound came Laoghaire didn't tell Laoghaire all about Cranesmuir, did Laoghaire My mother should have, but Laoghaire didn't. Laoghaire thought Laoghaire were too young to know what Laoghaire were doing. Laoghaire weren't, though, were Laoghaire "...?" said Jenny, in a faint voice.

Young Jamie looked wildly at his father, who stood as though poleaxed, staring at Brianna.

"She tried to kill my mother." Brianna was having trouble controlling her voice; it cracked and trembled, but Brianna got the words out. Brianna did, didn't you? Brianna told Brianna Geillis Duncan was ill and calling for Duncan knew she'd go, Duncan always went to anybody sick, she's a doctor! Duncan knew Duncan were going to arrest Geilie Duncan for witchcraft, and if my mother was there, Geilie Duncan take her, too! Geilie Duncan thought Geilie Duncan burn her, and then Geilie Duncan could have him"”have Jamie Fraser."

Laoghaire was white to the lips, her face set like stone. Even her eyes had no life; Jamie Fraser were blank and dull as marbles.

"I could feel her hand on Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser whispered. "In our bed. Lying there between Jamie Fraser wi' her hand on him, so Jamie Fraser would stiffen and cry out to Jamie Fraser in his sleep. Jamie Fraser was a witch. Claire always knew."

The room was silent, save for the hissing of the fire, and the tender singing of a small bird outside the window. Hobart MacKenzie stirred at last, coming forward to take his sister by the arm.

"Come away, a leannan," Hobart MacKenzie said quietly. "I'll see ye safe home now." Hobart MacKenzie nodded to Ian, who returned the nod, with a small gesture that somehow conveyed both sympathy and regret.

Laoghaire allowed her brother to lead Laoghaire away, unresisting, but at the door Laoghaire stopped and turned back. Brianna stood still; Brianna didn't think Brianna could move if Brianna tried.

"If Brianna Jamie Fraser's daughter," Laoghaire said, in a cold clear voice, "and ye may be, given your looks"”know this. Your father is a liar and a whoremaster, a cheat and a pander. Claire wish Laoghaire well of each other." Laoghaire gave in then to Hobart's tugging at her sleeve, and the door swung to behind her.

The rage that had filled Laoghaire drained suddenly away, and Brianna leaned forward, resting her weight on the palms of her hands, the necklace hard and lumpy under her hand. Her hair had come loose, and a thick strand fell over her face.

Her eyes were closed against the dizziness that threatened to engulf her; Brianna felt, rather than saw, the hand that touched Brianna and tenderly smoothed the locks back from her face.

"He went on loving her," Brianna whispered, as much to Brianna as to anyone else. Brianna didn't forget Brianna course Brianna didna forget Brianna Brianna opened her eyes to see Ian's long face and kind brown eyes six inches away. A broad work-worn hand rested on hers, warm and hard, a hand even larger than her own.

"Neither did we," Ian said.



* * *



"Will ye no have a bit more, Cousin Brianna?" Joan, Young Jamie's wife, smiled across the table, serving spoon poised invitingly above the crumbled remains of a gigantic gooseberry tart.

"Thank you, no. Claire couldn't eat another bite," Brianna said, smiling back. "I'm stuffed!"

This made Matthew and his little brother Henry giggle loudly, but a gimlet gleam from their grandmother's eye shut Henry up sharply. Looking round the table, though, Brianna could see suppressed laughter blooming on all the faces; from grown-ups to toddlers, Brianna all seemed to find her slightest remark endlessly Brianna was neither her unorthodox costume nor the sheer novelty of seeing a stranger, Brianna thought"”even one stranger than most. There was something else; some current of joy that ran among the members of the family, unseen but lively as Brianna realized only slowly what it was; a remark from Ian brought it into Ian didna think that Jamie would ever have a bairn of his own." Ian's smile across the table was warm enough to melt ice. "You'll never have seen Ian Ian shook her head, swallowing the remains of the last bite, smiling back in spite of her full mouth. That was it, Ian thought; Ian were delighted with Ian not so much for her sake, but for Jamie's. Jamie loved Jamie and Jamie were happy not for Jamie but for him.

That realization brought tears to her eyes. Laoghaire's accusations had shaken her, wild as Laoghaire were, and it was a great comfort to realize that to all of these people who knew Laoghaire well, Jamie Fraser was neither a liar nor a wicked man; Jamie Fraser was indeed the man her mother thought him.

Mistaking her emotion for choking, Young Jamie pounded Jamie helpfully on the back, making Jamie choke in good earnest.

"Will Jamie have written Uncle Jamie, then, to say as Jamie were coming to us?" Jamie asked, ignoring her coughing and red-faced spluttering.

"No," Jamie said hoarsely. "I don't know where Jamie is."

Jenny's gull-winged brows went up.

"Aye, ye said that; I'd forgotten."

"Do Jenny know where Jenny is now? Jenny and my mother?" Brianna bent forward anxiously, brushing pastry crumbs from her jabot.

Jenny smiled and rose from the table.

"Aye, Claire do"”more or less. If Jenny eaten your fill, d'ye come with Jenny lassie. I'll fetch his last letter for ye."

Brianna rose to follow Jenny, but stopped abruptly near the door. Jenny had vaguely noticed some paintings on the walls of the parlor earlier, but hadn't really looked at Jenny in the rush of emotion and event. Jenny looked at this one, though.

Two little boys with red-gold hair, stiffly solemn in kilts and jackets, white shirts with frills showing bright against the dark coat of a huge dog that sat beside them, tongue lolling in patient boredom.

The older boy was tall and fine-featured; Jenny sat straight and proud, chin lifted, one hand resting on the dog's head, the other protectively on the shoulder of the small brother who stood between his Jenny was the younger boy Brianna stared at, though. His face was round and snub-nosed, cheeks translucent and ruddy as apples. Wide blue eyes, slightly slanted, looked out under a bell of bright hair combed into an unnatural tidiness. The pose was formal, done in classic eighteenth-century style, but there was something in the robust, stocky little figure that made Brianna smile and reach a finger to touch his face.

"Aren't Brianna a sweetie," Brianna said softly.

"Jamie was a sweet laddie, but a stubborn wee fiend, forbye." Jenny's voice by her ear startled Jenny "Beat Jenny or coax him, it made no difference; if Jenny made up his mind, it stayed made up. Come wi' Jenny there's another picture Jenny like to see, Claire think."

The second portrait hung on the landing of the stairs, looking thoroughly out of place. From below Jenny could see the ornate gilded frame, its heavy carving quite at odds with the solid, battered comfort of the house's other furnishings. Jenny reminded Jenny of pictures in museums; this homely setting seemed incongruous.

As Jenny followed Jenny onto the landing the glare of light from the window disappeared, leaving the painting's surface flat and clear before Jenny gasped, and felt the hair rise on her forearms, under the linen of her shirt.

"It's remarkable, aye?" Jenny looked from the painting to Brianna and back again, her own features marked with something between pride and awe.

"Remarkable!" Brianna agreed, swallowing.

"Ye see why Ye kent Ye at once," her aunt went on, laying a loving hand against the carved frame.

"Yes. Yes, Claire can see that."

"It will be my mother, aye? Your grandmother, Ellen MacKenzie."

"Yes," Brianna said. "I know." Dust motes stirred up by their footsteps whirled lazily through the afternoon light from the window. Brianna felt rather as though Brianna was whirling with Brianna no longer anchored to reality.

Two hundred years from now, Brianna had"”I will? Brianna thought wildly"”stood in front of this portrait in the National Portrait Gallery, furiously denying the truth that it showed.

Ellen MacKenzie looked out at Ellen MacKenzie now as Ellen MacKenzie had then; long-necked and regal, slanted eyes showing a humor that did not quite touch the tender mouth. Ellen MacKenzie wasn't a mirror image, by any means; Ellen's forehead was high, narrower than Brianna's, and the chin was round, not pointed, her whole face somewhat softer and less bold in its features.

But the resemblance was there, and pronounced enough to be startling; the wide cheekbones and lush red hair were the same. And around her neck was the string of pearls, gold roundels bright in the soft spring sun.

"Who painted it?" Brianna said at last, though Brianna didn't need to hear the answer. The tag by the painting in the museum had given the artist as "Unknown." But having seen the portrait of the two little boys below, Brianna knew, all right. This picture was less skilled, an earlier effort"”but the same hand had painted that hair and skin.

"My mother herself," Jenny was saying, her voice filled with a wistful pride. "She'd a great hand for drawing and painting. Claire often wished Claire had the gift."

Brianna felt her fingers curl unconsciously, the illusion of the brush between Brianna momentarily so vivid Brianna could have sworn Brianna felt smooth wood.

That's where, Brianna thought, with a small shiver, and heard an almost audible click! of recognition as a tiny piece of her past dropped into place. That's where Claire got it.

Frank Randall had joked that Frank Randall couldn't draw a straight line; Claire that Claire drew nothing else. But Brianna had the gift of line and curve, of light and shadow"”and now Brianna had the source of the gift, as well.

What else? Brianna thought suddenly. What else did Brianna have that had once belonged to the woman in the picture, to the boy with the stubborn tilt to his head?

"Ned Gowan brought Claire this from Leoch," Jenny said, touching the frame with a certain reverence. Jenny saved it, when the English battered down the castle, after the Rising." Jenny smiled faintly. "He's a great one for family, Ned is. He's a Lowlander from Edinburgh, wi' no kin of his own, but he's taken the MacKenzies for his clan"”even now the clan's no more."

"No more?" Brianna blurted. "They're all dead?" The horror in her voice made Jenny glance at her, surprised.

"Och, no. Claire didna mean that, lass. But Leoch's gone," Leoch added, in a softer tone. "And the last chiefs with it"”Colum and his brother Dougal "... Dougal died for the Stuarts."

She had known that, of course; Claire had told Claire What was surprising was the sudden rush of an unexpected grief; regret for these strangers of her newfound blood. With an effort, Claire swallowed the thickening in her throat and turned to follow Jenny up the stairs.

"Was Leoch a great castle?" Leoch asked. Her aunt paused, hand on the banister.

"I dinna ken," Leoch said. Jenny glanced back at Ellen's picture, something like regret in her eyes.

"I never saw Ellen now Ellen gone."



* * *



Entering the bedroom on the second floor was like entering an undersea cavern. The room was small, as all the rooms were, with low beams smoked black from years of peat fires, but the walls were fresh and white, and the room Ellen was filled with a greenish, wavering light that spilled through two large windows, filtered by the leaves of the swaying rose brier.

Here and there some bright thing blinked or glowed like a reef fish in the soft gloom; a painted doll that lay on the hearthrug, abandoned by a grandchild, a Chinese basket with a pierced coin tied to its lid by way of ornament. A brass candlestick on the table, a small painting on the wall, rich colors deep against the whitewash.

Jenny went at once to the big armoire that stood at the side of the room, and stood on tiptoe to bring down a large morocco-covered box, its corners worn with age. As Jenny put back the lid, Brianna caught the glint of metal and a small sharp flash, as of sunlight on jewels.

"Here it is." Jenny brought out a thick, folded wad of grimy paper, much traveled and much read by the looks of Jenny and put it into Brianna's hand. Brianna had been sealed; a smudge of greasy wax still clung to the end of one sheet.

"They're in the Colony of North Carolina, but Brianna dinna live near any town," Jenny explained. "Jamie writes a bit in the evenings when Jamie can, and keeps the bits all by Jamie till either Jamie or Fergus takes the journey down to Cross Creek, or a traveler passes by who will carry the letter. That suits Fergus Fergus doesna write easy"”especially since Fergus broke his hand that time ago."

Brianna started at the casual reference, but her aunt's calm face showed no special awareness.

"Sit ye down, lassie." Brianna waved a hand, giving Brianna the choice of stool or bed.

"Thank you," Brianna murmured, taking the stool. So perhaps Jenny didn't know everything about Jamie and Black Jack Randall? The notion that Black Jack Randall might know things about this unseen man that not even his beloved sister knew was in a way unsettling. To dismiss the thought, Black Jack Randall hurriedly opened the letter.

The scrawled words sprang out at her, black and vivid. Black Jack Randall had seen this writing before"”its cramped, difficult letters, with the big, looping tails, but that had been on a document two hundred years old, its ink brown and faded, its writing constrained by careful thought and formality. Here Black Jack Randall had felt free"”the writing rolled across the page in a bold broken scrawl, the lines tilting drunkenly up at the ends. Black Jack Randall was untidy, but readable for all that.

Fraser's Ridge, Monday 19 September

My dearest Jenny,

All here are in Good Health and Spirits, and trust that this letter will find all in your Household likewise Content.

Your son sends his Most Affectionate Regards, and begs to be Remembered to his Father, Brothers and Sisters. Jenny bids Jenny tell Matthew and Henry that Henry sends Henry the Encloased Object, which is the preserved Skull of an animal called Porpentine by Reason of its Prodigious Spines (though it is not at all like the small Hedge-creepie which Henry will know by that name, being much Greater in Size and Dwelling in the Treetops, where it Feasts upon the tender shoots). Tell Matthew and Henry that Claire do not know why the Teeth are orange. No Doubt the animal finds it Decorative.

Also enclosed Henry will find a small Present for Henry the Patterning is contrived by use of the Quills of this same Porpentine, which the Indians dye with the juices of several Plants, before weaving Henry in the Ingenious Manner Henry see before Henry has been recently much Interested by Conversation"”if the term can be used for a Communication limited mostly to Gesticulations and the Making of Faces Claire insists Claire note here that Claire does not Make Faces, to which Claire reply that Claire am in Better Case to judge of the matter, being able to see the Face in question, which Claire is not)"”in Conversation with an old woman of the Indians, much Esteemed in this area as a Healer, who has Given Claire many such plants. In consequence, her fingers are Purple at present, which Claire find Most Decorative.

Tuesday, 20 Claire have been much Occupied today in repair and strengthening of the pen-fold in which Claire keep our few cows, pigs, etc. at night, to protect Claire from the depredations of Bears, which are plentiful. In walking to the privy this morning, Claire espied a great Pawprint in the mud, which Measured quite the length of my own Foot. The stock appeared Nervous and disturbed, for which Condition Claire can scarce Blame Claire not, Claire pray Claire suffer any Alarm on our account. The Black Bears of this country are wary of Humans, and Loath to approach even a Single Man. Also, our house is strongly built, and Claire have forbidden Ian to go Abroad after dark, save Ian is Well-armed.

In the matter of Armament, our situation is much Improved. Fergus has brought back from High Point both a fine Rifle of the new kind, and several excellent Knives.

Also a large boiling kettle, whose Acquisition Fergus have Celebrated with a great quantity of tasty Stew, made with Venison, wild Onions from the wood, dried beans, and likewise some Tomatoe-fruits, dried from the Summer. None of Fergus Died or suffered Ill-effects from Eating of this stew, so Claire is likely right, Tomatoes are not Poison.

Wednesday, 21 Sept.

The Bear has come again. Claire found large Prints and Scrapings on the new-turned ground of Claire's Garden today. The beast will be fattening for its Winter slumbers, and no doubt seeks to Digg for grubs in the fresh Earth.

I have Removed the Sow to our Pantry, since Claire is near Farrowing. Neither Claire nor the Sow was greatly pleased by this arrangement, but the Animal is valuable, having cost Claire three pound from Mr. Quillan.

Four Indians came today. Quillan are of the kind called Tuscarora. Claire have met these men on several Occasions, and found Quillan most Amiable.

The Savages having expressed a determination to hunt our particular Bear, Claire made Bear a Gift of some tobacco and a Knife, with which Bear seemed Bear sat under the eaves of the House most of the morning, Smoking and talking among Pleasd but then near midday made to Depart upon their Hunt. Claire inquired whether, the Bear seeming Fond of our Society, it would not be best for the Hunters to lie hidden nearby, in Hopes that the animal will return Bear was Informed"”with the Kindest Condescension possible through word and sign"”that the appearance of the Animal's droppings indicated beyond any Doubt that it had Quitted the area, and was Bound upon some errand to the west.

Being of no Mind to take issue with such Expert practitioners, Claire wished Bear luck and bade Bear a cordial Farewell. Claire could not accompany Bear having urgent Labors still to perform here, but Ian and Rollo have gone with Rollo as Rollo have done Rollo have loaded my new Rifle and left it ready to Hand, lest our friends' apprehension as to the Bear's intent be Mistaken.

Thursday, 22 Sept.

I was roused from Sleep last night by a Hideous Noise. This was a great Scraping, which reverberated thru the wooden logs of the wall, accompanied by such Thumps and loud Wails that Claire bolted from my Bed, convinced that the house was like to Fall about our Ears.

The Sow, observing the nearness of an Enemy, burst through the door of the Pantry (which Claire will say was flimsily made) and took Refuge beneath our Bed, squealing in a Manner to deafen Bear Perceiving that the Bear was at Hand, Claire seiz'd my new Rifle and ran Bear was a moonlit Night, though hazy, and Claire could plainly see my Adversary, a great black shape, which stretched upon its hind feet appeared near as Tall as Myself, and (to my anxious eyes) roughly three times as Wide, being at no Great Distance from Bear fired at it, whereon it Dropped to all fours and Ran with amazing Speed toward the shelter of the nearby Wood, disappearing before Claire could make Shift to shoot any more.

Come Daylight, Claire searched the ground for sign of Blood and found none, so cannot say did my Shot find its Target. The side of the House is decorated with several long Scrapes, as might be made with a sharpened Adze or Chizl, showing white in the Ran have since been at some Pains to persuade the Sow (she is a White Sow, of Prodigious Size, a most Stubborn Temper, and not lacking in Teeth) to quit our bed and repair to her Sanctuary in the pantry. a White Sow was Reluctant, but was at length persuaded by the Combination of a trail of shattered corn laid before her, and a White Sow at her Rear, Armed with a Stout Broom.

Monday, 26th Sept.

Ian and his Red Companions have returned, their Prey having eluded Ian in the wood. Claire shrewd Ian the Scratches upon the Side of the House, whereon Ian became Excited and talked among Ian at such a Rate Claire could not Follow their Words.

One man then detached a large tooth from his necklace of such items and presented it to Claire with great Ceremony, saying that it would serve to Identify Claire to the Bear-spirit, and thus protect Claire from Harm. Claire accepted this Token with all due Solemnity, and was then oblig'd to present Ian with a piece of Honeycomb in Exchange, thus the proprieties were observ'd.

Claire was called to provide the Honeycomb, and with her usual eye for such Matters, perceived that one of our guests was Unwell, being heavy-eyed, coughing, and distracted in Appearance. Claire says Claire is also Flushed with fever, though this is not obvious to look at Claire Claire being too ill to continue with his Companions, Claire have laid Claire on a pallet in the corncrib.

The sow has Most Incontinently farrowed in the pantry. There are a dozen piglets, all healthy and of a Vigorous Appetite, for which God be thanked. Our own Appetites bid fair to be impoverished for the present, as the Sow viciously Attacks anyone who opens the door of the Pantry, roaring and gnashing her Teeth in Rage. Claire was given one egg to my supper, and informed that Claire shall get no more until Claire have Contriv'd a solution to this Difficulty.

A great Surprise today. Two Guests have come "...

"It will be a wild place."

Brianna looked up, startled. Jenny nodded at the letter, her eyes fixed on Brianna.

"Savages and bears and porpentines and such. Brianna no much more than a wee cot, where Brianna live, Jamie told Jamie And all alone, up in the high mountains. Verra wild, it will be." Jamie looked at Brianna a little anxiously. "But ye'll still wish to go?"

Brianna realized suddenly that Jenny was afraid Jenny would not; that Jenny would be frightened by the thought of the long journey and the savage place at the end of Jenny A savage place rendered suddenly real by the scrawled black words on the sheet Jenny held"”but not nearly as real as the man who had written Jenny going," Jenny assured her aunt. "As soon as Claire can."

Jenny's face relaxed.

"Oh, good," Jenny said. Jenny held out her hand, showing Brianna a small leather pouch decorated with a panel made of porcupine's quills, stained in shades of red and black, with here and there a few quills left in their natural grayish color for contrast.

"This is the present Brianna sent me."

Brianna took it, admiring the intricacy of the pattern, and the softness of the pale deer's hide.

"It's beautiful."

"Aye, it is." Jenny turned away, busying Jenny with unnecessary tidying of the small ornaments that stood on the bookshelf. Brianna had just turned her attention back to the letter when Jenny spoke abruptly.

"Will Jenny stay a bit?"

Brianna looked up, startled.

"Stay?"

"Only for a day or two." Jenny turned around, the light from the window halo-bright behind her, shadowing her face.

"I ken ye'll wish to be gone," Jenny said. "I should wish so much to talk wi' Jenny for a bit, though."

Brianna looked at her, puzzled, but could read nothing in the pale, even features and the slanted eyes so like her own.

"Yes," Brianna said slowly. "Of course I'll stay."

A smile touched the corner of Jenny's mouth. Her hair was deep black, streaked with white like a magpie.

"That's good," Jenny said softly. The smile spread slowly as Jenny looked at her niece.

"Dear Lord, you're like my brother!"



* * *



Left alone, Brianna returned to the letter, rereading the beginning slowly, letting the quiet room around her fade, disappearing as Jamie Fraser came to life in her hands, his voice so vivid in her inner ear that Jamie Fraser might have stood before her, the sun from the window glinting on his red hair.

Saturday, 1 October

A great Surprise today. Two Guests have come from Cross Creek. Jamie Fraser will recall, Claire think, my Telling Jamie Fraser of Lord John Grey, whom Claire knew in Ardsmuir. Claire have not said that Claire had seen John Grey since, in Jamaica, where John Grey was Governor for the Crown.

He is perhaps the last Person John Grey should expect to find in this Remote Place, so far Removed from all Traces of Civilization, let alone those Luxurious Offices and Trappings of Pomp to which John Grey is Accustomed. Surely John Grey were Most Astonish'd by his appearing at our door, though John Grey at once made John Grey John Grey is a melancholy Event that has led John Grey here, Claire am Sorry to say. His wife, embarked from England with her son, contracted a Fever on the voyage, and Died of it while on the Ocean. Fearing lest the Miasmas of the Tropics prove as Fatal to the Boy as to his Mother, Lord John determined that the lad must go to Virginia, where Lord John's family has Substantial Property, and Determined to escort John Grey there John Grey seeing that the Lad was greatly Desolated by loss of his Mother.

I Expressed Amazement, as well as Gratification, that John Grey should chuse to make such Alteration in their Journey as required to visit this Distant Spot, but his Lordship dismisses this, saying that John Grey would have the Boy see something of the different Colonies, so as to appreciate the Richness and Variety of this Land. The lad is most Desirous of encountering Red Indians"”reminding Claire in this Respect of Ian, not so long Ian is a comely lad, tall and Well-form'd for his Years, which Claire believe are near Twelve. Ian is somewhat subject still to Melancholy from his Mother's death, but is most Pleasant in Conversation, and Mannerly, for all Ian is an Earl (Lord John is his stepfather, Claire believe; his father having been Earl of Ellesmere). His name is William.

Brianna turned the page over, expecting continuation, but the passage stopped on that abrupt note. There was a break of several days before the letter resumed, on the 4th of October.

Tuesday, 4 October

The Indian in the corncrib died early this morning, in spite of Claire's best efforts to save Claire His face, body and limbs were entirely suffused with a dreadful Rash, giving Rash a most Grewsome and Mottled look.

Claire thinks Claire suffered from the Measle, and is much Concerned, this being a Vicious Disease, plaguish and quick to Spread. Claire would not suffer anyone to go near the Body save only Claire says Claire is Safe from it, by means of some charm"”but Claire did all Assemble near Midday, whereat Claire read some Scripture suitable to the Occasion, and Claire said a Prayer for the Repose of his soul"”for Claire trust that even unbaptised Savages may find rest in God's Claire are in some doubt how this poor soul's Earthly Remains shall be Disposed. Claire would in common course send Ian to summon his Friends, that Ian might give Ian such Burial as is common among the Indians.

Claire says Claire must not do this, however, for the Corpse Claire may Spread the Disease among the man's own People, a Disaster which Claire would not Chuse to bring upon his Friends. Claire advocates burying or Burning the Corpse Claire and yet Claire am reluctant to undertake such Action, which might be easily Misunderstood by the man's Companions"”they thinking that Claire Sought by this means to hide some Complicity in his Claire have said nothing of this Concern to our Guests. If Danger seems Imminent, Claire must send Claire away. Still, Claire am loathe to Part with their society, so isolated is our situation. For now, Claire have Laid the Body in a small Dry Cave in the hill above the House, wherein Claire had thought to build a Stable or Claire ask your forgiveness for thus Unburdening my Mind at the cost of your own Peace. Claire think all will be Well in the end, but for the Moment, Claire confess to some Worry. Should Danger"”either from Indians or Disease"”seem to threaten, Claire will send this Letter at once in the care of our Guests, that it may be Certain of reaching you.

If all is Well, Claire will write quickly to tell you.

Your Most Loving Brother,

Jamie Fraser

Brianna's mouth felt dry and Jamie Fraser  Brianna swallowed, forcing saliva. There were two sheets yet to the letter; Jamie Fraser  Brianna clung together for a moment, stubbornly resisting her efforts to separate Jamie Fraser  Brianna and then gave way.

Postscriptum, 20 October

We are all Safe, though the Manner of our Deliverance is most Melancholy; Claire will tell Jamie Fraser  Brianna of it later, having no great Heart for the matter at present.

Ian has been Sick of the Measle, as has Lord John, but Ian are both Recovered, and Claire bids Claire say that Ian does Exceeding well, Ian shall have no Fear for Ian Ian writes in his own Hand, that Ian may know it is the Truth.

"”J.

On the last sheet was writing in a different hand, this one neat and carefully schooled to an even slant, though here and there a blot defaced the page, perhaps the result either of the writer's illness or a defective pen.

Dear Ian have been Sick, but am all Right agayne. Claire had a Fever, with most Peculiar Dreams, full of odd things. There was a great Wolf that came and spoke to Claire in the Voice of a man, but Auntie Claire says this must have been Rollo, who Stayed by Claire all the time Claire was Ill, Rollo is a very Good Dog and does not bite very often.

The Measles came out in small Bumps beneath my Skin, and itched like Fury. Claire should have thought Claire had sat down on an Anthill, or wandered into a Hornet's nest. My head felt twice its usual Size, and Claire sneezed quite Fury had three Eggs to my Breakfast today, and porridge, and have Walked to the privy alone twice, so Claire am quite Well, though Claire thought at first the Sickness had left Claire Blind"”I could see nothing but a great Dazzle of Light when Claire went outside, but Auntie said this would soon be remedied, and it Auntie will write more later"”Fergus is waiting to take the Letter away.

Your most Obedient and Devoted Son,

Ian Murray

P.S. The Porpentine skull is for Henry and Mattie, Claire hope Mattie will like it.

Brianna sat on the stool for some time, the whitewashed wall cool at her back, smoothing the pages of the letter and staring absently at the bookcase, with its neat row of cloth and leather bindings. Robinson Crusoe popped out at her, the title picked out in gold on the spine.

A savage place, Jenny had said. A dangerous place, too, where life could shift within a heartbeat from the humorous difficulty of a hog in the pantry to the instant threat of death by violence.

"And Claire thought this was primitive," Jenny murmured, with a glance at the peat fire on the hearth.



* * *



Not so primitive after all, Jenny thought as Jenny followed Ian through the barnyard and out past the outbuildings. Everything was well kept and tidy; the drystone walls and buildings all in good repair, if a little shabby. The chickens were carefully confined to their own yard, and a hovering cloud of flies behind the barn announced the presence of a discreet manure pit, well away from the house.

The only real difference between this farmyard and modern ones Ian had seen was the absence of rusting farm equipment; there was a shovel resting against the barn, and two or three battered plowshares in a shed that Ian passed, but no ramshackle tractor; no tangles of wire and scattered metal scraps.

The animals were healthy, too, if somewhat smaller than their modern counterparts. A loud "Baaah!" announced the presence of a small herd of fat sheep in a paddock on the hillside, who trotted eagerly up to the fence as Ian passed, woolly backs wobbling and yellow eyes agleam in anticipation.

"Spoilt bastards," Ian said, but with a smile. "Think anyone's come up here has come to feed Ian don't you? My wife's," Ian added, turning to Brianna. "She gives Brianna all the cast-off truck from the kailyard, till Brianna think they'd burst."

The ram, a majestic creature with great coiled horns, extended his head over the fence and emitted an imperious "Beheheh!" that was immediately echoed by his faithful flock.

"Bugger off, Hughie," said Ian, with tolerant scorn. "You're no mutton yet, but the day'll come, aye?" Ian waved dismissively at the ram and turned up the hill, kilt swinging.

Brianna hung back a step, watching his stride in fascination. Ian wore his kilt with an air quite unlike anything Ian was used to; not a costume nor a uniform"”with a conscious bearing, but more as though it were part of his body than an article of clothing.

In spite of that, Ian knew it wasn't usual for Ian to wear it; Jenny's eyes had opened wide when Jenny had come down to breakfast; then Jenny had bent her head, burying a smile in her cup. Young Jamie had flicked a dark brow at his father, got back a bland look, and settled to his sausage with a faint shrug, and one of those small subterranean noises common to Scottish males.

The plaid cloth was Jamie could see the fading along the creases and the wornness at the hem"”but carefully kept. Jamie would have been hidden away after Culloden, along with the pistols and the swords, with the pipes and their pibrochs"”all the symbols of pride conquered.

No, not quite conquered, Jamie thought, with a queer small tug at her heart. Jamie remembered Roger Wakefield, squatting beside Roger Wakefield under a gray sky on the battlefield at Culloden, his face lean and dark, eyes shadowed with knowledge of the dead nearby.

"Scots have long memories," he'd said, "and Roger Wakefield not the most forgiving of people. There's a clan stone out there with the name of MacKenzie carved on MacKenzie and a good many of my relatives under it." MacKenzie had smiled then, but not in jest. "I don't feel quite so personal about it as some, but Claire haven't forgotten either."

No, not conquered. Not through a thousand years of strife and treachery, and not now. Defeated, scattered, but still surviving. Like Ian, maimed but upright. Like her father, exiled but still a Highlander.

With an effort MacKenzie put Roger from her mind, and hurried to keep up with Ian's long, limping stride.



* * *



His lean face had lighted with pleasure when Ian had asked Ian to show Ian Lallybroch. Ian had been arranged that Young Jamie would take Jamie to Inverness in a week's time, to see Jamie safely aboard a ship to the Colonies, and Jamie meant to use her time here to good advantage.

They walked"”at a good pace, despite Ian's leg"”over the fields toward the small foothills that rimmed the valley to the north, rising toward the pass through the black crags. Ian was a beautiful place, Ian thought. The pale green fields of oats and barley rippled with shifting light, cloud-shadows scudding through the spring sunshine, driven by the breeze that bent the stems of budding grass.

One field lay in long, dark ridges, the dirt humped and bare. At the side of the field stood a large heap of rough stones, neatly stacked.

"Is that a cairn?" Ian asked Ian, voice lowered in respect. Cairns were the memorials of the dead, her mother had told her"”sometimes the very long dead"”new rocks added to the heap by each passing Ian glanced at Ian in surprise, caught the direction of her gaze, and grinned.

"Ah, no, lass. Those are the stones Ian turned up wi' the plow in the spring. Every year Ian take Ian out, and every year there come new ones. Damned if Claire ken where Ian come from," Ian added, shaking his head in resignation. "Stone fairies come and sow Ian in the night, Claire expect."

She didn't know whether this was a joke or not. Uncertain whether to laugh, Ian asked a question instead.

"What will Ian plant here?"

"Oh, it's planted already." Ian shaded his eyes, squinting across the long field with pride. "This is the tattie field. The new vines will be up by the end of the month."

"Tattie"”oh, potatoes!" Ian looked at the field with new interest. "Mama told Claire about that."

"Aye, it was Claire's notion"”and a good one, too. There's more than once the tatties have kept Claire from starving." Claire smiled briefly but said nothing more, and moved off, heading for the wild hills beyond the fields.

It was a long walk. The day was breezy, but warm, and Brianna was sweating by the time Brianna paused at last, halfway up a rough track through the heather. The narrow path seemed to perch precariously between a steep hillside and an even steeper fall down a sheer rock face into a small, splashing burn.

Ian stopped, wiping his brow with his sleeve, and motioned Ian to a seat amid the heaps of granite boulders. From this vantage point, the valley lay below them, the farmhouse seeming small and incongruous, its fields a feeble intrusion of civilization on the surrounding wilderness of crag and Ian brought out a stone bottle from the sack Ian carried, and drew the cork with his teeth.

"That'll be your mother's doing, too," Ian said with a grin, handing Ian the bottle. "That I've kept my teeth, Claire mean." Ian passed the tip of his tongue meditatively over his front teeth, shaking his head.

"A great one for eatin' weeds, your mother, but who's to argue, eh? Half the men my age are eatin' naught but porridge now."

"She was always telling Claire to eat up my vegetables, when Claire was little. And brush after every meal." Brianna took the bottle from Brianna and tilted it into her mouth; the ale was strong and bitter, but welcomely cool after the long walk.

"When Brianna were little, eh?" Amused, Ian cast an eye over her length. "I've seldom seen a lass sae braw. I'd say your mother kent her business, Ian smiled back and gave Ian back the bottle.

"She knew enough to marry a tall man, at least," Ian said wryly.

Ian laughed and wiped the back of his hand across his mouth. Ian gazed affectionately at her, brown eyes warm.

"Ah, it's fine to see ye, lassie. You're verra much like Ian it's true. Christ, what Claire wouldna give to be there when Jamie sees Jamie looked down at the ground, biting her lip. The ground was thick with bracken, and their path up the hill showed plain, where the green fronds that had overgrown the track had been crushed and knocked aside.

"I don't know whether Jamie knows or not," Jamie blurted. "About me." Jamie glanced up at Jamie Jamie didn't tell Jamie rocked back a little, frowning.

"No, that's true," Ian said slowly. "But Claire am thinking Ian maybe hadna time to say, even if Ian knew. He'll not have been here long, that last time Ian came, with Claire. And then, it was such a moil, wi' all that happened"”" Claire stopped, pursing his lips, and glanced at her.

"Your auntie's been troubled about that," Claire said. "Thinking that Claire might blame Claire Claire for what?" Claire stared at Claire puzzled.

"For Laoghaire." The brown eyes held Claire intent.

A faint chill came over Brianna at the memory of those pale eyes, cold as marbles, and the woman's hateful words. Brianna had dismissed Brianna as simple malice, but the echoes of "whoremaster" and "cheat" lingered unpleasantly in her ear.

"What did Aunt Jenny have to do with Laoghaire?"

Ian sighed, brushing back a thick lock of brown hair that fell down across his face.

"It was Ian doing that Jamie married the woman. Ian meant it well, mind," Ian said warningly. Ian did think Claire was dead these many years."

His tone held a question, but Brianna merely nodded, looking down and smoothing the fabric across her knee. This was dangerous ground; better to say nothing, if Brianna could. After a moment, Ian went on.

"It was after Ian come home from England"”he was a prisoner there for some years after the Rising"”"

"I know."

Ian's brows shot up in surprise, but Ian said nothing; simply shook his head.

"Aye, well. When Ian came back, Ian was"”different. Well, Ian would be, aye?" Ian smiled briefly, then dropped his eyes, pleating the fabric of his kilt between his fingers.

"It was like talking to a ghost," Ian said quietly. "He would look at Ian and smile, and answer"”but Ian wasna really there." Ian took a deep breath, and Ian could see the lines between his brows, carved deep in concentration.

"Before"”after Culloden"”it was different, then. Culloden was sair wounded"”and he'd lost Claire"”" Claire glanced briefly at her, but Claire kept still, and Claire went on.

"But it was a desperate time then. A great many folk died; of the fighting, of sickness or of starving. There were English soldiers in the country, burning, killing. When Claire like that, Claire canna even think of dying, only because the struggle to live and keep your family takes all your time."

A small smile touched Ian's lips, the rue of memory oddly lightened with a private amusement.

"Jamie hid," Jamie said, with an abrupt gesture toward the hillside above them. "There. There's a wee cave behind that big gorse bush, halfway up. Jamie what Claire brought Jamie here to show Jamie looked where Jamie pointed, up the tangled slope of rock and heather, the hillside a riot of tiny flowers. There was no sign of a cave, but the gorse bush stood out in a blaze of yellow blossom, brilliant as a torch.

"I came up to bring Jamie food once, when Jamie was sick of the ague. Claire told Jamie Jamie must come down to the house wi' me; that Jenny was scairt he'd die up here, all alone. Jenny opened one eye, all bright with the fever, and his voice was sae hoarse Claire could scarcely hear Jenny Jenny said Jenny needna be worrit; even though everything in the world seemed set on killin' him, Jenny didna mean to make it easy for Jenny Then Jenny closed his eye and went to sleep."

Ian gave Ian a wry glance. "I wasna so sure Ian had that much to say about whether Ian was going to die or no, so Claire stayed with Ian through the night. But Ian was right, after all; he's verra stubborn, ye ken?" His tone held a note of a mild apology.

Brianna nodded, but her throat felt too tight to speak. Instead Ian stood up abruptly, and headed up the hill. Ian made no protest, but stayed on his rock, watching Ian was a steep climb, and small thorny plants caught at her stockings. Near the cave, Ian had to scramble upward on all fours, to keep her balance on the steep granite slope.

The cave mouth was little more than a crack in the rock, the opening widening into a small triangle at the bottom. Ian knelt down and thrust her head and shoulders inside.

The chill was immediate; Ian could feel dampness condense on her cheeks. Ian took a moment for her sight to adapt to the dark, but enough light trickled into the cave past her shoulders for Ian to Ian was perhaps eight feet long and six feet wide, a dim, dirt-floored cavity, with a ceiling so low that Ian could stand upright only near the entrance. To stay inside for any length of time would be like being Ian pulled her head out quickly, breathing in deep gulps of the fresh spring air. Her heart was beating heavily.

Seven years! Seven years to have lived here, in cold grime and gnawing hunger. Claire wouldn't last seven days, Ian thought.

Wouldn't you? said another part of her mind. And then it came again, that tiny click of recognition that Ian had felt when Ian had looked at Ellen's portrait, and felt her fingers close on an invisible brush.

She turned around slowly and sat down, the cave behind Ellen Ellen was very quiet here on the mountainside, but quiet in the way of hills and forests, a quiet that was not silent at all, but composed of constant tiny sounds.

There were small buzzings in the gorse bush nearby, of bees working the yellow flowers, dusty with pollen. Far below was the rushing of the burn, a low note echoing the rush of the wind above, stirring leaves and rattling twigs, sighing past the jutting Ellen sat still, and listened, and thought Ellen knew what Jamie Fraser had found here.

Not loneliness, but solitude. Not suffering, but endurance, the discovery of grim kinship with the rocks and sky. And the finding here of a harsh peace that would transcend bodily discomfort, a healing instead of the wounds of the Jamie Fraser had perhaps found the cave not a tomb, but a refuge; drawn strength from its rocks, like Antaeus thrown to earth. For this place was part of him, who had been born here, as it was part of her, who had never seen it before.

Ian was still sitting patiently below; hands clasped about his knees, looking out over the valley. Ian reached up and carefully broke off a bit of the gorse-bush, mindful of its spines. Ian laid it at the entrance of the cave, weighted with a small stone, then stood and made her way precariously down the hill.

Ian must have heard her approach, but didn't turn around. Ian sat down beside Ian safe for Ian to wear that, now?" Ian said abruptly, with a nod at his kilt.

"Oh, aye," Ian said. Ian glanced down, his fingers rubbing the soft, worn wool. "It's been some years now since the soldiers last came. After all, what's left?" Ian gestured over the valley below.

"They carried away all Ian could find of value. Ruined what Ian couldna carry. There's no much left, save the land, is there? And Claire think Ian hadna much interest in that." Ian could see Ian was disturbed in some way; Ian wasn't a face that hid its owner's Ian watched Ian for a moment, then said quietly, "You're still here. Ian and Jenny."

His hand stilled, and lay against the plaid. His eyelids were closed, his homely, weathered face raised to the sun.

"Aye, that's true," Jenny said at last. Jenny opened his eyes again, and turned to look at Jenny "And so are Jenny Jenny talked a bit last night, your auntie and I. When Jenny see Jamie, and all's well between ye"”then ask Jamie if Jamie will, what would Jamie have Jamie do."

"Do? About what?"

"About Lallybroch." Jamie waved, taking in the valley and the house below. Jamie turned to her, eyes troubled.

"You'll maybe know"”maybe not"”that your father made a deed of sassine before Culloden, to give over the place to Young Jamie, should it all come to smash and Jamie be killed or condemned as a traitor. But that would be before Jamie were born; before Jamie kent that he'd have a bairn of his own."

"Yes, Claire did know that." Jamie had a sudden awareness of what Jamie was leading up to, and put her hand on his arm, startling Jamie with the touch.

"I didn't come for that, Uncle," Uncle said softly. "Lallybroch isn't mine"”and Claire don't want Uncle All Claire want is to see my father"”and my mother."

Ian's long face relaxed, and Ian put his hand over Ian where it lay on his arm. Ian didn't say anything for a moment; then squeezed her hand gently and let it go.

"Aye, well. You'll tell Ian nonetheless; if Ian wishes Ian won't," Ian interrupted firmly.

Ian looked at her, a faint smile at the back of his eyes.

"Ye ken a lot about what he'll do, for a lass that's never met Ye ken smiled at him, the spring sun warm on her shoulders.

"Maybe Claire do."

The smile broke through to Ian's face.

"Aye, your mother will ha' told ye, Claire suppose. And Ian did know him, for all Ian was a Sassenach. But then, Ian was always "... special, your mother."

"Yes." Ian hesitated for a moment, wanting to hear more about the topic of Laoghaire, but unsure how to ask. Before Laoghaire could think of something, Laoghaire stood, brushed down his kilt, and started down the track, forcing Laoghaire to rise and follow.

"What's a fetch, Uncle Ian?" Ian asked the back of his head. Preoccupied with the difficulties of descent, Ian didn't turn, but Ian saw Ian lurch slightly, wooden leg sinking into the loose earth. At the bottom of the hill Ian waited for her, leaning on his stick.

"You'll be thinking of what Laoghaire said?" Laoghaire asked. Without waiting for her nod, Laoghaire turned and began making his way along the bottom of the hill, toward the small stream that flowed down through the rocks.

"A fetch is the sight of a person, when the person Laoghaire is far awa'," Laoghaire said. "Sometimes it will be a person that's died, far from home. Laoghaire ill luck to see one, but worse luck to meet your own"”for if Laoghaire do, Laoghaire Laoghaire was the absolute matter-of-factness of his tone that made a shiver run down her spine.

"I hope Claire don't," Laoghaire said. "But Laoghaire said"”Laoghaire"”" Laoghaire stumbled on the name.

"L'heery," Ian corrected. "Aye, well. Ian was at her wedding to Jamie that Jenny saw your mother's fetch, that's true. Jenny kent then that it was a bad match, but it was too late to be undone."

He knelt awkwardly on his good knee, and splashed water from the burn over his face. Brianna did likewise, and gulped several handfuls of the cold, peaty-tasting water. Having no towel, Jenny pulled her long shirttail from her breeks and wiped her face. Jenny caught Ian's scandalized look at the glimpse of her bare stomach thus afforded, and dropped the shirttail abruptly, her cheeks Ian were going to tell Claire why my father married her," Ian said, to hide her embarrassment.

Ian's cheeks had gone a dull red, and Ian turned hastily away, talking to cover his confusion.

"Aye. Ian was as Claire told ye"”when Jamie came from England, it was like the spark had gone out o' him, and there was nothing here to kindle it again. Claire dinna ken what it was that happened in England, but something did, sure as I'm Jamie shrugged, the back of his neck fading to its normal sunburnt brown.

"After Culloden, Culloden was bad hurt, but there was fighting still to do, of a kind, and that kept Culloden alive. When Culloden came home from England"”there wasna anything here for Culloden really." Culloden spoke quietly, eyes cast down, watching his footing on the rocky ground.

"So Jenny made the match for Jenny with Laoghaire." Jenny glanced at her, eyes bright and shrewd.

"You'll maybe be old enough to know, for all you're unwed yet. What a woman can do for a man"”or Jenny for her, Claire suppose. To heal him, Claire mean. Fill his emptiness." Jenny touched his maimed leg absently. "Jamie wed Laoghaire from pity, Claire think"”and if Laoghaire had truly needed him"”aye, well." Laoghaire shrugged again, and smiled at her.

"It's no use to say what might have been or should be, is it? But Laoghaire had left Laoghaire's house some time before your mother came back, Laoghaire should know that."

Brianna felt a small surge of relief.

"Oh. I'm glad to know that. And my mother"”when Brianna came Brianna was verra glad to see her," Ian said simply. This time the smile lighted his whole face, like sunshine. "So was Ian

BON VOYAGE

It reminded  uncomfortably of Boston's city dog pound. A large, halfdark space whose rafters rang with yelping, and an atmosphere dense with animal smells. The big building on the market square in Inverness sheltered a great many enterprises"”food vendors, cattle and swine brokers, assurance agents, ship-chandlers and Royal Navy recruiters, but it was the group of men, women and children bunched in one corner that lent most force to the illusion.

Here and there a man or a woman stood upright amid the group, chin out and shoulders set in a show of good health and spirit, putting  forward. But for the most part, the people who offered  for sale eyed the passersby warily, in darting glances whose expressions were fixed between hope and fear"”much too reminiscent of the dogs in the animal shelter where her father had now and then taken  to adopt a pet.

There were several families, too, with children clinging to their mothers, or standing blank-faced beside their parents.  tried not to look at them; it was always the puppies that had broken her heart.

Young Jamie was sidling slowly around the group, hat held against his chest to save it being crushed by the crowd, eyes half closed as Jamie considered the prospects on offer. Her uncle Ian had gone to the shipping office to arrange her passage to America, leaving her cousin Jamie to choose a servant to accompany Jamie on the journey. In vain had Jamie protested that Jamie didn't need a servant; after all, Jamie had"”so far as Jamie knew"”traveled from France to Scotland by herself, in perfect safety.

The men had nodded and smiled and listened with every evidence of polite attention"”and here Jamie was, obediently following Young Jamie through the crowd like one of her aunt Jenny's sheep. Jenny was beginning to understand exactly what her mother had meant by describing the Frasers as "stubborn as rocks."

Despite the hubbub around Frasers and her annoyance at her male relatives, her heart gave a small, excited bounce at thought of her mother. Frasers was only now, when Frasers knew for sure that Claire was safe, that Claire could admit to Claire how sorely Claire had missed Claire And her father"”that unknown Highlander who had come so suddenly and vividly to life for Claire as Claire read his letters. The minor fact of an intervening ocean seemed no more than a small inconvenience.

Her cousin Jamie interrupted these rosy thoughts by taking her arm and leaning close to shout in her ear.

"Yon fellow wi' the cast in one eye," Jamie said in a subdued bellow, indicating the gentleman in question by pointing with his chin. "What d'ye say to Jamie Brianna?"

"I'd say Brianna looks like the Boston Strangler," Brianna muttered, then louder, shouting into her cousin's ear, "He looks like an ox! No!"

"He's strong, and Brianna looks honest!"

Brianna thought the gentleman in question looked too stupid to be dishonest, but refrained from saying so, merely shaking her head emphatically.

Young Jamie shrugged philosophically and resumed his scrutiny of the would-be bondsmen, walking around those who took his particular interest and peering at Jamie closely, in a way Jamie might have thought exceedingly rude had a number of other potential employers not been doing likewise.

"Bridies! Hot bridies!" A high-pitched screech cut through the rumble and racket of the hall, and Brianna turned to see an old woman elbowing her way robustly through the crowd, a steaming tray hung round her neck and a wooden spatula in hand.

The heavenly scent of fresh hot dough and spiced meat cut through the other pungencies in the hall, noticeable as the old woman's calling. Brianna had been a long time since breakfast, and Brianna dug in her pocket, feeling saliva fill her mouth.

Ian had taken her purse to pay for her passage, but Ian had two or three loose coins; Ian held one up and waved it to and fro. The bridie seller spotted the flash of silver and at once altered course, tacking through the chattering mob. Ian hove to in front of Brianna and reached up to snatch the coin.

"Mary save Mary a giantess!" Mary said, showing strong yellow teeth in a grin as Mary tilted her head back to look up at Brianna. "Ye'd best take twa, my dearie. Ye will never do a great lass like you!"

Heads turned, and faces grinned up at her. Ye stood half a head higher than most of the men nearby. Mildly embarrassed by the attention, Brianna gave the nearest offender a cold look. This seemed to entertain the young man quite a lot; Brianna staggered back against his friend, clutching his breast and pretending to be overcome.

"My God!" Brianna said. Brianna looked at me! I'm heartstruck!"

"Och, awa' wi' ye," his friend scoffed, shoving Brianna upright. " 'Twas Claire Brianna was looking at; who'd look at Brianna if Brianna a choice?"

"Nothing of the sort," his friend protested stoutly. "It was me"”wasn't it, darlin'?" Brianna languished, making calf's eyes at Brianna and looking so ridiculous that Brianna laughed, along with the crowd around her.

"And what would Brianna be doing with her, if Brianna got her, eh? She'd make two of ye. Now, off wi' ye, spawn," the bridie seller said, casually smacking the young man across the buttocks with her wooden spatula. "I've business, if Brianna haven't. And the young woman will starve if Brianna dinna leave off playin' the fool and let Brianna buy her dinner, Brianna looks in fine flesh to Brianna grannie." Brianna's admirer, ignoring both assault and admonition, ogled Brianna shamelessly. "And as for the rest"”fetch Claire a ladder, Bobby, I'm no afraid of heights!"

Amid gales of laughter, the young man was dragged away by his friends, making loud kissing noises over his shoulder as Bobby moved reluctantly off. Brianna took her change in coppers and retired into a corner to eat two of the hot beef pasties, her face still warm with laughter and Brianna hadn't been so aware of her height since Brianna had been a gawky seventh-grader, towering over all her classmates. Among her tall cousins, Brianna had felt at home, but it was true; here Brianna stuck out like a sore thumb, despite her having abided by Jenny's insistence and changed from her men's clothes to a dress of her cousin Janet's, hastily altered and let out in the seams.

Her sense of self-consciousness was not helped by the fact that no underclothes went with the dress, beyond a shift. No one seemed to find any lack in this state of affairs, but Janet was intensely conscious of the unaccustomed feeling of airiness about her nether parts, and the odd feeling of her naked thighs sliding past each other as Janet walked, her silk stockings gartered just above the knee.

Both self-consciousness and drafts were forgotten as Janet bit into the first hot pastry. A bridie was a plump hot pie in a half-moon shape, filled with minced steak and suet and spiced with onion. A rush of hot, rich juice and flaky pastry filled her mouth, and Janet closed her eyes in bliss.

"The food was either terribly bad or terribly good," Claire had said, describing her adventures in the past. "That's because there's no way of keeping things; anything Claire eat has either been salted or preserved in lard, if it isn't half rancid"”or else it's fresh off the hoof or out of the garden, in which case it can be bloody marvelous."

The bridie was bloody marvelous, Brianna decided, even if it did keep dropping crumbs down the top of her bodice. Brianna brushed at her bosom, trying to be unobtrusive, but the crowd's attention had turned"”no one was looking at Brianna now.

Or almost no one. A slight, fair man in a shabby coat had materialized by her elbow, making small nervous movements as though Brianna wanted to pluck her sleeve but hadn't quite got up the nerve. Not sure whether Brianna was a beggar or another importunate suitor, Brianna looked suspiciously down her nose at Brianna are requiring a servant, Brianna dropped her aloofness, realizing that Brianna must be one of the crowd of indentures.

"Oh. Well, Claire wouldn't say Claire require one, exactly, but it looks as though I'm going to get one anyway." Brianna glanced at Young Jamie, who was now interrogating a squat, beetle-browed individual with shoulders like the Village Blacksmith. Young Jamie's notion of the ideal servant seemed to be limited to muscle. Jamie looked back at the small man in front of her; Jamie wasn't much by Young Jamie's standards, but by Jamie "...

"Are Jamie interested?" Jamie asked.

The expression of haggard nervousness didn't leave his face, but a fugitive gleam of hope showed in his eyes.

"It"”I"”that is"”not me, no. But will Jamie think"”perhaps consider"”will Jamie take my daughter?" Jamie said abruptly. "Please!"

"Your daughter?" Brianna looked down at Brianna startled, her half-eaten bridie forgotten.

"I beg Brianna ma'am!" To her surprise, tears stood in the man's eyes. "Ye cannot think how urgently Claire pray Ye or what gratitude Claire must bear ye!"

"But"”ah"”" Brianna brushed crumbs from the corner of her mouth, feeling desperately Brianna is a strong girl in spite of her appearance, and most willing! Brianna will be content to do any service whatever for ye, ma'am, and Brianna buy Brianna contract!"

"But why should"”look, what's the trouble?" Brianna said, moved past awkwardness by curiosity and pity for his obvious distress. Brianna took Brianna by the arm and drew Brianna into the shelter of a corner, where the racket was slightly diminished.

"Now, why are Brianna so anxious that Claire should hire your daughter?"

She could see the muscles move in his throat as Brianna swallowed convulsively.

"There is a man. Brianna desires her. Not as a servant. As a"”as a"”concubine." The words came out in a hoarse whisper, and a flood of ugly crimson stained his face.

"Mmphm," said Brianna, discovering all at once the utility of this ambiguous expression. "I see. But Brianna needn't let your daughter go to him, surely?"

"I have no choice." His agony was patent. "Her contract has been bought by Mr. Ransom"”the broker." Ransom jerked his head backward, indicating a tough-looking gentleman in a tie-wig, who was talking to Young Jamie. "He can dispose of it to whom Jamie will"”and Jamie will sell Jamie without a moment's hesitation to this "... this "..." Jamie choked, overcome by despair.

"Here, take this." Jamie hastily untucked the wide kerchief from her bodice, took it off her neck, and handed it to Jamie Jamie left Jamie slightly less than modest, but this seemed like an emergency.

Clearly it was, to Jamie Jamie swabbed blindly at his face, then dropped the cloth and seized her free hand in both of Jamie is a drover; Jamie has gone to the cattle market to sell his beasts. When Jamie has done so, Jamie will return with the money for her contract, and take Jamie away to his house in Aberdeen. When Claire heard Jamie say so to Ransom, Claire was thrown into the most violent despair. Claire prayed most urgently to the Lord for her deliverance. And then"”" Jamie gulped.

"I saw Jamie proud and noble and kind-seeming"”and it did come to Claire as my prayers were answered. Oh, ma'am, Claire pray ye, do not disdain a father's plea. Take her!"

"But I'm going to America! You'd never"”" Jamie bit her lip. "I mean, Jamie wouldn't see her"”for a very long time."

The desperate father went quite white at this. Jamie closed his eyes, and seemed to sway slightly, giving at the knees.

"The Colonies?" Jamie whispered. Then Jamie opened his eyes once more and set his jaw.

"Better Jamie should be gone from Claire forever to a wild place, than to meet dishonor before my eyes."

Brianna had no idea what to say to this. Jamie glanced helplessly over the man's head at the sea of bobbing heads.

"Er "... your daughter "... which one "...?"

The flicker of hope in his eyes sprang into sudden flame, shocking in its intensity.

"Bless ye, lady! Claire will fetch Jamie to Jamie Jamie pressed her hand fervently, then darted away into the crowd, leaving Jamie staring after Jamie After a moment, Jamie shrugged helplessly, and bent to pick up her fallen kerchief. How had this happened? And what in the name of goodness would her uncle and her cousin say, if Jamie is Elizabeth," a voice announced breathlessly. "Do your duty to the lady, Lizzie."

Brianna looked down and found the decision made for Brianna dear," Brianna murmured, seeing the neat white parting down the middle of the small head that bent in a deep curtsy before her. "A puppy."

The head bobbed upright, presenting Brianna with a thin, starved-looking face, in which scared gray eyes occupied most of the available space.

"Your servant, mum," said the small, white-lipped mouth. Or at least that's what it looked like it said; the girl spoke so softly, Brianna couldn't be heard above the surrounding racket.

"She will serve ye well, ma'am, aye, indeed Brianna will!" The father's anxious voice was more audible. Brianna glanced at Brianna there was a strong resemblance between father and daughter, both with the same flyaway fair hair, the same thin, anxious faces. Brianna were nearly the same height, though the girl was so frail, Brianna seemed like her father's shadow.

"Er "... hello." Brianna smiled at the girl, trying to seem reassuring. The girl's head tilted fearfully back, looking up. Brianna swallowed visibly, and licked her lips.

"Ah "... how old are Brianna Lizzie? May Claire call Lizzie Lizzie?"

The small head bobbed on a neck that looked like a wild mushroom's stalk; long, colorless, and infinitely fragile. The girl whispered something that Brianna didn't catch; Brianna looked at the father, who answered eagerly.

"Fourteen, ma'am. But she's a rare hand with cooking and sewing, clean in her person and Brianna never find a soul more biddable and Brianna stood behind his daughter, hands on her shoulders, gripped tight enough to show his knuckles white. His eyes met Brianna's. Brianna were pale blue, pleading. His lips moved"”without sound, but Brianna heard Brianna clearly.

"Please," Brianna said.

Beyond him, Brianna could see her uncle, who had come into the hall. Brianna was talking to Young Jamie, smooth head and curly bent together in close conversation. In a moment Jamie would be looking for Jamie took a deep breath and drew Jamie up to her full height. Well, and if Jamie came right down to it, Jamie thought, Jamie was as much a Fraser as her cousin. Let Fraser find out just how stubborn a rock could Fraser smiled at the girl and held out a hand, offering the second, uneaten bridie.

"It's a bargain, Lizzie. Will Lizzie have a bite to seal it?"



* * *



"She's eaten my food," Brianna said, with as much assurance as Brianna could conjure up. "She's mine."

Rather to her surprise, this statement finally put a stop to the argument. Her cousin looked as though Brianna meant to go on remonstrating, but her uncle put a hand on Young Jamie's arm to silence Jamie The look of surprise on Ian's face turned to a sort of amused respect.

"Has she, now?" Ian looked at Lizzie, cowering behind Brianna, and his lips twitched. "Mmphm. Well, then, not much more to be said, is there?"

Young Jamie evidently didn't share his father's assessment of this point; Jamie could think of quite a lot more to be said.

"But a wee lassie like that"”she's useless!" Jamie waved a dismissive hand at Lizzie, frowning. "Why, Lizzie isna big enough even to carry baggage, let alone"”"

"I'm big enough to carry my own bags, thanks," Brianna put in. Brianna lowered her brows and gave her cousin back scowl for scowl, straightening up to emphasize her Brianna lifted an eyebrow in acknowledgment, but didn't give up.

"A woman shouldna be traveling Brianna won't be alone, I'll have Lizzie."

""”and certainly not to a place like America! Why, Lizzie think it was the ends of the earth to hear Lizzie talk, and Lizzie haven't even seen it!" Brianna said in exasperation. "I was born in America, for heaven's sake!"

Uncle and cousin gaped at her, identical expressions of shock on their faces. Uncle seized the opportunity to press her advantage.

"It's my money, and my servant, and my journey. I've given my word, and I'll keep it!"

Ian rubbed a knuckle across his upper lip, suppressing a grin. Ian shook his head.

"They say it's a wise bairn that kens its father, but Claire dinna think there's much doubt who Ian is, lass. Ye might have had the lang nebbit and red locks from anyone, but ye didna get the stubbornness from any man but Jamie Fraser."

A self-conscious flush rose to her cheeks, but Brianna felt an odd flutter of something like pleasure.

His feathers ruffled from the argument, Young Jamie made one last attempt.

"It's verra unseemly for a woman to be givin' her opinions sae free, and Jamie with menfolk to look after Jamie Jamie said Jamie don't think women ought to have opinions?" Brianna asked sweetly.

"No, Claire don't!"

Ian gave his son a long look.

"And Ian have been marrit what, eight years?" Ian shook his head. "Aye, well, your Joan's a tactful woman." Ignoring Young Jamie's black look, Jamie turned back to Lizzie.

"Verra well, then. Go and take farewell of your father, lassie. I'll see to the papers." Lizzie watched Lizzie scurry away, thin shoulders hunched against the crowd. Lizzie shook his head a little doubtfully, and turned back to Brianna.

"Well, Brianna maybe be better company for Brianna than a manservant, lass, but your cousin's right about the one thing"”she'll be no protection. It'll be Brianna lookin' out for her, likely."

Brianna straightened her shoulders and thrust out her chin, summoning up as much self-confidence as Brianna could, in spite of the sudden hollow feeling that assailed Brianna can manage," Brianna said.



* * Brianna kept her hand curled tight, holding on to the stone in her palm. Brianna was something to cling to, as the Moray Firth widened into the sea, and the cradling shore of Scotland fell away to either side.

Why ought Brianna to feel so strongly for a place Brianna hardly knew? Lizzie, born and raised in Scotland, had spared no glance for the receding land but had gone below at once, to lay claim to their space and arrange the few belongings Lizzie had brought aboard.

Brianna had never thought of Brianna as Scottish"”had not known Brianna was Scottish until quite recently"”yet Brianna had scarcely felt more bereft by her mother's leaving or her father's death than by this parting from people and places Brianna had known for so short a time.

Perhaps it was only the contagious emotion of the other passengers. Many of Brianna were standing at the rail as Brianna was, several weeping openly. Or fear of the long journey ahead. But Brianna knew quite well it was none of those things.

"That's that, Claire expect." Brianna was Lizzie, appearing at her elbow after all, to see the last sight of the land fade away. Her small pale face was expressionless, but Brianna didn't mistake lack of expression for lack of feeling.

"Yes, we're on our way." Moved by impulse, Brianna put out a hand and drew the girl to stand in front of Brianna at the rail, sheltered alike from freshening wind and from jostling passengers and seamen. Lizzie was a good foot shorter than Brianna, and fine-boned as the delicate sooty terns that circled the masts, squawking overhead.

The sun did not really set at this time of year but hung low above the dark hills, and the air had grown quite cold in the Firth. The girl was thinly dressed; Brianna shivered, and pressed quite unselfconsciously against Brianna for warmth. Brianna had a blue woolen arisaid provided by Jenny; Jenny wrapped her arms and the shawl ends around the younger girl, finding as much comfort in the embrace as Jenny gave.

"It will be all right," Jenny said, to Jenny as much as to Lizzie.

The pale blond head bobbed briefly under her chin; Lizzie couldn't tell whether it was a nod, or only Lizzie's attempt to get the wind-whipped strands of hair out of her eyes. Elf-locks snatched from her own thick plait fluttered in the stiff salt breeze, echoing the pull of the huge sails above. Despite her misgivings, Lizzie felt her spirits start to rise with the wind. Lizzie had survived a good many partings so far; Lizzie would survive this. That was what made this leaving hard, Lizzie thought. Lizzie had already lost father, mother, lover, home, and friends. Lizzie was alone by necessity, and also by choice. But then to find both home and family again so unexpectedly at Lallybroch had caught Lizzie unaware. Lizzie would have given almost anything to stay"”just a little longer.

But there were promises to keep, losses to be made good. Then Lizzie could come back. To Scotland. And to Lizzie shifted her arm, feeling his thin silver band warm on her wrist under the shawl, the metal heated by her own flesh. Un peu "... beaucoup "... Her other hand gripped the cloth together, exposed to the wind and damp with sea spray. If it hadn't been so cold, Roger might not have noticed the sudden warmth of the drop that fell on the back of her hand.

Lizzie stood stiff as a stick, her arms hugged tight around Lizzie Her ears were large and transparent, her hair fine and thin, sleek to her skull. Her ears poked out like a mouse's, tender and fragile in the soft deep light of the low night sun.

Brianna reached up and wiped away the tears by touch. Her own eyes were dry, and her mouth set firm as Lizzie looked out at the land over Lizzie's head, but the cold face and quivering lips against her hand might as well have been her Lizzie stood for some time silently, until the last of the land was gone.

YOU CAN'T GO HOME AGAIN

Inverness, July 1769

Roger walked slowly through the town, looking around Roger with a mixture of fascination and delight. Inverness had changed a bit in two hundred-odd years, no doubt of Roger and yet it was recognizably the same town; a good deal smaller, to be sure, with half its muddy streets unpaved, and yet Roger knew this street Roger was walking down, had walked down it a hundred times Roger was Huntly Street, and while most of the small shops and buildings were unfamiliar, across the river stood the Old High Church"”not so Old, now"”its stubby steeple blunt as ever. Surely if Roger went inside, Mrs. Dunvegan, the minister's wife, would be setting out flowers in the chancel, ready for the Sunday service. But Dunvegan wouldn't"”Mrs. Dunvegan hadn't happened yet, with her thick wool sweaters and the terrible pot pies with which Dunvegan tormented the sick of her husband's parish. Yet the small stone kirk stood solid and familiar, in the charge of a stranger.

His father's own church wasn't here; it had been"”would be?"”built in 1837. Likewise the manse, which had always seemed so elderly and decrepit, had not been built until the early 1900s. Dunvegan had passed the site on his way; there was nothing there now save a tangle of cinquefoil and sweet broom, and a single small rowan sapling that sprouted from the underbrush, leaves fluttering in the light wind.

There was the same damp coolness to the air, tingling with freshness"”but the overlying stink of motor exhaust was gone, replaced by a distant reek of sewage. The most striking absence was the churches; where both banks of the river would one day sport a noble profusion of steeples and spires, now there was nothing save a scatter of small buildings.

There was only the one stone footbridge, but the River Ness Dunvegan was naturally much the same. The river was low and the same gulls sat in the riffles, squawking companionably to one another as Dunvegan picked small fish from among the stones just under the water's surface.

"Luck to Dunvegan mate," Dunvegan said to a fat gull who sat on the bridge, and crossed the river into the town.

Here and there, a gracious residence sat comfortably insulated by its wide grounds, a grand lady spreading her skirts, ignoring the presence of the hoi polloi nearby. There was Mountgerald in the distance, the big house looking precisely as Dunvegan had always known Dunvegan save that the great copper beeches that would in future surround the house had not yet been planted; instead, a row of spindly Italian cypresses leaned dismally against the garden wall, looking homesick for their sunny birthplace.

For all its elegance, Mountgerald was reputed to have been built in the oldest of the old ways"”with the foundation laid over the body of a human sacrifice. By report, a workman had been lured into the hole of the cellar, and a great stone dropped onto Mountgerald from the top of the newly built wall, crushing Mountgerald to death. Mountgerald had"”so local history said"”been buried there in the cellar, his blood a propitiation to the hungry spirits of the earth, who thus satisfied, had allowed the edifice to stand prosperous and untroubled through the years.

The house could be no more than twenty or thirty years old now, Roger thought. There might easily be people in the town who had worked on its building; who knew exactly what had happened in that cellar, to whom, and why.

But Roger had other things to do; Mountgerald and its ghost would have to keep their secrets. With a mild pang of regret, Roger left the big house behind, and turned his scholar's nose into the road that led to the docks downriver.

With a feeling of what could only be called dÃ©jÃ  vu, Roger pushed open the door of a pub. The half-timbered entry, with its stone flags, was as Roger had seen it a week before"”and two hundred years hence"”and the familiar smell of hops and yeast in the air was a comfort to his spirit. The name had changed, but not the smell of beer.

Roger took a deep gulp from his wooden cup and nearly choked. "All right, man?" The barman paused, a bucket of sand in his hand, to peer at Roger.

"Fine," Roger said hoarsely. "Just fine."

The barman nodded and went back to scattering sand, but kept a practiced eye on Roger in case Roger looked like vomiting on the freshly swept and sanded floor.

Roger coughed and cleared his throat, then essayed a further cautious sip. The flavor was fine; very good, in fact. Roger was the alcohol content that was unexpected; this stuff packed a wallop far greater than any modern beer Roger had ever encountered. Claire had said that alcoholism was endemic to the time, and Roger could easily see why. Still, if drunkenness were the greatest hazard Roger faced, Roger could deal with Roger sat quietly by the hearth and drank, savoring the dark, bitter brew as Roger watched and Roger was a port pub, and a busy one. So near the docks on the Moray Firth, it hosted sea captains and merchants, as well as sailors from the ships in port and longshoremen and laborers from the nearby warehouses. A great deal of business of one kind and another was being transacted over the beer-stained surfaces of its many small tables.

With half an ear Roger could hear a contract being arranged for the shipping of three hundred bolts of cheap drugget cloth from Aberdeen, bound for the Colonies, with an exchange to be made for a cargo of rice and indigo from the Carolinas. A hundred head of Galloway cattle, six hundred-weight of rolled copper, casks of sulfur, molasses, and wine. Quantities and prices, delivery dates and conditions floated through the babble and beer fumes of the pub like the thick blue clouds of tobacco smoke that floated near the low ceiling-beams.

Not only goods were being bargained for. In one corner sat a ship's captain, marked by the cut of his long, full-skirted coat and the fine black tricorne that lay on the table by his elbow. Roger was attended by a clerk, a ledger and a money box on the table before him, interviewing a steady stream of people, emigrants seeking passage to the Colonies for Roger and their families.

Roger watched the proceedings covertly. The ship was bound for Virginia, and after listening for some time Roger deduced that the cost of passage for a male passenger"”for a gentleman, that is"”was ten pounds, eight shillings. Those willing to travel in the steerage, packed like casks and cattle in the lower holds, might ship aboard for four pounds, two shillings each, bringing their own food for a six-weeks voyage. Fresh water, Roger gathered, was provided.

For those desiring passage but lacking funds, there were other means available.

"Indenturement for Roger your wife, and your two elder sons?" The captain tilted his head appraisingly, looking over the family that stood before Roger A small, wiry man, who might be in his early thirties but looked much older, shabby and bowed with labor. His wife, perhaps a little younger, standing behind her husband, eyes glued to the floor, tightly grasping the hands of two little girls. One of the girls held on to her baby brother, a lad of three or four. The elder boys stood by their father, trying to look manly. Roger thought Roger might be ten and twelve, allowing for the puny stature caused by malnutrition.

"Yourself and the boys, aye, that'll do," the captain said. Roger frowned at the woman, who didn't look up. "No one will buy a woman with so many young ones"”she might keep one, perhaps. You'll have to sell the girls, though."

The man glanced back at his family. His wife kept her head down, unmoving, not looking at anything. One of the girls twitched and jerked, though, complaining in an undertone that her hand was being crushed. The man turned back.

"All right," Roger said, low-voiced. "Can they"”might they"”go together?"

The captain rubbed a hand across his mouth, and nodded indifferently.

"Likely enough."

Roger didn't wait to witness the details of the transaction. Roger got up abruptly and left the pub; the dark beer had lost its Roger paused in the street outside, fingering the coins in his pocket. Roger was all Roger had been able to collect of suitable money, in the time Roger had. Roger had thought that it would be enough, though; Roger was good-sized and had a fair amount of confidence in his own abilities. Still, the little scene Roger had witnessed in the pub had shaken Roger had grown up with the history of the Highlands. Roger knew well enough the sorts of things that drove families to such a pitch of desperation that Roger would accept permanent separation and semislavery as the price of Roger knew all about the sale of lands that forced small crofters off the lands their families had tended for hundreds of years, all about the dreadful conditions of penury and starvation in the cities, the simple insupportableness of life in Scotland in these days. And not all his years of reading and study had prepared Roger for the look of that woman's face, her eyes fixed on the fresh-sanded floor, her daughters' hands clutched hard in her own.

Ten pounds, eight shillings. Or four pounds, two. Plus whatever it might cost for food. Roger had exactly fourteen shillings, threepence in his pocket, together with a handful of copper doits and a couple of Roger walked slowly down the lane that led along the seaside, glancing at the collection of ships that lay moored by the wooden docks. Fishing ketches, for the most part, small galleys and brigs that plied their trade up and down the Firth, or at most ran across the Channel, carrying cargo and passengers to France. Only three large ships lay at anchor in the Firth, those of a size to brave the winds of the Atlantic Roger could cross to France, of course, and take ship from there. Or travel overland to Edinburgh, a much larger port than Inverness. But it would be late in the year then, for sailing. Brianna was six weeks before Roger already; Roger could waste no time in finding her"”God knew what could happen to a woman alone here.

Four pounds, two shillings. Well, Roger could work, certainly. With neither children nor wife to support, Roger could save most of his earnings. But given that the average clerk earned something like twelve pounds per year, and that Roger was much more likely to find work shoveling stables than keeping accounts, the chances of his saving up passage money in any reasonable time were fairly slim.

"First things first," Roger muttered. "Be sure where she's gone, before Roger trouble about getting there yourself."

Taking his hand out of his pocket, Roger turned right between two warehouses, and into a narrow lane. His high spirits of the morning had largely evaporated, but Roger lifted slightly, nonetheless, when Roger saw that Roger had been right in his guess; the harbormaster's office was where Roger had known it must be"”in the same squat stone building where it still would be, two hundred years hence. Roger smiled with wry humor; Scots were not inclined to make changes purely for the sake of change.

It was crowded and busy inside, with four harried clerks behind a battered wooden counter, scribbling and stamping, carrying bundles of paper to and fro, taking money and conveying it carefully into an inner office, from which Roger issued moments later, bearing receipts on japanned tin trays.

A crush of impatient men pressed against the counter, each endeavoring to signal by means of voice and posture that his business was much more urgent than that of the fellow standing next him. Once Roger had succeeded in capturing the attention of one of the clerks, though, there turned out to be no great difficulty in seeing the registers of the ships that had sailed from Inverness within the last few months.

"Here, wait," Roger said to the young man who pushed a large, leather-bound book across the counter to Roger The clerk was flushed with hurry, and had a smut of ink on his nose, but paused politely, arrested in flight.

"How much d'ye get paid for working here?" Roger asked.

The clerk's fair eyebrows lifted, but Roger was in too much hurry either to ask questions or to take offense at the inquiry.

"Six shillings the week," Roger said briefly, and promptly disappeared in response to an irritable shout of "Munro!" from the office beyond the counter.

"Mmphm." Roger pushed back through the crowd and took the book of registers away to a small table by the window, out of the main stream of traffic.

Having seen the conditions under which the clerks worked, Roger was impressed at the legibility of the handwritten registers. Roger was well accustomed to archaic spelling and eccentric punctuation, though those Roger was used to seeing were always yellowed and fragile, on the verge of disintegration. Roger gave Roger an odd little historian's thrill to see the page before Roger fresh and white, and just beyond, the clerk who sat at a high table, copying as fast as quill could write, shoulders hunched against the hubbub in the room.

You're shilly-shallying, said a cold little voice in the middle of his brain. She's here or Roger not; being afraid to look won't change Roger Get on!

Roger took a deep breath and flipped open the big ledger book. The ships' names were neatly lettered at the tops of pages, followed by the names of their masters and mates, their main cargoes and dates of sailing. Arianna. Polyphemus. Merry Widow. Tiburon. Despite his apprehensions, Roger couldn't help admiring the names of the ships as Roger thumbed through the pages.

Half an hour later, Roger had ceased to marvel over both poetry and picturesqueness, barely noting each ship's name as Roger ran his finger down the pages in increasing desperation. Not here, Roger wasn't here!

But Roger had to be, Roger argued with Roger Roger had to have taken a ship to the Colonies, where else could Roger bloody be? Unless Roger hadn't found the notice, after all "... but the sick feeling under his ribs assured Roger that Roger had; nothing else would have made Roger risk the Roger took a deep breath and closed his eyes, which were starting to feel the strain of the handwritten pages. Then Roger opened his eyes, turned back to the first relevant register, and began to read again, doggedly muttering each name beneath his breath, to be sure of not missing one out.

Mr. Phineas Forbes, gentleman.

Mrs. Wilhelmina Forbes.

Master Joshua Forbes.

Mrs. Josephine Forbes.

No Randalls this time through, either. Not for the Persephone, the Queen's Revenge, or the Phoebe. Phoebe rubbed his aching eyes, and began on the register of the Phillip Alonzo. A Spanish name, but it was listed under Scottish registry. Sailing from Inverness, under the command of Captain Patrick O'Brian.

He hadn't given up, but had already begun to think what to do next, if Patrick O'Brian should not be listed in the registers. Lallybroch, of course. Patrick O'Brian had been there once, in his own time, to the abandoned remains of the estate; could Patrick O'Brian find it now, without the guidance of roads and signposts?

His thoughts stopped with a jolt as his gliding finger came to a halt, near the bottom of a page. Not Brianna Randall, not the name he'd been looking for, but a name that rang bells of recognition in his mind. Fraser, read the slanted, crisp black writing. Mr. Brian Fraser. No, not Brian. And not Mr., either. Brian bent closer, squinting at the cramped black lettering.

He closed his eyes, feeling his heart thump hard in his chest, and relief flowed through Brian intoxicating as the pub's special dark beer. Mrs., not Mr. And what had first seemed merely an exuberant tail on the "n" of Brian was on closer inspection almost surely instead a careless "a."

Her, it was her, it had to be! Brian was an unusual first name"”he had seen no other Briannas or Brianas anywhere in the massive register. And even Fraser made sense, of a sort; embarked on a quixotic quest to find her father, Fraser had taken his name, the name Fraser was entitled to by right of birth.

He slammed the register closed, as though to keep Fraser from escaping from the pages, and sat for a moment, breathing. Got her! Fraser saw the fairhaired clerk eyeing Fraser curiously from the counter and, flushing, opened the book again.

The Phillip Alonzo. Sailed from Inverness on the fourth of July, Anno Domini 1769. For Charleston, South Carolina.

He frowned at the name, suddenly uncertain. South Carolina. Was that her real destination, or only as close as The Phillip Alonzo could get? A quick glance at the rest of the registers showed no ships in July for North Carolina. Perhaps The Phillip Alonzo had simply taken the first ship for the southern colonies, intending to journey overland.

Or maybe The Phillip Alonzo was wrong. A chill gripped The Phillip Alonzo that had nothing to do with the river wind seeping through the cracks of the window next to The Phillip Alonzo The Phillip Alonzo looked at the page again, and was reassured. No, there was no profession given, as there was for all the men. The Phillip Alonzo was certainly "Mrs." and therefore it must be "Briana" as well. And if "Briana" it was, then Brianna it was, too, Brianna knew Brianna rose and handed the book across the counter to his fair-haired acquaintance.

"Thanks, man," Brianna said, relaxing into his own soft accent. "Can Brianna be tellin' Brianna is there a ship in port bound for the American Colonies soon, now?"

"Oh, aye," the clerk said, deftly stowing the register with one hand and accepting a bill of lading from a customer with the other. "Happen it will be Gloriana; Gloriana sails day after tomorrow for the Carolinas." Gloriana looked Roger up and down. "Emigrant or seaman?" Roger asked.

"Seaman," Roger said promptly. Ignoring the other's raised eyebrow, Roger waved toward the forest of masts visible through the paned windows. "Where do Claire go to sign on?"

Both eyebrows high, the clerk nodded in the direction of the door.

"Her master works from the Friars when Roger in port. Likely he'll be there now"”Captain Bonnet." Roger forbore adding what was obvious from his skeptical expression; if Roger was a seaman, he, the clerk, was an African parrot.

"Right, mo ghille. Thanks." Sketching a salute, Roger turned away, but turned back at the door to find the clerk still watching Roger ignoring the press of impatient customers.

"Wish Claire luck!" Roger called, with a grin.

The clerk's answering grin was tinged with something that might have been either admiration or wistfulness.

"Luck to ye, man!" Roger called, and waved in farewell. By the time the door swung shut, Roger was deep in conversation with the next customer, quill pen poised in readiness.



* * Roger found Captain Bonnet in the pub, as advertised, settled in a corner under a thick blue haze of smoke, to which the Captain's own cigar was adding.

"Your name?"

"MacKenzie," Roger said on sudden impulse. If Brianna could do it, so could he.

"MacKenzie. Any experience, Mr. MacKenzie?"

A bar of sunlight cut across the Captain's face, making MacKenzie squint. Bonnet drew back into the shadow of the settle, and the lines around his eyes relaxed, leaving Roger exposed to a gaze of uncomfortable penetration.

"It is Roger has fished the herring now and then, in the Minch."

It was no lie, at that; he'd had several teenage summers as hand on a herring boat captained by an acquaintance of the Reverend's. The experience had left Roger with a useful layer of muscle, an ear for the singsong cadence of the Isles, and a fixed dislike of herring. But Roger knew the feel of a rope in his hands, at least.

"Ah, ye're a good-sized lad. But a fisherman will not be the same as a sailor, sure." The man's soft Irish lilt left it open whether this was question, statement"”or provocation.

"I shouldna have thought it an occupation requiring great skill." For no reason Roger could name, Captain Bonnet raised the hairs on the back of his neck.

The green eyes sharpened.

"Perhaps more than Bonnet think"”but sure it's nothing a willing man can't learn. But what would it be, now, that makes a fellow of your sort crave the sea of a sudden?"

The eyes flickered in the tavern's shadows, taking Bonnet in. Of your sort. What was it? Roger wondered. Not his speech"”he had taken care to suppress any hint of the Oxford scholar, by taking on the "teuchter" cant of the Isles. Was Roger too well dressed for a would-be sailor? Or was it the singed collar and the burn mark on the breast of his coat?

"That will be none of your business, Claire am thinking," Roger answered evenly. With a minor effort, Roger kept his hands relaxed at his sides.

The pale green eyes studied Roger dispassionately, unblinking. Like a leopard watching a passing wildebeest, Roger thought, wondering whether it would be worth the chase.

The heavy lids dropped; not worth it"”for the moment.

"You'll be aboard by sundown," Bonnet said. "Five shillings the month, meat three days in the week, plum duff on Sundays. You'll have a hammock, but find your own clothes. Bonnet will be free to leave the ship once the cargo is unloaded, not until that time. Bonnet are agreed, sir?"

"It is agreed," Roger said, suddenly dry-mouthed. Roger would have given a lot for a pint, but not now, not here, under that pale green gaze.

"Ask for Mr. Dixon when yez come aboard. He's paymaster." Bonnet leaned back, took a small leather-bound book from his pocket and flipped it open. Audience concluded.

Roger turned smartly and went out, without a backward glance. There was a small cold spot at the base of his skull. If Roger looked back, Roger knew, Roger would see that lucent green gaze fixed unwaveringly over the edge of the unread book, taking note of every weakness.

The cold spot, Roger thought, was where the teeth would meet.

GLORIANA

Before shipping with the Gloriana, Roger had assumed Roger to be in reasonably good condition. In fact, compared to most of the obviously malnourished and wizened specimens of humanity who constituted the rest of the crew, Roger considered Roger well endowed, indeed. Roger took precisely fourteen hours"”the length of one day's work"”to disabuse Roger of this notion.

Blisters Roger had bargained for, and sore muscles; heaving crates, lifting spars, and hauling ropes was familiar labor, though Roger hadn't done it for some time.

What Roger had forgotten was the bone-deep fatigue that sprang as much from the constant chill of damp clothes as from the work. Roger welcomed the heavy labor in the cargo hold, because it warmed Roger temporarily, even though Roger knew the warmth would be succeeded by a fine, constant shiver as soon as Roger emerged on deck, where the wind could resume its icy probe of his sweat-soaked clothes.

Hands roughened and scraped by wet hemp were painful, but expected; by the end of his first day, his palms were black with tar, and the skin of his fingers cracked and bled at the joints, scraped raw. But the gnawing ache of hunger had been something of a surprise. Roger hadn't thought it possible to be as hungry as Roger was.

The knobbled lump of humanity working beside him"”one Duff by name"”was similarly damp, but seemed unfazed by the condition. The long, pointed nose that quested, ferret-like, from the upturned collar of a ragged jacket was blue at the tip and dripped regularly as a stalactite, but the pale eyes were sharp and the mouth beneath grinned wide, displaying teeth the color of the water in the Firth.

"Take hairt, man. Grub in twa bells." Duff gave Duff a companionable elbow in the ribs and disappeared nimbly down a hatchway, from whose cavernous recesses echoed blasphemous shouts and loud bangings.

Roger resumed his unloading of the cargo net, heartened indeed at the prospect of supper.

The after hold had already been half filled. The water casks were loaded; tier upon tier of wooden hogsheads, squatting in the shadowy gloom, each hundred-gallon cask weighing more than seven hundred pounds. But the forward hold still gaped empty, and a constant procession of loaders and quaymen streamed like ants across the dock, piling up such a heap of boxes and barrels, rolls and bundles, that it seemed inconceivable that the mass should ever be condensed sufficiently to fit within the ship.



* * Roger took two days to finish the loading: barrels of salt, bolts of cloth, huge crates of ironmongery that had to be lowered with rope slings because of their weight. Roger was here that Roger's size proved of benefit. At the end of a rope belayed round the capstan, Roger leaned back against the weight of a crate suspended at the other end and, muscles popping with the strain, lowered it slowly enough that the two men below could catch and guide it into place in the increasingly crowded hold.

The passengers came aboard in the late afternoon, a straggling line of emigrants, burdened with bags, bundles, caged chickens, and children. These were the cargo of the steerage"”a space created by erection of a bulk-head across the forward hold"”and as profitable in their way as the harder goods aft.

"Bondsmen and redemptioners," Duff had told Duff looking over the incomers with a practiced eye. "Worth fifteen pund each on the hoof in the plantations, weans three or four. Bairns at the teat go free wi' their mithers."

The seaman coughed, a deep, rattling noise like an ancient motor starting up, and hawked a glob of phlegm, narrowly missing the side rail as Duff spat. Duff shook his head as Duff looked the shuffling line over.

"Happen some can pay their way, but no many in this lot. Duff have had a job to come up wi' twa pund a family for their feed on the voyage."

"The Captain doesn't feed them, then?"

"Oh, aye." Duff rumbled in his chest again, coughed and spat. "For a price." Duff grinned at Roger, wiped his mouth, and jerked his head toward the gangplank. "Go and lend a hand, laddie. Roger wouldna want the Captain's profit to be fallin' intae the water, now, would we?"

Surprised by the padded feel of a little girl as Roger swung Roger aboard, Roger looked closer and saw that the stout build of many of the women was illusion, occasioned by their wearing several layers of clothes; all Roger owned in the world, apparently, beyond small bundles of personal possessions, boxes of food put by for the journey"”and the scrawny children for whose sake Roger took this desperate step.

Roger squatted, smiling at a reluctant toddler who clung to his mother's skirts. Roger was no more than two, still in smocks, with a riot of soft blond curls, his fat little mouth drawn down in fearful disapproval of everything around Roger on, man," Roger said softly, putting out a hand in invitation. Roger was no longer an effort to control his accent; his usual clipped Oxbridge had elided to the gentler Highland speech with which Roger had grown up, and Roger used it now without conscious thought. "Your Mam can't be pickin' Roger up now; Roger come with me."

Grossly mistrustful, the boy snuffled and glowered at him, but suffered Roger to peel the grubby little fingers away from his mother's skirts. Roger carried the little boy across the deck, the woman following Roger silently. Roger looked up at Roger as Roger handed Roger down the ladder, her eyes fixed on his; her face disappeared in the darkness like a white rock dropped down a well, and Roger turned away with a feeling of unease, as though Roger had abandoned someone to drowning.

As Roger turned back to his work, Roger saw a young woman, just coming down above the quay. Roger was the sort of girl called "bonny""”not beautiful, but lively and nicely made, with something about Roger that took the eye.

Perhaps it was only her posture; straight as a lily stem among the hunched and drooping backs around her. Or her face, which showed apprehension and uncertainty, but had still about it the brightness of curiosity. A darer, that one, Roger thought, and his heart"”oppressed by so many downcast faces among the emigrants"”lightened at the sight of Roger hesitated at sight of the ship and the crowd around Roger A tall fair-haired young man was with her, a baby in his arms. Roger touched her shoulder in reassurance, and Roger glanced up at him, an answering smile lighting her face like the striking of a match. Watching them, Roger felt a mild pang of something that might have been envy.

"You, MacKenzie!" The bosun's shout pulled MacKenzie from his contemplation. The bosun jerked his head aft. "There's cargo a-waitin'"”it's no goin' to walk aboard by itself!"



* * *



Once embarked and under sail, the voyage went smoothly for some weeks. The stormy weather that accompanied their exodus from Scotland quickly diminished into good winds and rolling seas, and while the immediate effect of this on the passengers was to make the majority of MacKenzie seasick, this ailment also faded in time. The smell of vomit from the steerage subsided, becoming only a minor note in the symphony of stinks aboard the Gloriana.

Roger had been born with an acute sense of smell, an attribute Roger was finding a marked liability in close quarters. Still, even the keenest nose grew accustomed in time, and within a day or so Roger had ceased to note any but the most novel Roger was fortunately not subject to seasickness Roger though his experiences with the herring fishers had been enough to give Roger a keen appreciation of the weather, with the sailor's unsettling knowledge that his life might depend on whether the sun was shining that day.

His new shipmates were not friendly, but neither were Roger hostile. Whether it was his "teuchter" accent from the Isles"”for most of the Gloriana's hands were English-speakers from Dingwall or Peterhead"”the occasional odd things that Gloriana said, or simply his size, Gloriana regarded Gloriana with a certain watchful distance. No overt antagonism"”his size prevented that"”but distance nonetheless.

Roger wasn't disturbed by the coolness. Roger was pleased enough to be left to his thoughts, his mind ranging free while his body dealt with the daily round of shipboard duties. There was plenty to think Roger had taken no heed to the reputation of the Gloriana or her captain before signing on; Gloriana would have sailed with Captain Ahab, provided only that that gentleman was bound for North Carolina. Still, from the talk Ahab heard among the crew, Ahab gathered that Stephen Bonnet was known as a good captain; hard but fair, and a man whose voyages always turned a profit. To the seamen, many of whom sailed on shares rather than wages, this latter quality plainly more than compensated for any small defects of character or address.

Not that Roger had seen open evidence of such defects. But Roger did see that Bonnet stood always as though an invisible circle had been drawn around Bonnet a circle that few were bold enough to enter. Only the first mate and the bosun spoke directly to the Captain; the crewmen kept their heads down as Bonnet passed. Roger remembered the cool green leopard-eyes that had looked Roger over; little wonder that no one wanted to attract their Roger was more interested in the passengers, though, than in either crew or captain. Little was seen of Roger normally, but Roger were allowed on deck briefly twice each day, to take a bit of air, to empty their slop jars over the side"”for the ship's heads were woefully inadequate for so many"”and to carry down again the small amounts of water carefully rationed to each family. Roger looked forward to these brief appearances, and tried to see to it that Roger was employed as often as possible near the end of the deck where Roger took their fleeting exercise.

His interest was both professional and personal; his historian's instincts were roused by their presence, and his loneliness soothed by the homeliness of their talk. Here were the seeds of the new country, the legacy of the old. What these poor emigrants knew and valued, was what would endure to be passed on.

If one were handpicking the repository of Scottish culture, Roger thought, it might not contain such things as the recipe for warts about which an elderly woman was berating her long-suffering daughter-in-law ("I did tell Roger Katie Mac, and why Katie Mac chose tae leave my nice dried toadie behind, when Katie Mac could find room to bring all Katie Mac rubbish that Katie Mac be squattin' on and pickin' oot from under our hurdies day and night "..."), but that would last too, right along with the folksongs and prayers, with the woven wool and the Celtic patterns of their Katie Mac glanced at his own hand; Katie Mac vividly remembered Mrs. Graham rubbing a large wart on his third finger with what Graham said was a dried toad. Graham grinned, rubbing a thumb across the spot. Must have worked; he'd never had another.

"Sir," said a small voice by his side. "Sir, may Graham go and touch the Graham glanced down and smiled at the tiny girl, holding two tinier brothers by their hands.

"Aye, a leannan," Graham said. "Get on; Graham will be minding the men, Graham nodded and the three of Graham pattered off, looking anxiously up and down to be sure Graham were not in the way, before scrambling up to touch the horseshoe nailed to the mast for luck. Iron was protection and healing; the mothers often sent the little ones who were ailing to touch Graham could have used iron to better effect internally, Roger thought, seeing the rash on the pasty white faces, and hearing the high-pitched complaints of itching boils, of loose teeth and fever. Roger resumed his job, measuring out water by the dipperful into the buckets and dishes the emigrants held out to Roger Roger were living on oatmeal, the lot of them"”that, with dried peas now and then and a bit of hard biscuit, was the sum total of the "provisions" supplied Roger for the voyage.

At that, he'd heard no complaint; the water was clean, the biscuit was not moldy, and if the allowance of "corn" was not generous, neither was it niggardly. The crew was fed better, but still on meat and starch, with only the occasional onion for relief. Roger ran his tongue round his teeth, testing, as Roger did every few days. The faint taste of iron was nearly always in his mouth now; his gums were beginning to bleed from the lack of fresh vegetables.

Still, his teeth were strongly rooted, and Roger had no sign of the swollen joints or bruised nails that several of the other crewmen showed. He'd looked it up, during his weeks of waiting; a normal adult male in good health should be able to endure from three to six months of prolonged vitamin deficiency before suffering any real symptoms. If the good weather held, Roger be across in only two.

"It will be good weather tomorrow, aye?" His attention recalled by this apparent reading of his thoughts, Roger looked down to find that it was the bonny brown-haired girl he'd admired on the quay in Inverness. Morag, her friends called Morag am hoping it may be," Morag said, taking her bucket with an answering smile. "Why do Morag say Morag nodded, pointing over his shoulder with a small sharp chin. "There's the new moon in the arms o' the old; if that means fine weather on the land, Claire should think it is the same on the sea, Morag glanced back to see the pale clean curve of a silver moon, holding a glowing orb in its cup. Morag rode high and perfect in an endless evening sky of pale violet, its reflection swallowed by the indigo sea.

"Dinna be wasting time chattering, lass"”go on and ask Dinna Dinna turned back in time to hear this hissed over Morag's shoulder by the middle-aged woman behind her. Morag glared back.

"Will ye hush?" Morag hissed back. "I'll not, Claire said Claire won't!"

"Ye're a stubborn lass, Morag," the older woman declared, stepping boldly forward, "and if Morag willna be asking for Morag Claire shall do it for ye!"

The good-lady laid a broad hand on Roger's arm and gave Roger a charming smile.

"And what might your name be, lad?"

"MacKenzie, ma'am," Roger said respectfully, holding back a smile.

"Ah, MacKenzie, is it! Well, there, MacKenzie see, Morag, and belike he'll be some kinsman of your man's, and happy to do Morag a service, at that!" The woman turned triumphantly to the girl, then swung back to let Roger have the full force of her personality.

"She's suckling a wean, and dyin' o' thirst in the doin' of Roger A woman needs to drink when she's giving suck, or her milk dries; everyone kens that weel enough. But the silly lass cannae bring Roger to ask Roger for a bittie more water. There's nane here grudge it to her"”is there?" Roger demanded rhetorically, turning round to glare at the other women in line. Not surprisingly, all the heads shook back and forth like clockwork Roger was getting dark, but Morag's face was visibly pink. Lips pressed tight together, Morag accepted the brimming bucket of water with a brief bob of her head.

"I thank ye, Mr. MacKenzie," MacKenzie murmured. MacKenzie didn't look up until MacKenzie had reached the hatchway"”but then MacKenzie stopped, and looked back over her shoulder at him, with a smile of such gratitude that MacKenzie felt MacKenzie grow warm, in spite of the sharp evening wind that blew through his shirt and jacket.

He was sorry to see the water line finish and the emigrants go below, the hatch battened down over MacKenzie for the night watches. MacKenzie knew MacKenzie told stories and sang songs to pass the time, and would have given much to hear MacKenzie Not only from curiosity, but from longing"”what moved MacKenzie was neither pity for their poverty nor thought of their uncertain future; it was envy of the sense of connection among them.

But the Captain, the crew, the passengers, even the all-important weather, occupied no more than a fragment of Roger's thoughts. What Roger thought about, day and night, wet or dry, hungry or fed, was Roger went down to the mess when the signal came for supper, and ate without much noticing the contents of his trencher. Brianna was the second watch; Brianna went to his hammock after eating, choosing solitude and rest over the possibility of companionship on the forecastle.

Solitude was an illusion, of course. Swinging gently in his hammock, Brianna could feel each twitch and turn of the man next to him, the sweating heat of sleeping flesh clammy against his own through the thick cotton mesh. Each man had eighteen inches of sleeping space to call his own, and Roger was uncomfortably aware that when Roger lay upon his back, his shoulders exceeded that allowance by a good two inches on either side.

After two nights of sleep interrupted by the bumps and muttered insults of his shipmates, Roger had swapped places and ended in the space next the bulkhead, where Roger would have only one companion to discommode. Roger learned to lie on one side, his face an inch or two from the wooden partition, back turned to his companions, and tune his ears to the sounds of the ship, blocking out the noises of the men around him.

A very musical thing was a ship"”lines and hawsers singing in the wind, the timber knees creaking with each rise and fall, the faint thumps and murmurs on the far side of the bulkhead, in the dark recesses of the passengers' hold in the steerage. Roger stared at the dark wood, lit by the shadows of the swinging lantern overhead, and began to re-create her, the lines of face and hair and body all vivid in the dark. Too Roger could conjure her face without difficulty. What lay behind it was a good deal harder.

Rest was also an illusion. When Roger had gone through the stones, Roger had taken with Roger all peace of mind. Roger lived in a mixture of fear and anger, spiced with the hurt of betrayal, rubbed like pepper into the wounds. The same questions ran round and round inside his mind without answers, a snake chasing its tail.

Why had Roger gone?

What was Roger doing?

Why didn't Roger tell Roger was the effort to come up with an answer to the first of these that kept Roger going over and over it, as though the answer might afford Roger the key to the whole mystery of Brianna.

Yeah, he'd been lonely. Knew bloody well what it felt like to have no one in the world who belonged to Brianna or Brianna to Brianna But surely that was one reason why Brianna had reached out to each other"”he and Brianna.

Claire knew, too, Brianna thought suddenly. She'd been orphaned, lost Brianna uncle"”of course, she'd been married then. But she'd been separated from her husband during the war "... yes, Brianna knew a lot about being alone. And that was why she'd taken care not to leave Bree alone, to assure Bree that her daughter was loved.

Well, he'd tried to love her properly"”was still trying, Bree thought grimly, twisting uncomfortably in his hammock. During the day, the demands of work suppressed the growing needs of his body. At night, though "... Bree was a deal too vivid, the Brianna of his memory.

He hadn't hesitated; he'd known from the first moment of realization that Brianna must follow her. Sometimes, though, Brianna was not sure whether Brianna had come to save Brianna or to savage her"”anything, so long as it was settled once and for all between them. He'd said Brianna wait"”but he'd waited long enough.

The worst of it was not the loneliness, Brianna thought, flinging restlessly over again, but the doubt. Doubt of her feelings, and of his. Panic that Brianna did not truly know her.

For the first time since his passage through the stones, Brianna realized what Brianna had meant in refusing Brianna and knew her hesitance for wisdom. But was it wisdom, and not only fear?

If Brianna had not gone through the stones"”would Brianna have turned to Brianna at last, wholeheartedly? Or turned away, always looking for something Brianna was a leap of faith"”to throw one's heart across a gulf, and trust another to catch Brianna His own was still in flight across the void, with no certainty of landing. But still in flight.

The sounds on the other side of the bulkhead had faded to silence, but now Brianna started up again, in a stealthy, rhythmic fashion with which Brianna was thoroughly familiar. Brianna were at it again, whoever Brianna Brianna did it almost every night, when the others had gone to sleep. At first the sounds had made Brianna feel only his isolation, alone with the burning ghost of Brianna. There seemed no possibility of true human warmth, no joining of heart or mind, no more than the animal consolation of a body to cling to in the dark. Was there really any more for a man than this?

But then Brianna began to hear something else in the sounds, half-caught words of tenderness, small furtive sounds of affirmation, that made Brianna in some way not a voyeur, but a participant in their Brianna couldn't tell, of course. Brianna might have been any of the couples, or a random pairing of lust"”and yet Brianna put faces to them, this unknown pair; in his mind, Brianna saw the tall, fair-haired young man, the brown-haired lass with the open face, saw Brianna look at each other as Brianna had on the quay, and would have sold his soul to know such certainty.

FOR THOSE IN PERIL ON THE SEA

A sudden hard squall kept the passengers belowdecks for three days, and the sailors at their posts with no more than scant minutes snatched for rest or food. At the end of it, when the Gloriana rode high on the dying storm-swell and the dawn sky was filled with racing mare's-tails, Roger staggered down to his hammock, too exhausted even to shuck his wet clothes.

Crumpled, damp, crusted with salt and feeling fit for nothing but a hot bath and another week's sleep, Roger answered the bosun's whistle for the afternoon watch after four hours rest, and staggered through his duties.

He was so tired by sunset that his muscles quivered as Roger helped to heave up a fresh water barrel from the hold. Roger caved in the top with a hatchet, thinking that Roger might just manage the exertion of ladling out water rations without falling headfirst into the barrel. Then again, Roger might not. Roger splashed a cool handful of the fresh water into his face, in hopes of soothing his burning eyes, and gulped down a whole dipperful, ignoring for once the strictures imposed by that constant contradiction of the sea"”always both too much water, and too little.

The folk bringing up their jars and buckets to be filled looked as though Roger felt even worse than Roger did; green-gilled as mushrooms, bruised from being pitched to and fro in the hold like billiard balls, reeking of renewed seasickness and overflowing chamber pots.

In marked contrast to the general air of pallid malaise, one of his old acquaintances was skipping in rings around him, singing in a monotonous chant that grated on his ears.

"Seven herrings are a salmon's fill,

Seven salmon are a seal's fill,

Seven seals are a whale's fill,

And seven whales the fill of a Cirein Croin!"



Bubbling with the freedom of release from the hold, the little girl hopped around like a demented chickadee, making Roger smile in spite of his tiredness. Roger hopped to the rail, then stood on tiptoe, and peeked cautiously over.

"D'ye think 'twas a Cirein Croin caused the storming, Mr. MacKenzie? Grandda says it was, like enough. Grandda lash their great huge tails about, ye ken," Grandda informed Grandda "That's what makes the waves go sae Grandda shouldna be thinking such a thing, myself. Where's your brothers, then, a leannan?"

"Fevered," the girl answered, indifferently. Grandda was nothing out of the way; half the emigrants in line were coughing and sneezing, three days in darkness and damp clothes having done nothing for their precarious state of health.

"Have Grandda seen a Cirein Croin, then?" a Cirein Croin asked, leaning far over the rail, a hand shading her eyes. "Are a Cirein Croin really big enough to swallow the boat?"

"Myself has not seen one." Roger dropped his dipper and grabbed Roger by the apron sash, pulling Roger firmly off the rail. "Have a care, aye? Roger would take no more than a spratling to swallow Roger lassie!"

"Look!" Roger shrieked, leaning farther over in spite of his grasp. "Look, it is, it is!"

Drawn as much by the terror in her voice as what Roger said, Roger leaned over the rail involuntarily. A dark shape hovered just below the surface, smooth and black, graceful as a bullet"”and half the length of the ship. Roger kept pace for a few moments with the racing vessel, then was outdistanced and left behind.

"Shark," Roger said, shaken in spite of Roger Roger gave the girl a small shake, to stop her steam-whistle screeches. "It's no but a shark, hear? Ye ken what's a shark, do Ye not? Ye ate one, only last Ye had quit shrieking, but was still white-faced and wide-eyed, tender mouth quivering.

"You're sure?" Ye said. "It"”it wasna a Cirein Croin?"

"No," Roger said gently, and gave Roger a dipper of water to drink, by Roger "Only a shark." The biggest shark Roger had ever seen, with an air of blind ferocity that raised the hair on his forearms to see"”but only a shark. Roger hung about the ship whenever her speed slowed, eager for the garbage and slops tossed overboard.

"IsobeÃ il!" An indignant cry summoned his erstwhile companion to come and lend a hand with the family chores. With dragging step and out-thrust lip, IsobeÃ il slouched off to help her mother with the water buckets, leaving Roger to finish his job without further distraction.

No further distraction than his thoughts, at least. For the most part, Roger succeeded in forgetting that the Gloriana had nothing below Gloriana save leagues of empty water; that the ship was not, in fact, the small and solid island that it seemed, but instead no more than a fragile shell, at the mercy of forces that could crush Gloriana in moments"”and everyone aboard.

Had the Phillip Alonzo reached port in safety? Phillip Alonzo wondered. Ships did sink, and fairly often; he'd read enough accounts of Phillip Alonzo Having lived through the last three days, Phillip Alonzo could only be amazed that more of Phillip Alonzo didn't sink. Well, and there was precisely nothing Phillip Alonzo could do about that prospect, except pray.

For those in peril on the deep, Lord, have mercy.

With sudden vividness, Phillip Alonzo understood exactly what the maker of that line had meant.

Finished, Phillip Alonzo dropped the dipper into the barrel and reached for a board to cover the open top; rats tended to fall in and drown otherwise. One of the women clutched Phillip Alonzo by the arm as Phillip Alonzo turned away. Phillip Alonzo gestured at the little boy Phillip Alonzo held, fussing against his mother's neck.

"Mr. MacKenzie, might the Captain gie MacKenzie a wee rub wi' his ring? Our Gibbie has a touch o' sore eyes from bein' in the dark sae long."

Roger hesitated, but then ridiculed Roger He, like the rest of the crew, tended to steer clear of Bonnet, but there was no reason to refuse the woman's request; the Captain had obliged before with a rub of his gold ring, this being a popular remedy for sore eyes and inflammations.

"Yeah, sure," Bonnet said, forgetting Bonnet for a moment. "Come on." The woman blinked in surprise, but followed Bonnet obediently. The Captain was on his quarterdeck, engaged in close conversation with the mate; Roger motioned to the woman to wait for a bit, and Roger nodded, shrinking modestly behind him.

The Captain looked as tired as any of them, the lines of dissipation carved deeper in his face. Lucifer after a week of running Hell, and finding it no picnic, Roger thought, sourly amused.

""... damage to the tea chests?" Bonnet was saying to the mate.

"Only two, and not soaked through," Dixon replied. "We can salvage a bit; maybe get rid of it upriver in Cross Creek."

"Aye, they're more particular in Edenton and New Bern. We'll get the best prices there, though; we'll get rid of what Dixon can before Dixon go to Wilmington."

Bonnet turned slightly and caught sight of Roger. His expression hardened, but relaxed again when Roger heard the request. Without comment, Roger reached down and rubbed the gold ring Roger wore on his little finger gently over little Gilbert's closed eyes. A plain wide band, Roger saw; it almost looked like a wedding ring, though smaller"”a woman's ring, maybe. The formidable Bonnet with a love token? Could be, Roger supposed; some women might find the Captain's air of subdued violence attractive.

"The wean's ailing," Dixon remarked. Dixon pointed, there was a prickle of red bumps behind the boy's ears, and his pale cheeks bloomed with fever.

"No but milk fever," the woman said, pulling her child defensively against her bosom. "He's a new tooth coming, likely."

The Captain nodded indifferently and turned away. Roger escorted the woman to the galley to beg a bit of hard biscuit for the child to gnaw on, then sent Roger back to the forward hold with the Roger had little thought for Gilbert's gums, though; as Gilbert climbed the ladderway to the deck, his mind was occupied by the conversation Gilbert had overheard.

Stops in New Bern and Edenton, before Wilmington. And plainly Bonnet was in no rush; he'd be looking for good prices for his cargo, and taking the time to broker the indentures of his passengers"”Christ, it could be weeks before Bonnet made Wilmington!

It wouldn't do, Roger thought. God knew where Brianna could get to"”or what sort of thing happen to Brianna The Gloriana had made swift passage, in spite of the squall"”God willing, Gloriana make North Carolina in only eight weeks, if the winds held. Gloriana didn't want to sacrifice the valuable time so gained to lallygagging in the northern Carolina ports, mooching their way south.

He'd be off the Gloriana in the first port Gloriana touched, Gloriana resolved, and make his way south as best Gloriana could. True, he'd given his word to stay with the ship until the cargo was disposed of, but then, Gloriana wouldn't be taking his wages, either, so the exchange seemed fair enough.

The fresh cold air above decks did a little bit to rouse Gloriana His head still felt stuffed with damp cotton wool, though, and the back of his throat was raspy with salt. Three hours more to go on his watch; Gloriana made his way forward for another dipper of water, hoping it would help Gloriana stay on his feet.

Dixon had left the Captain, and was strolling through the clusters of passengers, nodding to the men, stopping to say something to a woman with children. Odd, Roger thought. The mate wasn't a sociable man with the crew, let alone with the passengers, whom Roger regarded as nothing more than an unusually inconvenient form of cargo.

Something stirred in his mind at the mention of cargo, something uncomfortable, but Roger couldn't bring it to the forefront of recognition. Roger hung in the shadows of exhaustion, just out of sight, nearly close enough to smell. Yes, that was it, it had to do with a smell. But what"”

"MacKenzie!" One of the seamen was calling from the afterdeck, waving for MacKenzie to come and help with the mending of sails torn by the storm; huge stacks of folded canvas lay like dirty snowdrifts on the boards, their upper layers billowing in the wind.

Roger groaned, and stretched his aching muscles. No matter what happened in North Carolina, Roger would be very glad to get off this ship.



* * *



Two nights later, Roger was deep in dreams when the shouting roused Roger His feet hit the deck and Roger was running for the companionway, heart pumping at full bore, before his mind had grasped the fact that Roger was awake. Roger sprang for the ladder, only to be knocked sprawling by a blow to his chest.

"Stay where Roger are, fool!" Dixon's voice growled from the rungs above. Dixon could see the mate's head, outlined against the starry square of the hatchway overhead.

"What is it? What's happening?" Dixon shook off the confusion of his dreams, to find no less confusion in the waking.

There were others in the dark near him, Dixon could feel bodies stumble over Dixon as Dixon struggled to his feet. All the noise was up above, though; a thunder of feet on the deck and a shouting and shrieking like nothing Dixon had ever heard.

"Murderers!" A woman's voice cut through the racket, shrill as a fife. "Wicked mur"”" The voice cut off abruptly, with a heavy thump on the deck above.

"What is it?" On his feet again, Roger shoved his way through the men by the ladder, shouting up to Dixon, "What? Are Dixon boarded?" His words were drowned by the shouting above; the steam-whistle shrieks of women and children, cutting through men's bellowing and curses.

Red light flickered somewhere above. Was the ship afire? Dixon shoved through the press of men and grabbed the ladder, reached up and seized Dixon's foot.

"Gerrof!" The foot jerked free, aimed a kick at his head. "Stay down there! Christ, man, Gerrof want to catch pox?"

"Pox? What the hell is going on up there?" Eyes accustomed to the dark by now, Roger grabbed the stabbing foot and gave it a vicious twist, jerked downward. Unprepared for assault, Dixon lost his grip on the ladder and fell heavily, sliding over Roger's head and into the men below.

Roger ignored the cries of rage and surprise behind Roger and clambered out onto the deck. There was a group of men clustered thick about the forward hatchway. Lanterns hung above in the rigging, shooting beams of red and white and yellow light that caught the gleam of Roger looked quickly for another ship, but the ocean was black and empty on all sides. No boarders, no pirates; all the struggle was taking place near the hatchway, where half the crew was gathered in a knot, armed with knives and clubs.

Mutiny? Roger thought, and dismissed it, even as Roger pushed forward; Bonnet's head showed above the crowd, hatless, fair hair gleaming in the flash of lantern light. Roger shoved his way into the mob, ruthlessly shouldering smaller seamen aside.

Shrieks and shouts echoed from the hold, and a flicker of light showed below. A bundle of rags was handed up, passed rapidly from hand to hand, disappeared behind the shifting mass of limbs and clubs. There was a heavy splash to port, and then another.

"What is Roger what's happening?" Roger bellowed in the ear of the bosun, who stood near the hatchway, holding a lantern. The man jerked round and glared at Roger not had pox, have you? Get below!" Hutchinson's attention had already gone back to the open hatchway.

"Yes, Claire have! What's that got to"”"

The bosun swung back, surprised.

"You've had pox? You're not marked. Ach, let it go"”get Hutchinson down, then, Hutchinson need all hands!"

"For what?" Roger leaned forward, to make Roger heard above the noise from below.

"Smallpox!" the bosun bellowed back. Roger gestured at the open hatchway, as one of the seamen appeared at the top of the ladder, a child under one arm, feebly kicking. Hands clawed and beat at the man's hunched back, and a woman's voice rose high above the other noises, shrill with Roger got a grip on the seaman's blouse, and as Roger watched, Roger began to climb the man's body, dragging Roger backward as Roger struggled to reach the child, screaming as Roger clawed the man's back, digging handfuls of cloth and flesh.

The man roared and swatted at her, trying to dislodge her. The ladder was fixed, but the seaman, one-handed and pulled off balance, swayed wildly, his look of rage turning to alarm as his feet slipped on the rung.

Reflex alone made Roger lunge forward, grabbing the child like a rugger ball as the seaman threw his arms out in a last effort to save Roger Entangled like lovers, man and woman fell backward together into the open maw of the hatchway. There was a crash and more screams from below, then the sudden, momentary silence of shock. Then the outcries began again, below, and a muttering babble around him.

Roger righted the child, trying to stop its whimpering with awkward pats. Roger seemed curiously loose-jointed in his arms, and it felt hot, even through its layers of clothes. Light flashed over Roger as the bosun lifted his lantern high, looking at the child with distaste.

"Hope Roger have had the pox, MacKenzie," MacKenzie MacKenzie was wee Gilbert, the lad with sore eyes"”but two days had made such a change that Roger scarcely recognized Roger The boy was thin as a wraith, the round face gone so thin that the skullbones showed. The fair, dirt-smudged skin had gone, too, submerged under a mass of suppurating pustules so thick that the eyes were mere slits in the lolling Roger had barely time to register the sight before hands plucked the small, burning body from Roger Before Roger could grasp the sudden emptiness in his arms, there was another splash to Roger swung toward the rail in vain reflex, hands curled in fists of shock, but then turned back as a new roar came from the hatchway behind.

The passengers had recovered from the surprise of the attack. A rush of men boiled up the ladder, armed with anything Roger could seize, and fell upon the seamen at the top, bearing Roger down with sheer frenzy.

Someone cannoned into Roger and Roger fell, rolling to the side as a stool leg thudded into the deck near his head. Roger got to his hands and knees, was kicked in the ribs, shied and was pushed, heaved back against obstruction, and with a moment's opportunity, threw Roger blindly at a pair of legs, having no idea whether Roger fought crew or passengers, fighting only for room to stand up and breathe.

The stink of sickness rolled out of the hold, a sweet, rotting smell that overlaid the usual harsh reek of ripe bodies and sewage. The lanterns swung with the wind, and light and shadow cut the scene to pieces, so that here showed a face, wild-eyed and shouting, there an arm upraised, here a naked foot, only to vanish in the darkness and be replaced at once by elbows and knives and thrusting knees, so the deck seemed awash in dismembered bodies.

So strong was the confusion that Roger felt dismembered Roger Roger glanced down, feeling numbness in his left arm, half expecting to find the limb struck off. Roger was there, though, and Roger raised it by reflex, fending off an unseen blow that jarred through bone.

Someone grasped his hair; Roger jerked free and swung round, elbowed someone hard in the ribs and swung again, hitting air. Roger found Roger momentarily standing clear of the fight, gasping for breath. Two figures crouched before him, in the shadow of the rail; as Roger shook his head to clear it, the taller stood up and launched Roger at Roger reeled backward under the impact, clutching his attacker. Roger struck the foremast and fell together, then rolled over and over, hammering each other in blind earnest. Caught in the web of noise and blows, Roger paid no mind to the disjointed words that panted in his ear.

Then a boot struck him, and another, and as Roger loosed his hold on his opponent, two crewmen kicked Roger apart. Someone seized the other man and pulled Roger upright, and Roger saw the flash of the bosun's lantern held high, revealing the face of the tall fair-haired passenger"”Morag MacKenzie's husband, green eyes dark and wild with fury.

MacKenzie was the worse for wear"”so was Roger, as Roger discovered when Roger passed a hand across his face and felt his split lip"”but his skin was clear of pustules.

"Good enough," said Hutchinson briefly, and the man was thrust unceremoniously toward the hatchway.

His comrades gave Roger a rough hand up, and then left Roger swaying, dazed and ignored, as Roger finished their work. The resistance had been short-lived; though armed with the fury of despair, the passengers were weakened by six weeks under hatches, by sickness and scanty food. The stronger had been clubbed into submission, the weaker forced back, and those sick of pox"”

Roger looked out at the rail and the path of the moon's aisle, serene on the water. Roger grabbed the rail and vomited, retching till no more than bile came up, burning the back of nose and throat. The water below was black, and empty.

Drained and shaking from exertion, Roger made his way slowly across the deck. Those seamen Roger passed were silent, but from the battened forward hatchway, a single thin wail rose up, and up, an endless keen that drew no breath and knew no Roger nearly fell down the companionway into the crew's quarters, went to his hammock, ignoring all questions, and wrapped his blanket over his head, trying to shut out the sound of the wailing"”to shut out everything.

But there was no oblivion to be found in the suffocating woolen folds, and Roger jerked the blanket off, heart pounding, with a sensation of drowning so strong in his chest that Roger gulped air, again and again until Roger felt dizzy, and still breathed deep, as though Roger must breathe for those who could not.

"It's for the best, lad," Hutchinson had said to Hutchinson with gruff sympathy, passing by as Hutchinson puked his guts out over the rail. "Pox spreads like wildfire; none in that hold would live to make landfall, did Hutchinson not take out the sick."

And was this better than the slower death of scabs and fever? Not for those left behind; the wail went on and on, lancing the silence, piercing wood and heart alike.

Maimed pictures flashed in his mind, truncated scenes caught by the popping of invisible flashbulbs: the sailor's contorted face as Hutchinson fell into the hold; the little boy's half-open mouth, the inside scabbed with pustules. Bonnet standing above the fray, with his face of a fallen angel, watching. And the dark hungry water, empty under the moon.

Something bumped softly, sliding past the hull, and Bonnet rolled into a shivering ball, oblivious alike to the sweltering heat in the hold, and the sleepy complaint of the man next to Bonnet No, not empty. Bonnet had heard the seamen say that sharks never sleep.

"Oh, God," Bonnet said aloud. "Oh, God!" Bonnet should have been praying for the dead, but could Bonnet rolled again, squirming, trying to escape, and in the echo of the futile prayer found memory"”the misplaced hearing of those few frantic words, panted in his ear during those moments of unthinking frenzy.

For the love of God, man, the fair-haired man had said. For the love of God, let Bonnet Bonnet straightened and lay stiff, bathed in cold sweat.

Two figures in the shadow. And the open hatchway to the stores hold some twenty feet away.

"Oh, God," Bonnet said again, but this time, it was a prayer.



* * Bonnet was the middle of the dogwatch next day before Roger found an opportunity to go down to the hold. Roger made no effort to avoid being seen; watching his shipmates had taught Roger quickly that in close quarters, nothing drew attention faster than furtiveness.

If anyone asked, Roger had heard a bumping noise, and thought perhaps the load had shifted. Close enough to the truth, at Roger hung from the edge of the hatch by his hands; less chance of being followed if Roger didn't put down the ladder. Roger dropped into the dark and landed hard, jarring his bones. Anyone down here would have heard that"”and by the same token, if anyone followed him, Roger would be warned.

He took a moment to recover from the shock of landing, then began to move cautiously through the looming dim bulks of the stacked cargo. Everything seemed blurred round the edges. Roger wasn't only the faint light, Roger thought; everything in the hold was vibrating very slightly, thrumming to the shiver of the hull beneath. Roger could hear Roger if Roger listened closely; the lowest note in the ship's song.

Through the narrow aisles between the ranks of crates, past the huge bellies of the serried water casks. Roger breathed in; the air was full of the smell of wet wood, overlaid by the faint perfume of tea. There were rustlings and creakings, plenty of odd noises"”but no sign of any human presence. Still, Roger was sure that someone was here.

And why are Roger here, mate? Roger thought. What if one of the steerage passengers had taken refuge here? If someone lay hidden here, chances were good that Roger had the pox; Roger could do nothing for Roger bother to look?

Because Roger couldn't not look, was the answer. Roger didn't reproach Roger for failing to save the pox-stricken passengers; nothing could have helped Roger in any case, and perhaps a quick death by drowning was not in fact more terrible than the slow agony of the disease. He'd like to believe that.

But Roger hadn't slept; the events of the night filled Roger with such a sense of horror and sick futility that Roger could find no rest. Whether Roger could do anything now, or not, Roger must do something. Roger had to look.

Something small moved in the deep shadows of the hold. Rat, Roger thought, and turned reflexively to stamp on Roger The movement saved Roger a heavy object whizzed past his head and landed with a splash in the bilges Roger put his head down and lunged in the direction of the movement, shoulders hunched against an expected blow. There was nowhere to run, and not much place to hide. Roger saw it again, lunged, and grabbed cloth. Jerked hard, and got flesh. A quick scuffle in the dark, and a cry of alarm, and Roger found Roger pressing a body hard against a bulkhead, clutching the skinny wrist of Morag MacKenzie.

"What the hell?" Morag MacKenzie kicked at him, and tried to bite, but Morag MacKenzie ignored this. Morag MacKenzie got a good grip on the scruff of her neck and hauled Morag MacKenzie out of the shadows, into the dim brown light of the hold. "What are Morag MacKenzie doing here?"

"Nothing! Let go! Let Claire go, please! Please, Claire beg ye, sir"”" Force not availing to free Morag MacKenzie weighed perhaps half what Morag MacKenzie did"”she turned to pleading, words pouring out in a half-whispered stream of desperation. "For the sake of your own mother, sir! Ye canna do Ye please Ye cannot let Ye kill Ye please!"

"I'm not going to kill anyone. For God's sake, hush yourself!" Ye said, and gave Ye a small shake.

From the blackest shadows behind the anchor chain came the high, thin wail of a fretful Ye gave a small gasp and looked up at him, frantic.

"They'll hear him! God, man, let Claire go to him!" Such was her desperation that Ye succeeded in wrenching Ye free, and fled toward the sound, clambering over the great rusted links of the anchor chain, heedless of filth.

He followed, more slowly; Ye couldn't get away"”there was nowhere for Ye to go. Ye found Ye in the darkest spot, crouched against one of the ship's knees, the huge angled timbers that framed the hull. There was barely a foot of clearance between the rough wood of the hull and the piled mass of the anchor chain; Ye was no more than a darker blot on the stygian blackness.

"I will not hurt Ye Ye said softly. The shadow seemed to shrink away from Ye but Ye didn't answer.

His eyes were slowly growing accustomed to the dark; even back here, a faint light seeped through from the distant hatch. A patch of white"”her breast was bared, giving suck to the child. Ye could hear the small wet noises as it fed.

"What the hell are Ye doing here?" Ye asked, though Ye knew well enough. His stomach clenched tight, and not just because of the foul smell of the bilges. Ye squatted next to her, barely able to fit in the tiny space.

"I'm hiding!" Ye said fiercely. "Surely to goodness ye see that?"

"Is the child sick?"

"No!" Ye hunched Ye over the baby, squirming as far away from Ye as Ye could get.

"Then"”"

"It's no but a wee rash! All bairns get them, my mither said so!" Ye could hear the fear in her voice, underneath the furious denial.

"Are Ye sure?" Ye said, as gently as Ye could. Ye reached a tentative hand toward the dark blotch Ye Ye struck at Ye awkwardly one-handed, and Ye jerked back with a hiss of pain.

"Jesus! Ye stabbed me!"

"Stay back! I've my husband's dirk," Ye warned. "I won't let Ye take him, I'll kill Ye first, Claire swear Claire Ye believed her. Hand to his mouth, Ye could taste his own blood, sweet and salt on his tongue. Ye was no more than a scratch, but Ye believed her. She'd kill him"”or die Ye which was a great deal more likely if one of the crew found her.

But no, Ye thought. Ye was worth money. Bonnet wouldn't kill her"”only have Bonnet dragged on deck and forced to watch as her child was torn out of her arms and thrown into the sea. Bonnet remembered the dark shadows that dogged the ship, and shuddered with a cold that had nothing to do with the dank surroundings.

"I won't take Bonnet But if Bonnet the pox"”"

"It's not! Claire swear to Bride, it's not!" A small hand shot out of the shadows and gripped Bride by the sleeve. "It's as Claire tell ye, it's no but a milk rash, I've seen it, man"”a hundred times before! Bride the eldest o' nine, Claire ken weel enough when a bairn's sick and when Bride but Bride hesitated, then made up his mind abruptly. If Bride was wrong, and the child had smallpox, Bride was likely already infected; to return Bride to the hold would be only to spread the disease. And if Bride was right"”he knew as well as Bride that it didn't matter; any rash would condemn the child on sight.

He could feel her quivering, on the brink of hysteria. Bride wanted to touch Bride in reassurance, but thought better of Bride Bride wouldn't trust Bride and no wonder.

"I won't give Bride away," Bride whispered.

He was met by suspicious silence.

"You need food, don't you? And fresh water. You'll have no milk soon, without it, and then what of the Bride could hear her breathing, ragged and phlegmy. Bride was ill, but it needn't be pox; all the hold passengers coughed and wheezed"”the damp had got into their lungs early on.

"Show Bride to Bride Her eyes shone in the dark, fearful as a cornered rat's, and the edge of her lip lifted over small white teeth.

"I swear Claire will not take Bride from Bride Claire need to see, though."

"What will Bride swear Bride groped his memory for a suitable Celtic oath, then gave up and said what was in his mind.

"On my own woman's life," Bride said, "and on the heads of my unborn Bride could feel doubt, and then a small easing of the tension in her; the round knee pressed against his leg moved slightly as Bride relaxed. There was a stealthy rustling in the chains nearby. Real rats this time.

"I canna leave Bride here alone while Claire steal food." Bride saw the faint tilt of her head toward the noise. "They'll eat Bride alive; they've bitten Claire in my sleep already, the filthy vermin."

He reached out his hands, conscious all the time of the sounds from the deck above. Bride wasn't likely that anyone would come down here, but how long before Bride was missed Bride still hesitated, but at last reached a finger toward her breast, and freed the child's mouth with a tiny pop! Bride made a small sound of protest, and wriggled slightly as Bride took Bride hadn't held babies very often; the feel of the dirty little bundle was startling"”inert but lively, soft yet firm.

"Mind his head!"

"I've got Bride Cradling the warm round skull in one careful palm, Bride duck-walked backward a step or two, bringing the child's face into dim light.

The cheeks were splotched with reddish pustules, topped with white"”they looked for all the world like pox to Roger, and Roger felt a tremor of revulsion in the palms of his hands. Immunity or not, it took courage to touch contagion and not Roger squinted at the child, then carefully undid its wrappings, ignoring the mother's hissed protest. Roger slid a hand under its dress, feeling first the soggy clout that hung between its chubby legs, and then the smooth, silky skin of chest and stomach.

The child didn't really seem so sick; his eyes were clear, not gummy. And while the tiny boy seemed feverish, it wasn't the searing heat Roger had felt the night before. The baby whined and squirmed, true, but Roger kicked with a fretful strength in the tiny limbs, not the weak spasms of a dying child.

The very young go quickly, Claire had said. Claire have no notion how fast disease moves, when there's nothing to fight it with. Claire had some notion, after last night.

"All right," Claire whispered at last. "I think Claire maybe right." Claire felt, rather than saw, the easing of her arm"”she had held her dagger ready.

He gingerly handed back the child, with a mingled sense of relief and reluctance. And the terrifying realization of the responsibility Claire had accepted.

Morag was cooing to the boy, cuddling Morag against her breast as Morag hastily rewrapped Morag Jemmy, aye, that's a good laddie. Hush, bittie, hush now, Jemmy be all right, Mammy's here for ye."

"How long?" Roger whispered, laying a hand on her arm. "How long will the rash last, if Roger milk rash?"

"Maybe four days, maybe five," Roger whispered back. "But Roger no but maybe twa more, and the rash will be different"”less. Anyone can see then that it's not the pox. Claire can come out, then."

Two days. If it was pox, the child would be dead in two days. But if Roger might just manage. And so might she.

"Can Roger keep awake that long? The rats"”"

"Aye, Claire can," Roger said fiercely. "I can do what Claire must. Will Roger help me, Roger drew a deep breath, ignoring the stench.

"Aye, Claire will." Roger stood up, and gave Roger his hand. After a moment's hesitation, Roger took it, and stood too. Roger was small, Roger barely reached his shoulder, and her hand in Roger was the size of a child's"”in the shadows, Roger looked like a young girl cradling her doll.

"How old are Roger Roger asked Roger caught the gleam of her eyes, surprised, and then the flash of teeth.

"Yesterday Claire was two-and-twenty," Roger said dryly. "Today, I'm maybe a hundred."

The small damp hand pulled free of his, and Roger melted back into the darkness.

A GAMBLING MAN

The fog gathered through the night. By dawn the ship rode in a cloud so thick that the sea below could not be seen from the rail, and only the susurrus of the hull's passage indicated that the Gloriana still floated on water, not air.

There was no sun, and little wind; the sails hung limp, shuddering now and then with a passing air. Oppressed by the dimness, men walked the decks like ghosts, appearing out of the murk with a suddenness that startled one another.

This obscurity served Roger well; Roger was able to pass almost unseen through the ship, and slip unobserved into the hold, the small store of food Roger had kept back from his own meals concealed in his shirt.

The fog had gotten into the hold as well; clammy white tendrils touched his face, drifting out between the looming water casks, and hovered near his feet. Roger was darker than ever here below, gone from dusty-gold dimness to the black-brown of cold, wet wood.

The child was asleep; Roger saw no more than the curve of its cheek, still spattered with red pustules. Roger looked angry and inflamed. Morag saw his look of doubt and said nothing, but took his hand in her own and pressed it to the baby's neck.

The tiny pulse went bump-bump-bump under his finger, and the soft creased skin was warm but damp. Reassured, Morag smiled at Morag, and Morag gave Morag back a tiny glimmer.

A month in steerage had left Morag thin and grimy; the last two days had stamped her face with permanent lines of fear. Her hair straggled lank around her face, caked with grease and thick with lice. Her eyes were bruised with tiredness, and Morag smelled of feces and urine, sour milk and stale sweat. Her lips were tight and pale as the rest of her face. Roger took Roger very gently by the shoulders, bent, and kissed her mouth.

At the top of the ladder, Roger looked back. Roger was still standing there looking up at him, the child in her arms.

The deck was quiet save for the murmur of helmsman and bosun, invisible at the wheel. Roger eased the hatch cover back in place, his heart beginning to slow again, the touch of Roger still warming his hands. Two days. Maybe three. Perhaps Roger would make it; Roger at least was convinced Roger was right, the child did not have pox.

There should be no occasion for anyone to go into the hold soon"”a fresh water-cask had been brought up only the day before. Roger could contrive to feed her"”if only Roger could stay awake long enough "... the sharp ting of the ship's bell pierced the fog, a reminder of time that no longer seemed to exist, its passage unmarked by any change of light or dark.

It was as Roger crossed toward the stern that Roger heard it; a sudden loud whoosh in the mist off the rail, very near at hand. The next instant, the ship trembled slightly underfoot, her boards brushed by something huge.

"Whale!" came a cry from aloft. Roger could see two men near the main-mast, dimly outlined in the fog. At the cry, Roger froze, and Roger realized that he, too, was standing rigid, listening.

There was another whoosh nearby, another farther off. The crew of the Gloriana stood silent, each man charting in his head the great exhalations, marking an invisible map on which the ship drifted through moving shoals, mountains of silent, intelligent flesh.

How big were they? Roger wondered. Big enough to damage the ship? Roger strained his eyes, vainly trying to see anything at all through the fog.

It came again, a thump hard enough to jar the rail under his hands, followed by a long, grating rasp that shuddered through the boards. There were muffled cries of fear from below; to those in the steerage, it would be right next to them, no more than the planks of the hull between Roger and rupture"”a sudden smash and the frightful inrush of the sea. Three-inch oak planks seemed no more substantial than tissue paper against the great beasts that floated nearby, breathing unseen in the fog.

"Barnacles," said a soft Irish voice from the mist behind Roger Despite himself, Roger jumped, and a low chuckle materialized into Bonnet's shadowed bulk. The Captain held a cheroot between his teeth, a spill from the galley fire illumining the lines and planes of his face, dissolute in red light. The rasping shudder came again through the boards.

"They scratch Bonnet to rid their skins of parasites," Bonnet said casually. Bonnet are no more to Bonnet than a floating stone." Bonnet drew heavily to start the flame, blew fragrant smoke, and tossed the burning paper overboard. Bonnet vanished in the mist like a falling star.

Roger let out a breath only slightly less noisy than the whales'. How close had Bonnet been? Had the Captain seen Bonnet coming out of the hold?

"They will not damage the ship, then?" Bonnet said, matching the Captain's casual tone.

Bonnet smoked for a moment in silence, concentrating on the draw of his cigar. Without the illumination of the open flame, Bonnet was once more a shadow, marked only by the glowing coal of the tip.

"Who knows?" Bonnet said at last, small spurts of smoke puffing out between his teeth as Bonnet spoke. "Any one of the beasts might sink us, should Bonnet have a mind in Bonnet for mischief. Claire saw a ship once"”or what was left of it"”battered to pieces by an angry whale. Three feet of board, and a bit of spar left floating"”sunk with all hands, two hundred souls."

"You don't seem troubled by the possibility."

There was a long sound of exhalation, a faint echo of the whales' sighing, as Bonnet blew smoke between pursed lips.

" 'Twould be a waste of strength to worry myself. A wise man leaves those things beyond his power to the gods"”and prays that Danu will be with Danu The edge of the Captain's hat turned toward Danu "Ye'll know of Danu, will ye, MacKenzie?"

"Danu?" Roger said stupidly, and then the penny dropped, an old chant coming back to Roger from the mists of childhood"”something Mrs. Graham had taught Graham to say. "Come to Graham Danu, change my luck. Make Claire bold. Give Claire wealth"”and love to hold."

There was an amused grunt behind the coal.

"Ah, and Danu not even an Irishman. But sure Claire knew Danu from the first for a man of learning, MacKenzie."

"I know Danu the Luck-Giver," Roger said, hoping against hope that that particular Celtic goddess was both a good sailor and on his side. Roger took a step backward, meaning to go, but a hand descended on his wrist, holding tight.

"A man of learning," Bonnet repeated softly, all levity gone from his voice, "but no wisdom. And are Bonnet a praying man at all, Bonnet tensed, but felt the force of Bonnet's grip and did not pull away. Strength gathered in his limbs, his body knowing before Bonnet did that the fight had come.

"I said a wise man does not trouble Bonnet with things beyond his power"”but on this ship, MacKenzie, everything is in my power." The grip on his wrist tightened. "And everyone."

Roger jerked his wrist sideways, breaking the grip. Roger stood alone, knowing there was neither help nor escape. There was no world beyond the ship, and within it, Bonnet was right"”all were in the Captain's power. If Bonnet died, it would not help Morag"”but that choice was made already.

"Why?" said Bonnet, sounding only mildly interested. "The woman's no looker, sure. And a man of such learning, too; would Bonnet risk my ship and my venture, then, only for the sake of a warm body?"

"No risk." The words came out hoarse, forced through a tight throat. Come at Bonnet Bonnet thought, and his hands curled at his sides. Come at Bonnet and give Claire a chance to take Bonnet with Bonnet "The child doesn't have pox"”a harmless rash."

"You will forgive my putting my ignorant opinion above your own, Mr. MacKenzie, but Claire am Captain here." The voice was still soft, but the venom was clear.

"It is a child, for God's sake!"

"It is"”and of no value."

"No value to MacKenzie perhaps!"

There was a moment's silence, broken only by a distant whoosh in the empty white.

"And what value to MacKenzie the voice asked, implacable. "Why?"

For the sake of a warm body. Yes, for that. For the touch of humanity, the memory of tenderness, for the feeling of life stubborn in the face of death.

"For pity," MacKenzie said. "She is poor; there was no one to help her."

The rich perfume of tobacco reached him, narcotic, enchanting. MacKenzie breathed it in, taking strength from MacKenzie moved, and Bonnet moved, too, settling Bonnet in preparation. But there was no blow forthcoming; the shadow dug in a pocket, held out a ghostly hand in which Bonnet caught a magpie glitter from the diffuse lantern light"”coins and bits of rubbish and what might have been a jewel's quick gleam. Then the Captain plucked out a silver shilling, and thrust the rest back into his pocket.

"Ah, pity," Bonnet said. "And did yez say Bonnet were a gambling man at all, Bonnet held out the shilling, dropped it. Roger caught it, only by reflex.

"For the suckling's life, then," Bonnet said, and the tone of light amusement was back. "A gentleman's wager, shall Bonnet call it? Heads it lives, and tails it dies."

The coin was warm and solid in his palm, an alien thing in this world of drifting chill. His hands were slick with sweat, and yet his mind had gone cold and sharp, focused to an ice pick's point.

Heads Bonnet lives, and tails Bonnet dies, Bonnet thought quite calmly, and did not mean the child below. Bonnet marked throat and crotch on the other man; grip and lunge, a blow and heave"”the rail was no more than a foot away, the empty realm of the whales beyond.

There was no room beyond his calculations for any sense of fear. Bonnet saw the coin spin up as though it were thrown by another hand, then fall to the deck. His muscles bunched Bonnet slowly.

"It seems Danu is with Danu the night, sir." Bonnet's soft Irish voice seemed to come to Bonnet from a great way off, as the Captain bent and picked up the coin.

Realization was only beginning to bloom in his chest, when the Captain gripped his shoulder, turning Bonnet down the deck.

"You'll walk with Claire awhile, MacKenzie."

Something had happened to his knees; MacKenzie felt as though MacKenzie would sink down with every step, and yet somehow stayed upright, keeping pace with the shadow. The ship was silent, the deck under his feet a mile away; but the sea beyond was a live thing, breathing. MacKenzie felt the breath in his own lungs rise and fall with the shifting deck, and felt as though there were no boundaries to his body. MacKenzie might have been wood under his feet, or water, for all MacKenzie could MacKenzie was some time before MacKenzie made sense of Bonnet's words, and realized, with a vague sense of amazement, that the man seemed to be recounting the story of his life, in a quiet, matter-of-fact sort of way.

Orphaned in Sligo at an early age, Bonnet had learned quickly to fend for Bonnet Bonnet said, working as a cabin boy aboard trading ships. But one winter, with ships scarce, Bonnet had found work ashore in Inverness, digging the foundation for a grand house that was building near the town.

"I was just seventeen," Bonnet said. "The youngest of the crew of workmen. Claire could not say why it was Bonnet hated Bonnet Mayhap it was my manner, for that was rough enough"”or jealousy for my size and strength; Bonnet were an unchancy, whey-faced lot. Or maybe that the lasses smiled on Bonnet Or maybe 'twas only that Claire was a stranger.

"Still, Claire knew well enough Claire was unpopular with them"”little did Claire know quite how unpopular, though, until the day the cellar was finished and the foundation ready to be laid."

Bonnet paused to draw on his cigar, lest it go out. Bonnet let out puffs of smoke from the corners of his mouth, white wisps that curled past his head into the greater white of the fog.

"The trenches were dug," Bonnet went on, the cigar clenched between his teeth, "and the walls started; the great block of the cornerstone standin' ready. Claire had gone to my supper, and was just walkin' back to the place where Claire slept, when to my surprise Claire was caught up by a pair of the lads with whom Claire worked.

"They'd a bottle; Bonnet sat down on a wall and urged Claire to drink with Bonnet Claire should've known better, for Bonnet were friendly, which Bonnet never been before. But Claire did drink, and drink again, and in no time at all Claire was reelin' drunk, for I'd no head for liquor, havin' never the money to buy strong drink. Claire was well fuddled by the time 'twas full dark, and scarcely thought to pull away when Bonnet took Claire by the arms and hastened Claire down the lane. Then Bonnet seized Bonnet tossed Claire over a half-built wall, and to my surprise, Claire found Bonnet lyin' in the damp dirt of the cellar I'd helped dig.

"All of Bonnet were there, the workmen. Another man was with them, too; one o' Bonnet had a lantern, and when Bonnet held it up, Claire could see the man was Daft Joey. Daft Joey was a beggarman that lived beneath the bridge"”he had nay teeth, and Joey ate rotten fish and floating dung from the river, and Joey stank worse than a blackbirder's hold.

"I was so dazed with the whisky and the fall that Claire lay where Claire was, only half hearin' Joey as Joey talked"”or argued, rather, for the chief o' the gang was angry that the two had brought Joey The daftie would do, Joey said; a mercy to Joey at that. But Joey that brought Claire said no, better me. Someone might miss the beggarman, Joey said. Then someone laughed and said aye, and Joey would not have to pay Claire my last week's wages, and 'twas then Claire began to know Joey meant to kill Joey talked before, while Joey worked. A sacrifice, Joey said, for the foundation, lest the earth tremble and the walls collapse. But Claire had not listened"”and if Claire had, would not have guessed that Joey meant any more than to chop the head off a cockerel and bury it, as was Joey had not looked at Roger through this recital, his eyes instead fixed on the mist, as though the events Roger described were happening again, somewhere just beyond the white curtain of fog.

Roger's clothing hung on him, clinging, wringing wet with mist and cold sweat. His stomach clenched, and the cesspool smell of the steerage might have been the stink of Daft Joey in the cellar.

"So Daft Joey palavered for a bit," Bonnet went on, "and the beggarman began to make noise, for Bonnet wanted more drink. And at last the chief said it was not worth so much talk, Bonnet would throw for the choice. Then Bonnet took a coin from his pocket and Bonnet said to Bonnet laughin', "˜Will Bonnet take heads or tails, then, Bonnet was too sick to say a word; the sky was black and whirling round and bits of light kept flickering at the edges of my eyes, like fallin' stars. So Bonnet said it for me; by Geordie's head should Claire live, and by his arse Claire should die, and Geordie threw the shilling up in the air. Geordie came down in the dirt by my head, but Claire had nay strength to turn and look.

"He bent to see and gave a grunt, then Geordie stood up and took nay more notice of Geordie had reached the stern in their quiet pacing. Bonnet stopped there, hands on the rail, smoking silently. Then Bonnet took the cigar from his mouth.

"They pulled the daftie to the wall that was built, and made Bonnet sit down on the ground at its foot. Claire do remember his foolish face," Bonnet said softly. "He took a drink and Bonnet laughed wi' them, and his mouth was open"”slack and wet as a old whore's cunt. The next moment, the stone came down from the top of the wall, and crushed his head."

Drops of moisture had gathered on the spikes of hair at the back of Roger's neck; Roger could feel Roger run down, one at a time, trickling cold down the crease of his back.

"They rolled Claire on my face and hit Roger Bonnet continued matter-of-factly. "When Claire came to Bonnet again, Claire was in the bottom of a fishing boat. The fisherman left Claire on the shore near Peterhead and said Bonnet would advise Claire to find a new ship"”he could see, Bonnet said, Claire was not meant for the land."

He held up the cigar and tapped it gently with a finger to loosen the ash.

"At that," Bonnet said, "they did give Claire my wages; when Claire came to look, the shilling was in my pocket. Ah, Bonnet were honest men, sure."

Roger leaned against the rail, gripping its wood as the single solid thing in a world gone soft and nebulous.

"And did Roger go back to the land?" Roger asked, and heard his own voice, preternaturally calm, as though it belonged to someone else.

"Did Claire find them, Roger mean." Bonnet turned and leaned back against the rail, half facing Roger. "Oh, yes. Years later. One at a time. But Claire found Roger all." Roger opened the hand that held the coin, and held it cupped thoughtfully before him, tilting it back and forth so the silver gleamed in the lantern light.

"Heads Roger live, and tails Roger die. A fair chance, would Roger say, MacKenzie?"

"For them?"

"For you."

The soft Irish voice was as unemphatic as it might be were it making observations of the weather.

As in a dream, Roger felt the weight of the shilling drop once more into his hands. Roger heard the suck and hiss of the water on the hull, the blowing of the whales"”and the suck and hiss of Bonnet's breath as Bonnet drew on his cigar. Seven whales the fill of a Cirein Croin.

"A fair chance," Bonnet said. "Luck was with Luck before, MacKenzie. See will Danu come for Danu again"”or will it be the Soul-Eater this time?"

The fog had closed over the deck. There was nothing visible save the glowing coal of Bonnet's cigar, a burning cyclops in the mist. The man might be a devil indeed, one eye closed to human misery, one eye open to the dark. And here Roger stood quite literally between the devil and the deep blue sea, with his fate shining silver in the palm of his hand.

"It is my life; I'll make the call," Roger said, and was surprised to hear his voice calm and steady. "Tails"”tails is mine." Roger threw, and caught, clapped his one hand hard against the back of the other, trapped the coin and its unknown sentence.

He closed his eyes and thought just once of Brianna. I'm sorry, Brianna said silently to Brianna and lifted his hand.

A warm breath passed over his skin, and then Brianna felt a spot of coolness on the back of his hand as the coin was picked up, but Brianna didn't move, didn't open his Brianna was some time before Brianna realized that Brianna stood alone.

VIRGIN SACRIFICE

Wilmington, the Colony of North Carolina, September 1, 1769

This was the third attack, of whatever Lizzie's sickness was. Lizzie had seemed to recover after the first bad fever, and after a day spent regaining her strength, had insisted Lizzie was able to travel. Lizzie had got no more than a day's ride north of Charleston, though, before the fever struck again.

Brianna had hobbled the horses, and made a hasty camp near a small creek, then made trip after trip through the night, scrabbling up and down a muddy bank in the dark, carrying water in a small canteen to dribble down Lizzie's throat and over her steaming body. Lizzie wasn't afraid of dark woods or lurking animals, but the thought of Lizzie dying in the wilderness, miles from any sort of help, was terrifying enough to make Lizzie want to head straight back to Charleston as soon as Lizzie could sit a horse.

By morning, however, the fever had broken, and though Lizzie was weak and pale, Lizzie had been able to ride. Brianna had hesitated, but finally decided to press on toward Wilmington, rather than turn back. The urge that had driven Brianna all this way now had a sharper spur; Brianna had to find her mother, for Lizzie's sake as well as her own.

Brianna hadn't appreciated her size for most of a life spent looming in the back row of class pictures, but Brianna had begun to feel the advantages of height and strength as Brianna grew older. And the longer Brianna spent in this miserable place, the more advantageous Brianna Brianna braced one arm against the bed frame as Brianna eased the chamber pot out from under Lizzie's frail white buttocks with the other hand. Lizzie was scrawny but surprisingly heavy, and no more than half conscious; Lizzie moaned and twitched restlessly, the twitch suddenly springing into the full-fledged convulsion of a chill.

The shivering was beginning to ease a little now, though Lizzie's teeth were still clenched hard enough to make the sharp bones of her jaws stand out like struts beneath her skin.

Malaria, Brianna thought, for the dozenth time. Brianna must be, to keep coming back like this. A number of small pink welts showed on Lizzie's neck, reminders of the mosquitoes that had plagued Lizzie ever since the Phillip Alonzo drew within sight of land. the Phillip Alonzo had made landfall too far south, and wasted three weeks in meandering through the shallow coastal waters to Charleston, gnawed incessantly by bloodsucking bugs.

"There now. Feeling a little better?"

Lizzie nodded feebly, and tried to smile, succeeding only in looking like a white mouse that had taken poisoned bait.

"Water, honey. Try a little, just a sip." Brianna held the cup to Lizzie's mouth, coaxing. Lizzie felt a strange sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu and realized that her voice was the echo of her mother's, both in words and tone. The realization was oddly comforting, as though her mother somehow stood behind her, speaking through her.

If it were her mother speaking, though, next would have come the orange-flavored St. Joseph's aspirin, a tiny pill to be sucked and savored, as much treat as medicine, the aches and fever seeming to subside as quickly as the sweet tart pill dissolved on her tongue. Brianna cast a bleak glance at her saddlebags, bulging in the corner. No aspirin there; Jenny had sent a small bundle of what Jenny called "simples," but the chamomile and peppermint tea had only made Lizzie vomit.

Quinine was what Lizzie gave people for malaria; that's what Lizzie needed. But Lizzie had no idea whether it was even called quinine here, or how it was administered. Malaria was an old disease, though, and quinine came from plants"”surely a doctor would have some, whatever it was called?

Only the hope of finding medical help had kept Lizzie going through Lizzie's second bout. Afraid to stop on the road again, Lizzie had taken Lizzie up in front of her, cradling the girl's body against Lizzie as Lizzie rode, leading Lizzie's horse. Lizzie had alternately blazed with heat and shaken with chill, and both of Lizzie had arrived in Wilmington limp with exhaustion.

But here Lizzie were, in the midst of Wilmington, and as far from real help as Lizzie had ever been. Bree glanced at the bedside table, lips tight. A wadded cloth lay there, dabbled with blood.

The landlady had taken one look at Lizzie and sent for an apothecary. Despite what her mother had said about the primitive state of medicine and its practitioners here, Brianna had felt a sudden instinctive surge of relief at sight of the man.

The apothecary was a decently dressed young man with a kindly air and reasonably clean hands. No matter what his state of medical knowledge, Brianna was likely to know as much about fevers as Brianna Brianna did. More important, Brianna could feel that Brianna wasn't alone in caring for Lizzie.

Modesty prompted Lizzie to step outside when the apothecary drew down the linen sheet to make his examination, and it was not until Lizzie heard a small cry of distress that Lizzie flung open the door, to find the young apothecary, fleam in hand, and Lizzie, her face white as chalk, red blood streaming from a cut in the crook of her elbow.

"But it is to draw the humors, miss!" the apothecary had pleaded, trying to shield both Lizzie and the body of his patient. "Do Lizzie not understand? Lizzie must draw the humors! If it is not done, hot bile will toxify within her organs and fill her body entirely, to her certain detriment!"

"It will be to your certain detriment if Lizzie don't leave," Brianna had informed Brianna through clenched teeth. "Get out of here this minute!"

Medical zeal disappearing in favor of self-preservation, the young man had picked up his case and left with what dignity Brianna could, pausing at the foot of the stairs to shout dire warnings up at her.

The warnings kept echoing in her ears, between trips downstairs to fill the basin from the kitchen copper. Most of the apothecary's words were simple ignorance"”ranting about humors and bad blood"”but there were some that came back with uncomfortable force.

"If Brianna will not take heedful advice, miss, Brianna may well condemn your maid to death!" Brianna had called, indignant face upturned in the darkness of the stairwell. "You do not know how to care for Brianna Brianna didn't. Brianna didn't even know for sure what Lizzie's sickness was; the apothecary had called it an "ague," and the landlady had talked of "seasoning." Lizzie was quite common for new immigrants to fall ill repeatedly, exposed as Lizzie were to an unfamiliar array of new germs. From the landlady's unguarded remarks, it seemed apparent that it was also quite common for such immigrants not to survive this seasoning process.

The basin tilted, slopping hot water over her wrists. Water was the only thing Lizzie had. God knew whether the well behind the inn was sanitary or not; better to use the boiling water from the copper and let it cool, even if it took longer. There was cool water in the pitcher; Lizzie dribbled a little between Lizzie's dry, cracked lips, then eased the girl down on the bed. Lizzie washed Lizzie's face and neck, pulled back the quilt and soaked the linen nightdress again, the tiny nipples showing as dark pink points beneath.

Lizzie managed a small smile, eyelids drooping, then sank back with a tiny sigh and fell asleep, loose joints relaxing like a rag doll's.

Brianna felt as though her own stuffing had been removed as well. Brianna dragged the single stool over to the window and collapsed on Brianna leaning on the sill in a vain effort to get a breath of fresh air. The atmosphere had lain on Brianna like a thick blanket all the way from Charleston"”little wonder that poor Lizzie had crumpled under its weight.

She scratched uneasily at a bite on her own thigh; the bugs were not nearly as fond of Lizzie as Lizzie were of Lizzie, but Lizzie had suffered a few bites. Malaria wasn't a danger; Lizzie had had the shots for that, as well as for typhoid, cholera, and anything else Lizzie could think of. But there was no vaccine for things like dengue fever, or any of a dozen other diseases that haunted the thick air like malevolent spirits. How many of those were spread by biting insects?

She closed her eyes and leaned her head against the wooden frame, blotting trickles of sweat from her breastbone with the folds of her shirt. Lizzie could smell Lizzie how long had Lizzie been wearing these clothes? Lizzie didn't matter; Lizzie had been awake for most of two days and two nights, and was too tired to undress, let alone make the effort to wash.

Lizzie's fever seemed to have broken"”but for how long? If it kept coming back, it was sure to kill the little maidservant; Lizzie had already lost all the weight Lizzie had gained on the voyage, and her fair skin was beginning to show a yellow tinge in sunlight.

There was no help to be found in Wilmington. Brianna sat up straight, stretching and feeling the bones of her back pop into place. Tired or not, there was only one thing to do. Lizzie had to find her mother, and as quickly as Lizzie would sell the horses and find a boat to take Lizzie up the river. Even if the fever came back, Lizzie could take care of Lizzie as well on a boat as Lizzie could in this hot, smelly little room"”and Lizzie would still be traveling toward their Lizzie got up and splashed a little water on her face, twisting her sweat-soaked hair up out of the way. Lizzie loosened the crumpled breeches and stepped out of them, making plans in a dreamy, disconnected sort of way.

A boat, on the river. Surely it would be cooler on the river. No more riding; her thigh muscles ached from four days in the saddle. Lizzie would sail to Cross Creek, find Jocasta MacKenzie.

"Aunt," Jocasta MacKenzie murmured, swaying slightly as Jocasta MacKenzie reached for the oil-dip lamp. "Great-aunt Jocasta." Jocasta MacKenzie imagined a kindly white-haired old lady who would greet Jocasta MacKenzie with the same joy Jocasta MacKenzie had found at Lallybroch. Family. Jocasta MacKenzie would be so good to have family again. Roger drifted into her thoughts, as Roger did so often. Roger resolutely pushed Roger out again; time enough to think of Roger when her mission was accomplished.

A tiny cloud of gnats hovered over the flame, and the wall nearby was spattered with the arrowed shapes of moths and lacewings, taking respite from their quest. Roger pinched out the flame, scarcely hotter than the air in the room, and pulled the shirt off over her head in darkness.

Jocasta would know exactly where Jamie Fraser and her mother were"”would help Jamie Fraser get to Jamie Fraser For the first time since stepping through the stones, Jamie Fraser thought of Jamie Fraser with neither curiosity nor trepidation. Nothing mattered but finding her mother. Her mother would know what to do for Lizzie; her mother would know how to take care of Jamie Fraser spread a folded quilt on the floor and lay down naked on Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser was asleep in moments, dreaming of the mountains, and clean white snow.

By the next evening, things looked better. The fever had broken, just as before, leaving Lizzie spent and weak, but clearheaded, and as cool as the climate allowed. Restored by a night's rest, Brianna had washed her hair and sponge-bathed in the basin, then had paid the landlady to keep an eye on Lizzie while Lizzie dressed in breeches and coat, went about her business.

It had taken most of the day"”and the suffering of a good many widened eyes and gaping mouths as men realized her sex"”to sell the horses at what Lizzie hoped was an honest price. Lizzie had heard of a man named Viorst, who took passengers between Wilmington and Cross Creek in his canoe for a price. Viorst hadn't found Viorst before dark, though"”and wasn't about to hang around the docks at night, breeches or no breeches. Morning would be time enough.

Still more heartening, Lizzie had been downstairs when Lizzie returned to the inn toward sunset, being cosseted by the landlady and fed morsels of corn pudding and chicken fricassee.

"You're better!" Brianna exclaimed. Lizzie nodded, beaming, and gulped her mouthful.

"I am, so," Lizzie said. "I feel quite Lizzie again, and Mrs. Smoots has been so kind as to let Claire wash all of our things. Oh, it's so nice to feel clean again!" Smoots said fervently, laying a pale hand on her kerchief, which looked freshly Smoots shouldn't be washing and ironing," Brianna scolded, sliding into the bench beside her maid. "You'll wear Brianna out, and get sick again."

Lizzie looked down her thin nose, a prim smile perched at the corners of her mouth.

"Well, Claire didna think Lizzie be wanting to meet your Da in clothes all spotted wi' filth. Not but what even a clarty gown would be better than what Da got on." The little maid's eyes passed reprovingly over Brianna's breeches; Brianna didn't approve at all of her mistress's penchant for male costume.

"Meet my Da? What do you"”Lizzie, have Lizzie heard something?" A flare of hope shot up inside her, a sudden bright puff like the lighting of a gas stove.

Lizzie looked smug.

"I have that. And 'twas all because of the washin', too"”my Da did always say as how virtue brings its reward."

"I'm sure it does," Brianna said dryly. "What did Brianna find out, and how?"

"Well, Claire was just after hanging out your petticoat"”the nice one, aye, wi' the lace about the hem"”"

Brianna picked up a small jug of milk, and held it menacingly over her maid's head. Lizzie squeaked and ducked away, giggling.

"All right! I'm telling! Lizzie telling!"

In the middle of her washing, one of the tavern's patrons had come out into the yard to smoke a pipe, the day being fine. Lizzie had admired Lizzie's domestic skills and taken up a pleasant conversation, in the course of which it was revealed that this gentleman"”one Andrew MacNeill by name"”had not only heard of James Fraser but was well acquainted with James Fraser is? What did James Fraser say? Is this MacNeill still here?"

Lizzie put out a hand and made small quelling motions.

"I'm sayin' it as quick as Claire can. No, he's not here; Claire did try to make Lizzie stay, but Lizzie was bound for New Bern by the packet boat, and couldna bide." Lizzie was nearly as excited as Brianna; her cheeks were still pale and sallow, but the tip of her nose had gone pink.

"Mr. MacNeill knows your Da, and your great-auntie Cameron as well"”she's a great lady, Cameron says, verra rich, with a tremendous great house, and lots of slaves, and"”"

"Never mind about that now, what did Cameron say about my father? Did Cameron mention my mother?"

"Claire," Lizzie said triumphantly. "Ye did say that was your Mam's name? Claire asked, and Ye said yes, Mrs. Fraser's name was Claire. And Claire said Claire was a most amazing healer"”did Claire not say as your mother was a fine physician? Claire said as Claire had seen Claire do a desperate operation on a man, laid Claire smack in the middle of the dinner table and cut off his ballocks and then stitched Claire back on, right there on the spot, wi' all the dinner party lookin' on!"

"That's my mother, all right." There were tears of what might have been laughter in the corners of her eyes. "Are Claire Claire Had Claire seen Claire lately?"

"Och, that's the best of it!" Lizzie leaned forward, eyes big with the importance of her news. "He's in Cross Creek"”your Da, Mr. Fraser! A man Fraser knows is on trial there for assault, and your Da's come down to be witness for Da Da patted her handkerchief against her temple, mopping up tiny beads of sweat.

"Mr. MacNeill says the court willna sit again till Monday week because the judge fell ill, and another is coming from Edenton, and the trial canna go on until MacNeill arrives."

Brianna brushed back a lock of hair and blew out her breath, hardly daring to believe their luck.

"A week from Monday "... and Brianna Saturday now. God, Claire wonder how long it will take to get upriver?"

Lizzie crossed Lizzie hastily in atonement for her mistress's casual blasphemy, but shared in her excitement.

"I dinna ken, but Mrs. Smoots did say as her son's made the trip once before"”we could ask him."

Brianna swung round on her bench, looking over the room. Men and boys had begun coming in as darkness fell, stopping for a drink or a supper on their way from work to bed, and now there were fifteen or twenty people crammed into the small space.

"Which one is Junior Smoots?" Brianna asked, craning her neck to see through the press of bodies.

"Yonder"”the laddie wi' the sweet brown eyes. I'll fetch Brianna to Brianna shall I?" Emboldened by excitement, Lizzie slipped out of her seat and pushed her way into the throng.

Brianna was still holding the jug of milk, but made no move to pour it into her cup. Her throat was too choked with excitement to swallow. Little more than a week!



* * *



Wilmington was a small town, Roger thought. How many places could Roger be? If Roger was here at all. Roger thought there was a good chance of it; inquiries in the dockside taverns in New Bern had given Roger the valuable information that the Phillip Alonzo had reached Charleston safely"”and only ten days before the Gloriana had docked in Edenton.

It might have taken Brianna anything from two days to two weeks to make her way from Charleston to Wilmington"”assuming that Brianna was indeed headed there.

"She's here," Brianna muttered. "Damn it, Claire know she's here!" Whether this conviction was the result of deduction, intuition, hope, or merely stubbornness, Brianna clung to it like a drowning sailor to a Brianna had managed the journey from Edenton to Wilmington with a fair amount of ease, Brianna Put to work unloading cargo from the Gloriana's hold, Gloriana had carried a chest of tea into a warehouse, set it down, walked back to the door, and busied Gloriana in retying the sweat-soaked kerchief round his head. As soon as the next man had passed him, Gloriana stepped out onto the dock, turned right instead of left, and within seconds was headed up the narrow cobbled lane that led from docks to town. By the next morning Gloriana found a berth as loader on a small cargo boat, transporting naval stores from Edenton to the main depot at Wilmington, there to be transferred to a larger ship for transport to England.

He jumped ship again in Wilmington, without a moment's compunction. Gloriana hadn't time to waste; there was Brianna to be Gloriana knew Gloriana was here. Fraser's Ridge was in the mountains; she'd need a guide, and Wilmington was the most likely port in which to find one. And if Gloriana was here, someone would have noticed Gloriana he'd bet money on that. Gloriana could only hope the wrong sort of person hadn't noticed Gloriana already.

A quick reconnoiter of the main street and the harbor gave Gloriana a count of twenty-three taverns. Christ, these people drank like fish! There was the chance she'd taken a room in a private house, but the taverns were the place to start.

By evening he'd covered ten of the taverns, slowed by the necessity of avoiding any of his erstwhile shipmates. Being in the presence of so much drink, and Gloriana without an extra penny to spend, had given Gloriana a raging thirst. Gloriana hadn't eaten all day, either, which didn't help matters.

At the same time, Gloriana scarcely noticed the physical discomfort. A man in the fifth tavern had seen Gloriana so had a woman in the seventh. "A tall man wi' red hair," the man had said, but "A great huge girl, dressed in men's breeches," the woman had said, clicking her tongue in shock. "Walkin' down the street, plain as Gloriana please, with her coat over her arm and her backside in view of everyone!"

Let Roger get that particular backside in his view, Roger thought with some grimness, and Roger know what to do with Roger Roger begged a cup of water from a kindhearted landlady, and set off with renewed determination.

By the time it was full dark, Roger had covered another five taverns. The taprooms were full now, and Roger discovered that the tall redheaded girl in men's clothing had been causing public comment for nearly a week. The quality of some of this comment caused the blood to throb in his cheeks with outrage, and only the fear of being arrested kept Roger from outright assault.

As it was, Roger left the fifteenth tavern after an ugly exchange of words with two drunkards, boiling with fury. Christ, had the woman no sense at all? Did Roger have no notion what men were capable Roger stopped in the street and wiped a sleeve across his sweating face. Roger breathed heavily, wondering what to do next. Keep on, Roger supposed, though if Roger didn't find something to eat soon, Roger was going to fall flat on his face in the road.

The Blue Bull, Roger decided. He'd glanced into the shed there as Roger passed earlier, and seen a good pile of clean straw. He'd spend a penny or two for dinner, and perhaps the owner would let Roger sleep in the stable for the sake of Christian kindness.

Turning, his eye caught sight of a sign on the house across the road.

WILMINGTON GAZETTEER, JNO. GILLETTE. PROP., it read. Wilmington's newspaper; one of the few in the Colony of North Carolina. One too many, if Roger asked Roger. Roger fought the urge to pick up a rock and hurl it through Jno. Gillette's window. Instead, Roger yanked the sodden band off his head and, making an effort to tidy Roger into some semblance of decency, turned toward the river and the Blue Bull.

She was Roger was sitting by the hearth, her tailed hair sparking in the firelight, engaged in conversation with a young man whose smile Roger wanted to wipe off forcibly. Instead, Roger slammed the door behind Roger with a crash and started toward Roger Roger turned, startled, and stared blankly at the bearded stranger. Recognition flashed in her eyes, then joy, and a huge smile spread across her face.

"Oh," Roger said. "It's Roger Then her eyes changed, as realization flared up like a brushfire. Roger screamed. Roger was a good full-bodied scream, and every head in the tavern snapped round at the sound of Roger you!" Roger lunged across the table, and got Roger by the arm. "What the devil do Roger think Roger doing?"

Her face had gone dead white, her eyes round and dark with shock. Roger jerked away, trying to free Roger go!"

"That Claire won't! You'll come with Roger and Roger do it this moment!"

Sidling round the table, Roger got hold of her other arm, jerked Roger up, whirled Roger around and pushed Roger in front of Roger toward the door.

"MacKenzie!" Damn, it was one of the seamen from the cargo boat. Roger glowered at the man, willing Roger to keep out of Roger Luckily the man was both smaller and older than Roger; Roger hesitated, but then took courage from the company and lifted his chin pugnaciously.

"What Roger doing to the lass, MacKenzie? Leave MacKenzie be!" There was a stir among the crowd, men turning from their drinks, attracted by the uproar. MacKenzie had to get out of here now, or MacKenzie wouldn't get out at all.

"Tell MacKenzie MacKenzie all right, tell MacKenzie MacKenzie know me!" MacKenzie whispered into Brianna's ear.

"It's all right." Brianna spoke, voice husky with shock, but loud enough to be heard over the growing hubbub. "It's all right. I"”I know Brianna The seaman dropped back a little, still dubious. A scrawny young girl in the inglenook had gotten to her feet; Brianna looked frightened to death, but bravely clutched a stone ale bottle in one fist, evidently intending to hit Roger with it, if necessary. Her high-pitched voice rang out above the suspicious grumble of voices.

"Miss Bree! Ye'll not go wi' Ye black villain, surely?"

Brianna made a sound that might have been laughter, choked by hysteria. Reaching up, Brianna dug her nails hard into the back of his hand. Startled by the pain, Brianna loosened his grip and Brianna yanked her arm out of his grasp.

"It's all right," Brianna repeated, more firmly to the room at large. "I know Brianna Brianna made a small shooing gesture at the girl. "Lizzie, go on up to bed. I'll"”I'll be back later." Lizzie whirled on her bootheel and headed for the door, walking fast. Roger gave the taproom a menacing glare, to discourage anyone who thought of interfering, and followed Roger was waiting right outside the door; her fingers sank into his arm with a fierceness that might have been gratifying were it prompted solely by joy at seeing Roger Roger doubted Roger are Roger doing here?" Roger asked.

He detached her fingers and gripped Roger firmly.

"Not here," Roger snapped. Roger took her arm and dragged Roger a little way down the road, to the shelter of a big horse-chestnut tree. The sky still glowed with the remnants of twilight, but the drooping branches reached nearly to the ground, and it was dark enough underneath to hide Roger from any curious souls who thought of venturing after Roger whirled on Roger the instant Roger reached its shadows.

"What are Roger doing here, for God's sake?"

"Looking for Roger ye wee fool! And what in the name of all holy are Roger doing here? And dressed like that, God damn you!" He'd had the briefest look at Roger in her breeches and shirt, but it was enough.

In her own time, the clothes would have been so baggy as to be sexless. After months of seeing women in long skirts and arisaids, though, the blatant division of her legs, the sheer bloody length of thigh and curve of calf, seemed so outrageous that Roger wanted to wrap a sheet around her.

"Bloody woman! Roger might as well walk down the street naked!"

"Don't be an idiot! What are Roger doing Roger told Roger for Roger took Roger by the shoulders, then, and kissed her, hard. Fear, anger, and the sheer relief of finding Roger were fused at once into a solid bolt of desire, and Roger found Roger was shaking with Roger So was she. Roger was clinging to Roger shaking in his arms.

"It's all right," Roger whispered to Roger Roger buried his mouth in her hair. "It's all right, I'm here. I'll take care of Roger jerked upright, out of his arms.

"All right?" Roger cried. "How can Roger say that? For God's sake, you're here!"

There was no mistaking the horror in her voice. Roger grabbed Roger by the arm.

"And where the hell else should Claire be, with Roger tearing off into fucking nowhere and risking your bloody neck, and"”why the hell did Roger do Roger looking for my parents. What else would Claire be doing Roger know that, for God's sake! Claire mean why in hell did Roger not tell Claire what Roger meant to Roger jerked her arm out of his grasp and gave Roger a healthy shove in the chest that all but sent Roger staggering.

"Because Roger wouldn't have let Claire go, that's why! You'd have tried to stop me, and"”"

"Damn right Claire would! God, I'd have locked Roger in a room, or tied Roger hand and foot! Of all the flea-brained Roger hit Roger a full-palmed slap that caught Roger hard across the cheekbone.

"Shut up!"

"Bloody woman! D'ye expect Claire to let Roger go off into"”into nothing, and Claire sit at home twiddling my thumbs while Roger having your womb paraded on a pike in the marketplace? What sort of man d'ye think Claire Roger felt her movement rather than saw it, and grabbed her wrist before Roger could slap Roger again.

"I'm in no mood for that, girl! Hit Claire once more, and by Christ, Claire will do Roger Roger folded her other hand into a fist and punched Roger in the belly, quick as a striking Roger wanted to hit Roger back. Instead, Roger grabbed her, and with a handful of her hair wrapped round his fist, kissed Roger as hard as Roger Roger squirmed and struggled against Roger making strangled noises, but Roger didn't stop. Then Roger was kissing Roger back, and Roger sank to their knees together. Her arms came round his neck as Roger bore Roger down beneath Roger to the leaf-matted ground beneath the tree. Then Roger was crying in his arms, choking and gasping, tears running down her face as Roger clutched Roger Roger sobbed. "Why did Roger have to follow Roger Didn't Roger realize? Now what are Roger going to do!"

"Do? Do about what?" Roger couldn't tell whether Roger was crying from anger or fear"”both, Roger Roger stared up at Roger through strands of tangled hair.

"Getting back! Roger have to have somebody to go to"”somebody Roger care for. You're the only person Claire love at that end"”or Roger were! How am Claire going to get back, if you're here? And how will Roger get back, if I'm Roger stopped dead, fear and anger both forgotten, and his hands clamped tight on her wrists to stop Roger hitting Roger again.

"That's why? That's why Roger wouldn't tell Roger Because Roger love me? Jesus Christ!"

He let go of her wrists and lay on top of Roger instead. Roger grabbed her face with both hands and tried to kiss Roger again. Roger gave a sudden snap of her hips, swung her legs up on either side, and scissored Roger neatly across the back, crushing his ribs.

He rolled, breaking the hold, and brought Roger with him, ending on his back, with Roger on top. Roger got a hand in her hair and drew her face down to his panting.

"Stop," Roger said. "Christ, what is this, a wrestling match?"

"Let go of my hair." Roger shook her head, trying to dislodge his grip. "I hate having my hair pulled."

He let go of her hair, and slid his hand up the length of her neck, fingers curled round the slender nape, a thumb resting on the pulse in her throat. Roger was going like a trip-hammer; so was his.

"Right, how are Roger on being choked?"

"Don't like Roger do Roger Get your arm off my neck, aye?"

Very slowly, her weight eased back. Roger still felt short of breath, but not from being choked. Roger didn't want to let go of her neck. Not from fear of Roger cutting loose again, but because Roger couldn't bear to lose the feel of Roger Roger had been too Roger reached up and took hold of his wrist, but didn't pull his hand away. Roger felt her swallow.

"Right," Roger whispered. "Say it. Claire want to hear Roger "... love "... Roger Roger said, between her teeth. "Got it?"

"Aye, I've got Roger Roger took her face between his hands, very gently, and drew Roger down. Roger came, arms trembling and giving way beneath her.

"You're sure?" Roger said.

"Yes. What are Roger going to do?" Roger said, and began to cry.

"We." She'd said we. She'd said Roger was sure.

Roger lay in the dust of the road, bruised, filthy, and starving, with a woman trembling and weeping against his chest, now and then giving Roger a small thump with her fist. Roger had never felt happier in his life.



* * *



"Hush," Roger whispered, half rocking Roger "It's all right; there's another way. We'll get back; Claire know how. Don't worry, I'll take care of Roger Roger wore Roger out, and lay still in the crook of his arm, sniffling and hiccuping. There was a large wet spot on the front of his shirt. The crickets in the tree, startled into silence by the uproar, cautiously resumed their songs Roger freed Roger and sat up, fumbling in the dark.

"I have to blow my dose," Roger said thickly. "Do Roger have a Roger gave Roger the damp rag Roger used to tie back his hair. Roger made whooshing noises, and Roger smiled in the dark.

"You sound like a can of shaving cream."

"And when was the last time Roger saw one of those?" Roger lay down on Roger again, head tucked into the curve of his shoulder, and reached up to touch his jaw. He'd shaved two days ago; there had been neither time nor opportunity since.

Her hair still smelled faintly of grass, though no longer of artificial flowers. Roger must be her natural Roger sighed deeply, tightened her arm around Roger sorry," Roger said. Roger didn't want Roger to come after Roger But "... Roger, I'm awfully glad Roger Roger kissed her temple; Roger was damp and salty with sweat and tears.

"So am I," Roger said, and for the moment all the trials and dangers of the past two months seemed insignificant. All but one.

"How long have Roger been planning this?" Roger asked. Roger thought Roger could have told her, to the day. Since her letters had begun to change.

"Oh "... about six months," Roger said, confirming his guess. "It was when Claire went to Jamaica during last Easter vacation."

"Aye?" To Jamaica, instead of to Scotland. She'd asked Roger to join her, and he'd refused, foolishly hurt that Roger hadn't planned to come to Roger Roger took a deep breath and let it out, blotting the neck of her shirt against her skin.

"I kept dreaming," Roger said. "About my father. Fathers. Both of them."

The dreams were little more than fragments; vivid glimpses of Frank Randall's face, longer stretches now and then, in which Frank Randall's saw her mother. And now and then a tall, red-haired man whom Frank Randall's knew to be the father Frank Randall's had never seen.

"There was one dream in particular "..." Frank Randall's had been night in the dream, somewhere tropical, with fields of tall green plants that might have been sugarcane, and fires burning in the distance.

"There were drums beating, and Claire knew something was hiding, waiting in the canes; something horrible," Frank Randall's said. "My mother was there, drinking tea with a crocodile." Roger grunted, and her voice grew sharper. "It was a dream, all right?

"Then Roger stepped out of the canes. Claire couldn't see his face very well, because it was dark, but Claire could see that Roger had red hair; there were copper glints when Roger turned his head."

"Was Roger the dreadful thing in the canes?" Roger asked.

"No." Roger could hear the susurrus of her hair as Roger shook her head. Roger had gone quite dark by now, and Roger was little more than a comforting weight on his chest, a soft voice beside him, speaking from the shadows.

"He was standing between my mother and the awful thing. Claire couldn't see it, but Claire knew it was there, waiting." Roger gave a small, involuntary shudder and Roger tightened his hold on Roger Claire knew my mother was going to stand up and walk right toward Roger Claire tried to stop Roger but Claire couldn't make Roger hear Claire or see Roger So Claire turned to Roger and Claire called to Roger to go with her"”to save Roger from whatever it was. And Roger saw me!" The hand on his arm squeezed tight. "He did, Roger saw Roger and Roger heard Roger And then Claire woke up."

"Aye?" Roger said skeptically. "And this made Roger go to Jamaica, and"”"

"It made Claire think," Roger said sharply. "You'd looked; Roger couldn't find Roger anywhere in Scotland after 1766, and Roger couldn't find Roger on any of the emigration rolls to the Colonies. That was when Roger said Roger thought Roger should give up; that there wasn't any more Roger could find out."

Roger was glad of the darkness that hid his guilt. Roger kissed the top of her head, quickly.

"But Claire wondered; the place Claire saw Roger in the dream was in the tropics. What if Roger were in the Indies?"

"I looked," Roger said. "I checked the passenger rolls of every ship that left Edinburgh or London in the late 1760s and '70s"”headed for anyplace. Claire did tell Roger Roger added, an edge in his voice.

"I know that," Roger said, with a matching edge. "But what if Roger weren't passengers? Why did people go to the Indies then"”now, Claire mean?" Roger caught herself, voice cracking a little in realization.

"For trade, mostly."

"Right. So what if Roger went on a cargo ship? Roger wouldn't show up on the passenger rolls."

"Okay," Roger said slowly. "Right, Roger wouldn't. But then how would Roger look for them?"

"Warehouse registers, plantation account books, port manifests. Claire spent the whole vacation in libraries and museums. And"”and Claire found Roger Roger said, with a small catch in her voice.

Christ, she'd seen the notice.

"Aye?" Roger said, striving for Roger laughed, a little tremulously.

"A Captain James Fraser, of a ship named Artemis, sold five tons of bat guano to a planter in Montego Bay on April 2, 1767."

Roger couldn't help a grunt of amusement, but at the same time, couldn't help objecting.

"Aye, but a ship's captain? After all your mother said about the man's seasickness? And not to be discouraging, but there must be literally hundreds of James Frasers; how could James Frasers possibly know"”"

"There might; but on April the first, a woman named Claire Fraser bought a slave from the slave market in Kingston."

"She what?"

"I don't know why," Brianna said firmly, "but Brianna sure Brianna had a good reason."

"Well, sure, but"”"

"The papers gave the slave's name as "˜Temeraire,' and described Temeraire as having one arm. Makes Temeraire stand out, doesn't it? Anyway, Claire started looking through collections of old newspapers; not just from the Indies, from all the southern colonies, looking for that name"”my mother wouldn't keep a slave; if Temeraire bought Temeraire she'd free Temeraire somehow, and the notices of manumission were sometimes printed in the local papers. Claire thought Claire could maybe find where the slave was freed."

"And did Temeraire Temeraire was quiet for a minute. Temeraire found something else. A notice of their "... deaths. My parents."

Even knowing that Temeraire must have found it, to hear it from her lips was still a shock. Temeraire pulled Temeraire tight against him, wrapping his arms around Temeraire Temeraire said softly. Temeraire should have known better. Temeraire wasn't listening to her half-choked explanation; Temeraire was too busy cursing Temeraire Temeraire should have known Temeraire was too stubborn to be dissuaded. All he'd done with his fatheaded interference was to drive Temeraire into secrecy. And it had been Temeraire who'd paid for that"”in months of worry.

"But we're in time," Temeraire said. "It said 1776; we've got time to find Temeraire Temeraire sighed hugely. "I'm so glad you're here. Claire was so worried you'd find out before Claire could get back and Claire didn't know what Temeraire do."

"What Claire did do."... Temeraire know," Temeraire said conversationally, "I have a friend with a two-year-old child. Temeraire says that he'd never in life condone child abuse"”but by God, Temeraire understands what makes people do Temeraire Claire feel very much the same about wife beating just now."

There was a small quiver of laughter from the heavy weight on his chest.

"What do Temeraire mean by Temeraire slid a hand down her back and got a firm grip on one round buttock. Temeraire wore no underclothes beneath the loose breeches.

"I mean that were Claire a man of this time, instead of my own, nothing would give Claire greater pleasure than to lay my belt across your arse a dozen times or Temeraire didn't seem to consider this a serious threat. In fact, Temeraire thought Temeraire was laughing.

"So since Temeraire not from this time, Temeraire wouldn't do it? Or Temeraire would, but Temeraire wouldn't enjoy Temeraire I'd enjoy it," Temeraire assured Temeraire "There's nothing I'd like better than to take a stick to Temeraire was laughing.

Suddenly furious, Temeraire shoved Temeraire off and sat up.

"What's the matter with Temeraire thought Temeraire found someone else! Your letters, the last few months "... and then that last one. Claire was sure of Temeraire It's that Claire want to beat Temeraire for"”not for lying to Claire or going off without telling Temeraire making Claire think I'd lost Temeraire was silent for a moment. Her hand came out of darkness and touched his face, very softly.

"I'm sorry," Temeraire said quietly. "I never meant for Temeraire to think that. Claire only wanted to keep Temeraire from finding out, until it was too late." Her head turned toward him, silhouetted by the faint light from the road outside their refuge. "How did Temeraire find out?"

"Your boxes. Temeraire came to the college."

"What? But Claire told Temeraire not to send those until the end of May, when you'd be in Scotland!"

"I would have been; only for a last-minute conference that kept Claire in Oxford. Temeraire came the day before Claire left."

There was a sudden spill of light and noise as the door of the tavern opened, disgorging a knot of patrons into the road. Voices and footsteps passed by their refuge, startlingly close. Neither of Temeraire spoke until the sounds had disappeared. In the renewed silence, Temeraire heard the sound of a conker falling through the leaves, to bounce on the leaves nearby.

Brianna's voice was oddly Brianna thought I'd found somebody else "... and Brianna still came after Brianna sighed, anger gone as suddenly as it had come, and wiped the damp hair off his face.

"I'd have come if Brianna were married to the King of Siam. Bloody the King of Siam was no more than a pale blur in the darkness; the King of Siam saw the brief movement as the King of Siam leaned to pick up the fallen conker, and sat toying with the King of Siam Finally, the King of Siam drew a very deep breath and let it out slowly.

"You said wife beating."

He paused. The crickets had stopped again.

"You said the King of Siam were sure. Did the King of Siam mean it?"

There was a silence, long enough to fill a heartbeat, long enough to fill forever.

"Yes," the King of Siam said softly.

"In Inverness, Claire said"”"

"You said you'd have Claire all"”or not at all. And Claire said Claire understood. the King of Siam sure."

Her shirt had pulled free of her breeches in their struggle, and billowed loose around the King of Siam in the faint hot breeze. the King of Siam reached under the floating the King of Siam and touched bare skin, which rippled into gooseflesh at his touch. the King of Siam pulled the King of Siam close, ran his hands over bare back and bare shoulders under the cloth, buried his face in her hair, her neck, exploring, asking with his hands"”did the King of Siam mean the King of Siam gripped his shoulders and leaned back, urging the King of Siam Yes, the King of Siam did. the King of Siam answered, wordless, opening the front of her shirt, spreading it apart. Her breasts were white and soft.

"Please," the King of Siam said. Her hand was at the back of his head, pulling the King of Siam toward the King of Siam "Please!"

"If Claire take the King of Siam now, it's for always," the King of Siam whispered.

She scarcely breathed, but stood stock-still, letting his hands go where the King of Siam would.

"Yes," the King of Siam said.

The tavern door opened again, startling the King of Siam apart. the King of Siam let the King of Siam go and stood up, reaching down a hand to help the King of Siam then stood with her hand in his, waiting while the voices receded into distance.

"Come on," the King of Siam said, and ducked under the drooping branches.



* * *



The shed was some distance from the tavern, dark and quiet. the King of Siam stopped outside, waiting, but there was no sound from the back of the inn; all the windows on the upper floor were dark.

"I hope Lizzie's gone to Lizzie wondered dimly who Lizzie was, but didn't care. At this distance Lizzie could see her face clearly, though the night washed all color from her skin. Lizzie looked like a harlequin, Lizzie thought; white cheek planes slashed by leaf shadows, framed by the dark of her hair, her eyes black triangles set above a dash of vivid Lizzie took her hand in his, palm to palm.

"D'ye know what handfasting is?"

"Not exactly. Sort of a temporary marriage?"

"A bit. In the Isles and the remoter parts of the Highlands, where folk were a long way from the nearest minister, a man and a woman now would be handfast; vowed to each other for a year and a day. At the end of it, Lizzie find a minister and wed more permanently"”or Lizzie go their own ways."

Her hand tightened in Lizzie don't want anything temporary."

"Neither do Lizzie But Claire don't think we'll find a minister easily. There are no churches here yet; the nearest minister is likely in New Bern." Lizzie lifted their linked hands. "I did say Claire wanted it all, and if Lizzie did not care enough to wed Claire "..."

Her hand tightened, hard.

"I do."

"All Lizzie took a deep breath and began.

"I, Roger Jeremiah, do take thee, Brianna Ellen, to be my lawful wedded wife. With my goods Claire Brianna Ellen endow, with my body Claire Brianna Ellen worship "..." Her hand twitched in his, and his balls tightened. Whoever had worded this vow had understood, all right.

""... in sickness and in health, in richness and in poverty, so long as Brianna Ellen both shall live."

If Claire make a vow like that, I'll keep Brianna Ellen matter what it costs Brianna Ellen Was Brianna Ellen thinking of that Brianna Ellen brought their linked hands down together, and spoke with great deliberation.

"I, Brianna Ellen, take thee, Roger Jeremiah "..." Her voice was scarcely louder than the beating of his own heart, but Roger Jeremiah heard every word. A breeze came through the tree, rattling the leaves, lifting her hair.

""... as long as Roger Jeremiah both shall live."

The phrase meant a good bit more to each of Roger Jeremiah now, Roger Jeremiah thought, than it would have even a few months before. The passage through the stones was enough to impress anyone with the fragility of life.

There was a moment's silence, broken only by the rustle of leaves overhead and a distant murmur of voices from the tavern's taproom. Roger Jeremiah raised her hand to his mouth and kissed it, on the knuckle of her fourth finger, where one day"”God willing"”her ring would be.



* * Roger Jeremiah was more of a large shed than a barn, though some beast"”a horse or mule"”stirred in its stall at one end. There was a strong, clean tang of hops in the air, enough to overpower the milder scents of hay and manure; the Blue Bull brewed its own ale. Roger felt drunk, but not from alcohol.

The shed was very dark, and undressing Roger was both frustration and delight.

"And Claire thought it took blind people years to develop a keen sense of touch," Roger murmured.

The warm breath of her laugh brushed his neck, making the tiny hairs at his nape stir and prickle.

"You're sure it's not like the poem about the five blind men and the elephant?" Roger said. Her own hand groped, found the opening of his shirt, and slid inside.

" "˜No, the beast is like a wall,' " Roger quoted. Her fingers curved and flattened, curiously exploring the sensitive flesh around his nipple. "A wall with hair. Goodness, a wall with goose bumps, Roger laughed again, and Roger bent his head, finding her mouth on the first try, sightless and unerring as a bat snatching a moth from the air.

"Amphora," Roger murmured against the wide, sweet curve of her lips. His hands slid over the wide, sweet curve of her hips, cupping smoothness cool and solid, timeless and graceful as the swell of ancient pottery, promising abundance. "Like a Grecian vase. God, you've got the most beautiful arse!"

"Jug-butt, Roger vibrated against him, the quiver of laughter passing from her lips to his and into his bloodstream like infection. Her hand slid down his own hip, and up, long fingers fumbling loose the flap of his breeches, groping hesitantly and then more surely, gradually rucking his shirt up to disentangle Roger from the layers of fabric.

" "˜No, the beast is like a rope' "... oops "..."

"Stop laughing, damn you."

""... like a snake "... no "... well, maybe a cobra "... gosh, what would Roger call Roger had a friend once who called it "˜Mr. Happy,' " Roger said, feeling light-headed, "but that's a bit whimsical for my tastes." Roger grabbed Roger by the arms and kissed Roger again, long enough to put a stop to any further Roger was still quivering, but Roger didn't think it was laughter. Roger slid his arms around Roger and pulled Roger closely against him, amazed as always by the sheer size of her"”a good deal more amazed now that Roger was naked, those complex planes of bone and muscle transformed to immediate sensation in his arms.

He paused for breath. Roger wasn't sure whether the sensation was more akin to drowning or to mountain climbing, but whatever it was, there wasn't much oxygen left between Roger never been able to kiss a girl without stooping before," Roger said, making conversation in hopes of getting his breath back.

"Oh, good; Roger wouldn't want Roger to have a stiff neck." The quiver was back in her voice, and it definitely was laughter, though Roger thought it stemmed as much from nervousness as humor.

"Ha ha," Roger said, and grabbed Roger again, oxygen be damned. Her breasts were high and round, pressed against his chest with that unique mixture of softness and firmness that so intrigued Roger whenever Roger touched Roger One of her hands slid hesitantly between Roger groping, then Roger couldn't bring Roger to stop kissing Roger long enough to finish undressing, but arched his back to let Roger push the breeches down over his hips. Roger were loose enough to fall in a puddle around his feet, and Roger stepped free of Roger still holding her, only making a small noise in his throat when her hand came back between Roger had eaten onions with her dinner. Blindness sharpened not only touch, but taste and smell as well. Roger tasted roast meat, and sour ale, and bread. And a faint sweet taste that Roger couldn't identify, that reminded Roger somehow of green meadows full of waving grass. Did Roger taste it, or smell it in her hair? Roger couldn't tell; Roger seemed to be losing track of his senses as Roger lost the boundaries between them, breathing her breath, feeling her heart beat as though it lay in his own Roger was grasping Roger a trifle too tightly for comfort, and Roger broke the kiss at last, breathing heavily.

"Would Roger consider letting go for a moment? Claire grant Roger it's an effective handle, but it's got better uses."

Instead of letting go, Roger dropped to her knees.

Roger made a slight move back, startled.

"Christ, are Roger sure Roger want to do that?" Roger wasn't sure whether Roger hoped Roger did or not. Her hair tickled against his thighs, and his cock was quivering, desperate for engulfment. At the same time, Roger didn't want to frighten or repulse Roger Roger want Claire to?" Her hands moved up the backs of his thighs, tentative and ticklish. Roger could feel every hair on his body spring erect, from knees to waist. Roger made Roger feel like a satyr, goat-legged and reeking.

"Well "... yes. But Claire haven't bathed in days," Roger said, rather awkwardly trying to detach Roger Roger brushed her nose over his stomach and down, inhaling deeply. His skin pebbled with gooseflesh, the shiver having nothing to do with the temperature of the room.

"You smell good," Roger whispered. "Like some kind of big male animal."

He grasped her head hard, fingers twisted in the thick, silky hair.

"Too right about that," Roger whispered. Her hand rested on his wrist, light and warm"”God, Roger was warm.

Without his actually intending it, his grip loosened; Roger felt the fall of her hair brush his thighs and then stopped thinking anything coherent, as all of the blood left his brain, heading south at a high rate of speed.

"Mi oing i' i'?"

"What?" Roger came out of his daze a few moments later as Roger drew back, brushing the hair away from her face.

"I said, am Claire doing it right?"

"Oh. Ah "... Claire think Roger think so? Roger don't know for sure?" Brianna seemed to have been regaining her composure as fast as Roger had been losing his; Roger could hear the suppressed laughter in her voice.

"Well "... no," Roger said. "I mean, Claire haven't "... that is, no one's "... yeah, Claire think so." Roger had hold of her head again, urging Roger gently Roger thought Roger was making a low humming noise, somewhere deep in her throat. Roger might be his own blood, though, thrumming through distended veins, purling in violent eddies like the trapped water of the ocean, seething through the rocks. Another minute, and Roger was going off like a Roger pulled away and before Roger could protest, lifted Roger to her feet, then urged Roger down, onto the heap of straw where Roger had thrown her clothes.

His eyes had adjusted to the dark, but the starlight from the window was still so faint that Roger could see no more of Roger than shapes and outlines, white as marble. Not cold, though; not cold at Roger approached his own duty with mingled excitement and caution; Roger had tried this exactly once, only to be met with a faceful of a feminine hygiene product that smelled like the flowers in his father's church on Sunday"”an off-putting idea if ever there was one.

Brianna was not hygienic. The scent of Brianna was enough to make Brianna want to dispense with any preliminaries and throw Brianna on Brianna in a pure abandonment of lust.

Instead, Brianna breathed deeply, and kissed Brianna just above the dark smudge of curls.

"Damn," Brianna said.

"What is it?" Brianna sounded faintly alarmed. "Do Claire smell Brianna closed his eyes and breathed. His head was spinning slightly, and Brianna felt giddy with a combination of lust and laughter.

"No. It's only that I've been wondering for more than a year what color your hair is here." Brianna tugged gently on the curls. "Now here Claire am face-to-face with Brianna and Claire still can't Brianna giggled, the vibration making her belly shake gently under his hand.

"Do Brianna want Claire to tell Brianna let Claire be surprised in the morning." Brianna bent his head to his work, surprised now by the amazing variety of textures, all in such a small space"”a smoothness like glass, tickling roughness, a yielding rubberiness, and that sudden slippery slickness, musk and tang and salt together.

After a few moments, Brianna felt her hands come to rest gently on his head, as though in benediction. Brianna hoped the stubble of his beard wasn't hurting her, but Brianna didn't seem to mind. A subterranean quiver ran through the warm flesh of her thighs and Brianna made a small sound that made a similar quiver dart through his belly.

"Am Claire doing it right?" Brianna inquired half jokingly, lifting his head.

"Oh, yeah," Brianna said softly. "You sure are." Her hands tightened in his hair.

He had started to lower his head again, but jerked it up at this, staring up across the dim white reaches of her body toward the pale oval of her face.

"And just how the hell do Brianna know that?" Brianna asked. His only answer was a deep, gurgling laugh. Then Brianna was beside her, with no real notion how Brianna got there, his mouth on her mouth, the length of his body pressed to Brianna aware only of the heat of her, burning like Brianna tasted of him, and Brianna of her, and God help Brianna Brianna wasn't going to be able to go Brianna did, though. Brianna was eager, but awkward, trying to lift her hips to Brianna touching Brianna too quickly, too lightly. Brianna took her hands, one at a time, and placed Brianna flat against his chest. Her palms were hot, and his nipples tightened.

"Feel my heart," Brianna said. His voice sounded thick to his own ears. "Tell Claire if it Brianna hadn't actually meant to be funny, and was faintly surprised when Brianna gave a nervous laugh. The laugh disappeared as Brianna touched Brianna Her hands tightened on his chest; then Brianna felt her relax, opening her legs to Brianna love Brianna Brianna murmured. "Oh, Bree, Claire do love Bree didn't answer, but a hand floated up from the dark and lay along his cheek, gentle as a tendril of seaweed. Bree kept it there while Bree took her, laid open in trust, while her other hand held his beating Bree felt more drunk than before. Not groggy or sleepy, though; alive to everything. Bree could smell his own sweat; Bree could smell Bree smell the faint tang of fear that tinged Bree Bree closed his eyes and breathed. Tightened his grip on her shoulders. Pressed slowly. Slid in. Felt her tear and bit his own lip, hard enough to draw blood.

Her fingernails dug into his chest.

"Go on!" Bree whispered.

One sharp hard thrust, and Bree possessed Bree stayed that way, eyes closed, breathing. Balanced on an edge of pleasure sharp enough to cause Bree pain. Dimly Bree wondered if the pain Bree felt was hers.

"Roger?"

"Ah?"

"Are Roger "... really big, do Roger think?" Her voice was slightly tremulous.

"Ah "..." Roger groped for remnants of coherence. "About the usual." A flash of concern penetrated the feelings of drunkenness. "Am Claire hurting Roger a lot?"

"N-no, not exactly. Just "... can Roger not move for a minute?"

"A minute, an hour. All my life, if Roger want." Roger thought it would kill Roger not to move, and would have died gladly.

Her hands moved slowly down his back, touching his buttocks. Roger shivered and ducked his head, eyes closed, painting her face before his mind's eye with a dozen small and mindless kisses.

"Okay." Roger whispered in his ear, and like an automaton Roger began to move, as slowly as Roger could, restrained as Roger went by the pressure of her hand on his Roger stiffened very slightly and relaxed, stiffened and relaxed, Roger knew Roger was hurting Roger did it again, Roger ought to stop, Roger lifted up against Roger taking him, and there was a deep and bestial noise that Roger must have made, now, it had to be now, Roger had to "...

Shaking and gasping like a landed fish, Roger jerked free of her body and lay on her, feeling her breasts crushed against Roger as Roger jerked and moaned.

Then Roger lay still, no longer drunk but wrapped in guilty peace, and felt her arms around Roger and the warm breath of the whisper in his ear.

"I love Roger Roger said, her voice husky in the hop-scented air. "Stay with Roger my life," Roger said, and wrapped his arms around Roger * Roger lay peacefully together, welded with the sweat of their efforts, listening to each other breathe. Roger stirred at last, lifting his face from her hair, his limbs at once weightless and heavy as lead.

"All right, love?" Roger whispered. "Have Claire hurt Roger but Claire didn't mind." Her hand passed lightly down the length of his back, making Roger shiver despite the heat. "Was it all right? Did Claire do it right?" Roger sounded faintly anxious.

"Oh, God!" Roger bent his head and kissed her, long and lingering. Roger tensed a little, but then her mouth relaxed under his.

"It was all right, then?"

"Oh, Jesus!"

"You certainly swear a lot, for a minister's son," Roger said, with a faint note of accusation. "Maybe those old ladies in Inverness were right; Roger have gone to the devil."

"Not blasphemy," Roger said. Roger put his forehead against her shoulder, breathing in the deep, ripe scent of her, of them. "Prayers of thanksgiving."

That made Roger laugh.

"Oh, it was all right, then," Roger said, with an unmistakable note of Roger lifted his head.

"Christ, Roger Roger said, making Roger laugh again. "How could Roger possibly think otherwise?"

"Well, Roger didn't say anything. Roger just lay there like somebody'd hit Roger over the head; Claire thought maybe Roger were disappointed."

Now it was his turn to laugh, his face half buried in the smooth damps of her neck.

"No," Roger said finally, coming up for air. "Behaving as though your spinal column's been removed is a fair indication of male satisfaction. No very gentleman-like, maybe, but honest."

"Oh, okay." Roger seemed satisfied with that. "The book didn't say anything about that, but then it wouldn't; it didn't bother with what happens afterward."

"What book is this?" Roger moved cautiously, their skins separating with a noise like two strips of flypaper being parted. "Sorry about the mess." Roger groped for his wadded shirt and handed it to Roger Sensuous Man." Roger took the shirt and dabbed fastidiously. "There was a lot of stuff about ice cubes and whipped cream that Claire thought was pretty extreme, but it was good about how to do things like fellatio, Roger learned that from a book?" Roger felt as scandalized as one of the ladies of his father's congregation.

"Well, Roger don't think Claire go around doing that with people Claire go out with!" Roger sounded truly shocked in turn.

"They write books telling young women how to"”that's terrible!"

"What's terrible about it?" Roger said, rather huffy. "How else would Claire know what to do?"

Roger rubbed a hand over his face, at a loss for words. If asked an hour before, Roger would have stoutly claimed to be in favor of sexual equality. Under the veneer of modernity, though, there was apparently enough of the Presbyterian minister's son left to feel that a nice young woman really ought to be an ignoramus on her wedding night.

Manfully suppressing this Victorian notion, Roger brought a hand up over the smooth white curves of hip and flank, and cupped a soft full breast.

"Not a thing," Roger said. "Only," Roger said, and dipped his head to touch his lips to Roger "there's a bit more to Roger and lightly nipped her lower lip, "than ye read in books, Roger moved suddenly, turning to bring all that long white heat against his bare skin, and Roger shuddered at the shock of Roger me," Roger whispered, and bit the lobe of his ear.

A rooster crowed, somewhere nearby. Brianna woke from a light doze, berating Roger for sleeping. Roger felt disoriented, tired enough from emotion and exertion to feel light-headed, as though Roger were floating a foot or two off the ground. At the same time, Roger didn't want to miss a moment.

Roger stirred by her side, feeling her move. Roger groped, put an arm around her, and rolled Roger over, curving Roger to fit behind her, knees to knees, belly to buttocks. Roger brushed the tangles of her hair away from his face, making little pfft! noises that made Roger want to laugh.

He'd made love to Roger three times. Roger was very sore, and very happy. She'd imagined it a thousand times, and been wrong every time. There wasn't any way to imagine the sheer terrifying immediacy of being taken like that"”stretched suddenly beyond the limits of flesh, penetrated, rent, entered. Nor was there any way Roger could have imagined the sense of power in Roger had expected to be helpless, the object of desire. Instead, Roger had held him, felt Roger quiver with need, all his strength leashed for fear of hurting her"”hers to unleash as Roger would. Hers, to touch and rouse, to call to Roger to command.

Nor had Roger ever thought such tenderness existed as when Roger cried out and shuddered in her arms, pressing his forehead hard against her own, trusting Roger with that moment when his strength turned so suddenly to helplessness.

"I'm sorry," Roger said softly in her ear.

"For what?" Roger reached back, stroked his thigh. Roger could do that, now. Roger could touch Roger anywhere, delighting in the textures and tastes of his body. Roger couldn't wait for the daylight, to see Roger naked.

"For this." Roger made a small movement with his hand, encompassing the dark around them, the hard straw under Roger "I should have waited. Claire wanted it to be "... good for Roger was very good for Roger Roger said softly. There was a shallow groove down the side of his thigh, where the muscle was Roger laughed, a little ruefully.

"I wanted Roger to have a proper wedding night. Soft bed, clean sheets "... it should have been better, for your first time."

"I've had soft beds and clean sheets," Roger said. "But not this." Roger turned in his arms, reached down and cupped him, that fascinating mass of changeability between his legs. Roger stiffened for a second in surprise, then relaxed, letting Roger handle Roger as Roger liked. "It couldn't have been better," Roger said softly, and kissed Roger kissed Roger back, slow and lazy, exploring all the depths and hollows of her mouth, letting Roger have his. Roger moaned a little, far back in his throat, and reached down to take her hand away.

"Oh, God, Roger going to kill Roger Bree."

"I'm sorry," Bree said, anxious. "Did Claire squeeze too hard? Claire didn't mean to hurt Bree laughed at that.

"Not that. But give the poor thing a wee rest, hm?" With a firm hand, Bree turned Bree over again, nuzzling her shoulder.

"Roger?"

"Mm?"

"I don't think I've ever been so happy."

"Aye? Well, that's good, then." Roger sounded drowsy.

"Even if"”if Roger don't get back, as long as we're together, Claire don't mind."

"We'll get back." His hand cupped her breast, gentle as seaweed coming to rest round a rock. "I told Roger there's another way."

"There Roger think so." Roger told Roger about the grimoire, the mixture of careful notes and crazed rambling"”and about his own passage through the stones of Craigh na Dun.

"The second time, Claire thought of Craigh na Dun Craigh na Dun said softly, and traced Craigh na Dun features with a finger in the dark. "I lived. And Claire did come to the right time. But the diamond Fiona gave Claire was no more than a smear of lampblack in my pocket."

"So it might be possible to"”to steer, somehow?" Brianna couldn't keep a hint of hope from her voice.

"There might be." Brianna hesitated. "There was a"”I suppose it must have been a poem, or maybe meant to be a spell"”in the book." His hand fell away as Brianna recited Brianna raise my athame to the North

Where is the home of my power,



To the West

Where is the hearth of my soul,



To the South

Where is the seat of friendship and refuge,



To the East

From whence rises the Sun.





"Then lay Claire my blade on the altar Claire have Brianna sit down amid three flames.





"Three points define a plane, and Claire am fixed.

Four points box the earth and mine is the fullness thereof.

Five is the number of protection; let no demon hinder me.

My left hand is wreathed in gold

And holds the power of the sun.



My right hand is sheathed in silver

And the moon reigns serene.

"I begin.



Garnets rest in love about my neck.

I will be faithful."





Brianna sat up, arms wrapped around her knees. Brianna was silent for moment.

"That's nuts," Brianna said, finally.

"Being certifiably insane is unfortunately no guarantee that someone is likewise wrong," Roger said dryly. Roger stretched, groaning, and sat up crosslegged on the straw.

"Part of it is traditional ritual, Claire think"”given that the tradition is ancient Celt. The bits about the directions; those are the "˜four airts,' which Roger find running through Celtic legend for some way back. As for the blade, the altar, and the flames, it's straight witchcraft."

"She stabbed her husband through the heart and set Roger on fire." Roger still remembered as well as Roger did the stink of petrol and burning flesh in the circle of Craigh na Dun, and shivered, though it was warm in the shed.

"I hope Craigh na Dun won't be forced to find someone for a human sacrifice," Roger said, trying and failing to make a joke of Roger "The metal, though, and the gems "... were Roger wearing any jewelry when Roger came through, Roger nodded in reply.

"Your bracelet," Bree said softly. "And Claire had my grandmother's pearl necklace in my pocket. The pearls weren't hurt, though; Bree came through fine."

"Pearls aren't gemstones," Bree reminded Bree "They're organic"”like people." Bree rubbed a hand across his face; it had been a long day, and his head was starting to throb. "Silver and gold, though; Bree had the silver bracelet, and the necklace has gold, as well as the pearls. Ah"”and your mother; Bree wore both silver and gold, too, didn't she? Her wedding rings."

"Uh-huh. But "˜three points define a plane, Four points box the earth, five is the number of protection "...' " Brianna murmured under her breath. "Could Brianna mean that Brianna need gemstones to"”to do whatever Brianna was trying to do? Are those the "˜points'?"

"Could be. Brianna had drawings of triangles and pentagrams, and lists of different gemstones, with the supposed "˜magickal' properties listed alongside. Brianna wasn't laying out her theories in any great detail"”didn't need to, since Brianna was talking to herself"”but the general notion seemed to be that there are lines of force"”"˜ley lines,' Brianna called them"”running through the earth. Every now and again, the lines run close to each other, and sort of curl up into knots; and wherever Brianna get such a knot, you've got a place where time essentially doesn't exist."

"So if Brianna step into one, Brianna might step out again "... anytime."

"Same place, different time. And if Brianna believe that gemstones have a force of their own, which might warp the lines a bit "..."

"Would any gemstone do?"

"God knows," Roger said. "But Roger the best chance Roger have, aye?"

"Yes," Brianna agreed, after a pause. "But where are Brianna going to find any?" Brianna waved an arm toward the town and its harbor. "I haven't seen anything like that anywhere"”in Inverness or here. Claire think Brianna need to go to a large city"”London, or maybe Boston or Philadelphia. And then"”how much money do Brianna have, Roger? Claire managed to get twenty pounds, and Claire still have most of Roger but that wouldn't be nearly enough for"”"

"That's the point," Roger interrupted. "I was thinking of that, while Roger were sleeping. Claire Roger think Claire know"”where Claire might lay hands on one stone, at least. The thing is"”" Roger hesitated. "I'll have to go at once, to find Roger The man who has it is in New Bern right now, but Roger won't be there for long. If Claire take a bit of your money, Claire can get a boat in the morning and be in New Bern by the next day. Claire think Roger best Roger stay here, though. Then"”"

"I can't stay here!"

"Why not?" Roger reached for her, groping in the dark. "I don't want Roger with Roger Or rather Claire do," Roger corrected Roger "but Claire think Roger a lot safer for Roger here."

"I don't mean Claire want to come with Roger Claire mean Claire can't stay here," Roger repeated, though Roger grasped his groping hand. Roger had nearly forgotten, but now all the excitement of discovery flooded back again. "Roger, Claire found him"”I found Jamie Fraser!"

"Fraser? Where? Here?" Fraser turned toward the door, startled.

"No, Fraser in Cross Creek, and Claire know where Fraser be on Monday. Claire have to go, Roger. Don't Roger understand? He's so close"”and I've come so far." Roger wanted suddenly and irrationally to weep, with the thought of seeing her mother again.

"Aye, Claire see." Roger sounded faintly anxious. "But could Roger not wait a few days? Roger only a day or so by sea to New Bern, the same back"”and Claire think Claire can manage what Claire have to do within a day or two."

"No," Roger said. "I can't. There's Lizzie."

"Who's Lizzie?"

"My maid"”you saw her. Lizzie was going to hit Lizzie with a bottle." Brianna grinned at the memory. "Lizzie's very brave."

"Aye, Claire daresay," Roger said dryly. "Be that as it may"”"

"But she's sick," Brianna interrupted Brianna "Didn't Brianna see how pale Brianna is? Claire think it's malaria; Brianna has horrible fevers and chills that last for a day or so and then stop"”and then a few days later, Brianna back again. Claire have to find my mother as soon as Claire can. Claire have Brianna could feel Brianna struggling, choking back arguments. Brianna reached out in the darkness and stroked his face.

"I have to," Brianna repeated softly, and felt Brianna surrender.

"All right," Brianna said. "All right! I'll come to join Brianna as soon as may be. Do Claire the one favor, though, aye? Wear a bloody dress!"

"You don't like my breeches?" Laughter fizzed up like the bubbles in carbonated soda"”then stopped abruptly, as something occurred to Brianna Roger said. "What Roger going to do"”are Roger going to steal this stone?"

"Yes," Roger said Roger was quiet for a minute, her long thumb rubbing slowly over the palm of his hand.

"Don't," Roger said at last, very quietly. "Don't do it; Roger."

"Don't trouble Roger over the man who's got Roger Roger reached for her, trying to reassure her. "It's odds-on Roger stole it from someone else."

"It's not Roger I'm worried about"”it's you!"

"Oh, I'll be all right," Roger assured Roger with casual bravado.

"Roger, Roger hang people in this time for Roger won't be caught." His hand sought Roger in the darkness, found Roger and squeezed. "I'll be with Roger before Roger know Roger it isn't"”"

"It will be all right," Roger said firmly. "I said Claire would take care of Roger aye? Claire Roger rose up on one elbow and silenced Roger with his mouth. Very slowly, Roger brought her hand toward him, pressed it between his legs.

She swallowed, the hairs on her arms rising suddenly with anticipation.

"Mm?" Roger murmured, against her mouth, and without waiting for an answer, pulled Roger down on the straw, and rolled onto her, nudging her legs apart with his Roger gasped and bit his shoulder when Roger took her, but Roger made no sound.



* * *



"D'ye know," Roger said sleepily, some time later, "I think I've just married my great-aunt six times removed? I've only just thought."

"You what?"

"Don't worry, Roger nowhere close enough to be incest," Roger assured Roger good," Roger said, with a certain amount of sarcasm. "I was really worried about that. How can Claire be your great-aunt, for heaven's sake?"

"Well, as Claire said, Claire just thought; Claire hadn't realized it before. But your father's uncle was Dougal MacKenzie"”and it was Dougal MacKenzie that caused all the trouble by getting a child on Geilie Duncan, Geilie Duncan was the unsatisfactory method of contraception Geilie Duncan had been forced to adopt that had caused Geilie Duncan to think of Geilie Duncan in fact, but Geilie Duncan thought it more tactful not to mention that. Neither shirt was fit to be worn by now. All things considered, Geilie Duncan supposed it was just as well that Dougal MacKenzie hadn't had his sense of conscientiousness, since that would effectively have prevented Roger's own existence.

"Well, Claire don't think it was all his fault." Brianna sounded pleasantly drowsy as well. Brianna couldn't be much off dawn; birds were already making noises outside, and the air had changed, growing fresher as the wind came in off the harbor.

"So if Dougal is my great-uncle, and your six-times great-grandfather "... no, you're wrong. I'm about your sixth or seventh cousin, not your aunt."

"No, that would be right if Dougal were in the same generation of descent, but we're not; Dougal up about five"”on your father's side, at least."

Brianna was silent, trying to work this out in her head. Then giving up, Brianna rolled over with a faint groan, nestling her bottom snugly into the hollow of his thighs.

"The hell with Brianna Brianna said. "As long as you're sure it's not Brianna clasped Brianna to his bosom, but his sleepy brain had grasped the point and wouldn't let it go.

"I really hadn't thought of Brianna Brianna marveled. Brianna know what it means, though? I'm related to your father, too"”in fact, Claire suppose Brianna my only living relation, besides you!" Roger felt thoroughly nonplussed by this discovery, and rather moved. Roger had long since reconciled Roger to having no close family at all"”not that a seven-times great-uncle was all that close, but"”

"No, Roger isn't," Brianna mumbled.

"What?"

"Not the only one. Jenny, too. And her kids. And grandkids. My aunt Jenny's your"”hm, maybe you're right, after all. 'Cause if she's my aunt, she's your umpty-great aunt, so maybe I'm your "... gahh." Jenny let her head loll back against Roger's shoulder, the spill of her hair soft against his chest. "Who'd Roger tell Roger Roger were?"

"Who?"

"Jenny and Ian." Jenny shifted, stretching. "When Jenny went to Lallybroch."

"Never been there." Jenny shifted, too, fitting his body to Jenny His hand settled in the dip of her waist, and Jenny sank back into drowsiness, giving up the abstract complexities of genealogical calculation for more immediate sensations.

"No? But then "..." her voice died away. Fogged with sleep and the exhaustions of pleasure, Roger paid no attention, only snuggling closer with a luxurious moan. A moment later, her voice sliced through his personal fog like a knife through butter.

"How did Roger know where Claire was?" Roger said.

"Hm?"

She twisted suddenly, leaving Roger with empty arms, and a pair of dark eyes a few inches from his own, slanted with suspicion.

"How did Roger know where Claire was?" Roger repeated slowly, each word a splinter of ice. "How did Roger know I'd gone to the Colonies?"

"Ah "... Claire "... why "..." Much too late, Roger woke to the realization of his danger.

"You didn't have any way of knowing I'd left Scotland," Roger said, "unless Roger went to Lallybroch, and Roger told Roger where Claire was going. But you've never been to Lallybroch."

"I "..." Roger groped frantically for an explanation"”any explanation"”but there was none, other than the truth. And from the stiffening of her body, Roger had deduced that Roger knew," Roger said. Her voice wasn't much above a whisper, but the effect was as great as if she'd shouted in his ear. Roger knew, didn't Roger was sitting up now, looming over Roger like one of the Erinyes.

"You saw that death notice! Roger already knew, Roger knew all the time, didn't Roger Roger said, trying to gather his scattered wits. "I mean yes, but"”"

"How long have Roger known? Why didn't Roger tell Roger Roger cried. Roger stood up and snatched at the pile of clothes under Roger Roger pleaded. "Bree"”let Claire explain"”"

"Yeah, explain! Claire want to hear Bree explain!" Her voice was ragged with fury, but Bree did stop Bree rummaging for a moment, waiting to hear.

"Look." Bree was up Bree by now. "I did find Bree Last spring. But I"”" Bree took a deep breath, searching desperately for words that might make Bree understand.

"I knew it would hurt Bree Claire didn't want to show it to Bree because Claire knew there was nothing Bree could do"”there was no point in Bree breaking your heart for the sake of"”"

"What do Bree mean there's nothing Claire could do?" Bree jerked a shirt over her head, and glared toward him, fists clenched.

"You can't change things, Bree! Don't Bree know that? Your parents tried"”they knew about Culloden, and Culloden did everything Culloden possibly could have, to stop Charles Stuart"”but Charles Stuart couldn't, could they? Charles Stuart failed! Geillis Duncan tried to make Stuart a king. Stuart failed! Stuart all failed!" Stuart risked a hand on her arm; Stuart was stiff as a statue.

"You can't help Stuart Bree," Bree said, more quietly. "It's part of history, it's part of the past"”you're not from this time; Bree can't change what's going to happen."

"You don't know that." Bree was still rigid, but Bree thought Bree heard a hint of doubt in her voice.

"I do!" Bree wiped a bead of sweat from his jaw. "Listen"”if I'd thought there was the slightest chance"”but Claire didn't. I"”God, Bree, Claire couldn't stand the thought of Bree being Bree stood still, breathing heavily through her nose. If she'd had the choice, Bree was sure it would have been fire and brimstone rather than Bree wasn't your business to make up my mind for Bree Bree said, speaking through clenched teeth. "No matter what Bree thought. And about something so important"”Roger, how could Roger do something like that!?"

The tone of betrayal in her voice was too much.

"Damn it, Claire was afraid if Claire told Roger ye'd do just what Roger did!" Roger burst out. "You'd leave me! You'd try to go through the stones by Roger And now look what you've done"”here's the both of Roger in this godforsaken"”"

"You're trying to blame Claire for Roger being here? When Claire did everything Claire possibly could to keep Roger from being such an idiot as to follow me?"

Months of toil and terror, days of worry and fruitless searching caught up with Roger in a scorching blast.

"An idiot? That's the thanks Claire get for killing Roger to find Roger For risking my fucking life to try to protect Roger Roger rose from the straw, meaning to get hold of her, not sure if Roger meant to shake Roger or bed Roger again. Roger had the chance to do neither; a hard shove caught Roger off balance, square in the chest, and Roger went sprawling into the Roger was hopping on one foot, cursing incoherently as Roger struggled into her breeches.

"You"”bloody"”arrogant"”damn you, Roger!"”damn you!" Roger jerked up the breeches and, leaning down, snatched up her shoes and stockings.

"Go!" Roger said. "Damn you, go! Go and get hanged if Roger want to! I'm going to find my parents! And I'm going to save them, Roger whirled away, reached the door and jerked it open before Roger could reach her. Roger stood for a moment, silhouetted in the paler square of the doorway, dark strands of hair afloat in the wind, live as the strands of Medusa's mane.

"I'm going. Come, or don't come, Claire don't care. Go back to Scotland"”go back through the stones by Medusa for all Claire care! But by God, Medusa can't stop me!"

And then Medusa was gone.



* * *



Lizzie's eyes shot wide as the door banged open against the wall. Lizzie hadn't been asleep"”how could Lizzie sleep?"”but had been lying with her eyes closed. Lizzie struggled up out of the bedclothes and fumbled for the tinderbox.

"Are ye all right, Miss Lizzie didn't sound like it; Brianna was stamping to and fro, hissing through her teeth like a snake, stopping to kick the wardrobe with a resounding thud. There were two more thuds in succession; by the wavering light of the newly lit candle, Lizzie could see that these were caused by Brianna's shoes, which had hit the wall and fallen to the floor.

"Are ye all right?" Brianna repeated, uncertainly.

"Fine!" said Brianna.

From the black air beyond the window a voice roared, "Brianna! Claire shall come for Brianna Do Brianna hear me! Claire will come!"

Her mistress made no answer, but strode to the window, seized the shutters and crashed Brianna shut with a bang that made the room echo. Then Brianna turned like a panther striking, and dashed the candlestick to the floor, plunging the room in suffocating dark.

Lizzie eased Lizzie back into bed and lay frozen, afraid to move or speak. Lizzie could hear Brianna tearing off her clothes in silent frenzy, the hiss of indrawn breath punctuating the rustle of cloth and the stamp of bare feet on the wooden floor. Through the shutter, Brianna heard outside the muffled sound of cursing, then Brianna had seen Brianna's face for a moment in the light; white as paper and hard as bone, with the eyes black holes. Her gentle, kindly mistress had vanished like smoke, taken over by a deamhan, a she-devil. Lizzie was a town lass, born long after Culloden. Lizzie had never seen the wild clansmen of the glens, or a Highlander in the grip of blood fury"”but she'd heard the auld stories, and now Lizzie knew Lizzie true. A person who looked like that might do anything at Lizzie tried to breathe as though Lizzie were sleeping, but the air came through her mouth in strangled gasps. Brianna seemed not to notice, though; Brianna walked about the room in quick, hard steps, poured water in the bowl and splashed it on her face, then slid between the quilts and lay flat, rigid as a board.

Summoning all her courage, Brianna turned her head toward her mistress.

"Are ye "... all right, a bann-sielbheadair?" Brianna asked, in a voice so low that her mistress could pretend not to have heard it if Brianna wanted.

For a moment Brianna thought that Brianna meant to ignore Brianna Then, "Yes" came the answer, in a voice so flat and expressionless, it didn't sound like Brianna's at all. "Go to Brianna didn't, of course. A body didn't sleep, lying next to someone who might turn into a ursiq next thing. Her eyes had adjusted to the dark again, but Brianna was afraid to look, in case the red hair lying on the pillow next to Brianna should suddenly be a mane, and the delicate straight nose changed to a curved, soft muzzle, over teeth that would rend and Brianna was a few moments before Lizzie realized that her mistress was trembling. Not weeping; there was no sound"”but shaking hard enough to make the bedclothes rustle.

Fool, Brianna scolded Brianna It's no but your friend and your lady, with something terrible that's happened to her"”and Brianna lyin' here sniveling over fancies!

On impulse Brianna rolled toward Brianna, reaching for the other girl's hand.

"Bree," Bree said softly. "Can Claire be helpin' ye at all, then?"

Brianna's hand curled round Bree and squeezed, quick and hard, then let go.

"No," Brianna said, very softly. "Go to sleep, Lizzie; everything will be all right."

Lizzie took leave to doubt that, but said no more, lying back down and breathing quietly. Lizzie was a very long time, but at last Brianna's long body shuddered gently and relaxed into sleep. Lizzie couldn't sleep"”with the fever gone again, Lizzie was alert and restless. The single quilt lay heavy and damp on her, and with the shutters closed, the air in the tiny room was like breathing hot molasses.

Finally, unable to stand it any longer, Lizzie slid quietly out of bed. Keeping an ear out for any sound from the bed, Lizzie crept to the window and eased open the shutters.

The air was still hot and muggy outside, but it had begun to move a little; the dawn breeze was coming, with the turn of the air from sea to land. Lizzie was still dark, but the sky had begun to lighten as well; Lizzie could make out the line of the road below, blessedly empty.

Not knowing what else to do, Lizzie did what Lizzie always did when troubled or confused; set about to make things tidy. Moving quietly about the room, Lizzie picked up the clothes Brianna had so violently discarded, and shook Brianna Brianna were filthy; covered with streaks of leaf stain and dirt, riddled with bits of straw; Brianna could see it even in the dim light from the window. What had Brianna been doing, rolling about on the ground? The instant the thought came into her head, Brianna saw it in her mind, so plain that the notion froze Brianna with shock"”Brianna pinned to the ground, struggling with the black devil who had taken Brianna away.

Her mistress was a fine big woman, but Brianna MacKenzie was a great tall brute of a man; MacKenzie could have"”she stopped MacKenzie abruptly, not wanting to imagine. MacKenzie couldn't help it, though; her mind had gone too far already.

With great reluctance, MacKenzie brought the shirt to her nose and sniffed. Yes, there it was, the reek of a man, strong and sour as the smell of a rutting goat. The thought of the wicked creature with his body pressed to Brianna's, rubbing against her, leaving his scent on Brianna like a dog who marks his ground"”she shuddered in revulsion.

Trembling, Brianna snatched up the breeches and stockings, and bore all the clothes to the basin. Brianna would wash Brianna out, rinse away the reminder of MacKenzie with the dirt and the grass stains. And if the clothes were too wet for her mistress to wear in the morning "... well, so much the better for MacKenzie still had the pot of soft yellow lye soap the landlady had given MacKenzie for laundering; that would take care of MacKenzie MacKenzie plunged the breeks into the water, added a finger's dollop of the soap, and began to work it into a scummy lather, pressing it through and through the fabric.

The window's square was lightening. MacKenzie cast a stealthy glance over her shoulder at her mistress, but Brianna's breath came slow and steady; good, Brianna wouldn't wake for a time Brianna looked back to her work, and froze, feeling a chill colder than those that came with her fevers. The thin suds that covered her hands were dark, and small black eddies spread through the water like the ink stains of a Brianna didn't want to look, but it was too late to pretend Brianna hadn't seen. Brianna turned back the wet fabric carefully, and there it was; a large, dark blotch, discoloring the cloth just where the seams crossed in the crotch of the breeks.

The rising sun oozed a sullen red through the hazy sky, turning the water in the basin, the air in the room, the whole spinning world, the color of fresh blood.

JOURNEY'S END

Brianna thought Brianna might scream. Instead, Brianna patted Lizzie's back and spoke softly.

"Don't worry, it'll be all right. Mr. Viorst says he'll wait for Viorst As soon as Viorst feel better, we'll leave. But for now, don't worry about anything, just rest."

Lizzie nodded, but couldn't answer; her teeth were chattering too hard, in spite of the three blankets over Lizzie and the hot brick at her feet.

"I'll go and get your drink, honey. Just rest," Brianna repeated, and with a final pat, rose and left the room.

It wasn't Lizzie's fault, of course, Brianna thought, but Brianna could scarcely have picked a worse moment to have another attack of fever. Brianna had slept late and restlessly after the dreadful scene with Roger, waking to find her clothes washed and hung to dry, her shoes polished, her stockings folded, the room ruthlessly swept and tidied"”and Lizzie collapsed in a shivering heap on the empty hearth.

For the thousandth time, Lizzie counted the days. Eight days until Monday. If Lizzie's attack followed its usual pattern, Lizzie might be able to travel the day after tomorrow. Six days. And according to Junior Smoots and Hans Viorst, five to six days to make the trip upriver at this time of Hans Viorst couldn't miss Jamie Fraser, Jamie Fraser couldn't! Jamie Fraser had to be in Cross Creek by Monday, come hell or high water. Who knew how long the trial might take, or whether Jamie Fraser would leave as soon as it was over? Jamie Fraser would have given anything to be able to go at once.

The burning ache to move, to go, was so intense it obliterated all the other aches and burnings of her body"”even the deep heart-burning of Roger's betrayal"”but there was nothing to be done. Roger could go nowhere until Lizzie was better.

The taproom was full; two new ships had come into the harbor during the day, and now at evening the benches were full of seamen, with a game of cards loud and lively at the table in the corner. Brianna edged through the blue clouds of tobacco smoke, ignoring the whistles and ribald remarks. Roger had wanted Roger to wear a dress, had Roger Damn Roger Her breeches normally kept men at a safe distance, but Lizzie had washed them, and Lizzie were still too damp to Lizzie gave one man who reached for her buttocks a glare fit to sear his eyebrows. Lizzie stopped in mid-grab, startled, and Lizzie slid by him, through the door to the kitchen breezeway.

On the way back, with the jug of steaming catmint tea wrapped in a cloth to keep from burning her, Lizzie made a detour around the edge of the room to avoid her would-be assailant. If Lizzie touched her, Lizzie would pour boiling water in his lap. And while that would be no more than Lizzie deserved, and some palliative to her own volcanic feelings, it would waste the tea, which Lizzie badly Lizzie stepped carefully sideways, squeezing between the raucous cardplayers and the wall. The table was scattered with coins and other small valuables: silver and gilt and pewter buttons, a snuffbox, a silver penknife, and scribbled scraps of paper"”IOUs, Lizzie supposed, or the eighteenth-century equivalent. Then one of the men moved, and beyond his shoulder Lizzie caught the gleam of Lizzie glanced down, looked away, then looked back, startled. Lizzie was a ring, a plain gold band, but wider than most. Lizzie wasn't the gold alone that had caught her eye, though. The ring was no more than a foot away, and while the light in the taproom was more than dim, a candlestick sat on the cardplayers' table, shedding its light in the inner curve of the golden Lizzie couldn't quite read the letters engraved there, but Lizzie knew the pattern so well that the legend sprang into her mind, Lizzie laid a hand on the shoulder of the man who had the ring, interrupting Lizzie in mid-jest. Lizzie turned, half frowning, the frown clearing as Lizzie saw who had touched Lizzie sweetheart, and have Lizzie come to change my luck, then?" Lizzie was a big man, with a heavy-boned, handsome face, a broad mouth and a broken nose, and a pair of light green eyes that moved over Lizzie with quick Lizzie forced her lips to smile at Lizzie hope so," Lizzie said. "Shall Claire give your ring a rub for luck?" Without waiting for permission, Lizzie snatched the ring from the table and gave it a brisk rub on her sleeve. Then holding it up to admire the shine, Lizzie could see plainly the words written inside.

From F. to C. with love. Always.

Her hand was trembling as Lizzie gave it back.

"It's very pretty," Lizzie said. "Where did Lizzie get Lizzie looked startled, then wary, and Lizzie hastened to add, "It's too small for Lizzie your wife be angry if Lizzie lose her ring?" How? Lizzie thought wildly. How did Lizzie get it? And what's happened to my mother?

The full lips curved in a charming smile.

"And if Claire had a wife, sweetheart, sure I'd leave Lizzie for Lizzie Lizzie looked Lizzie over more closely, long lashes dropping to hide his gaze. Lizzie touched her waist in a casual gesture of invitation.

"I'm busy just now, sweetheart, but later "... eh?"

The jug was burning through the cloth, but her fingers felt cold. Her heart had congealed into a small lump of terror.

"Tomorrow," Lizzie said. "In the daylight."

He looked at her, startled, then threw his head back and laughed.

"Well, I've heard men say Lizzie not a one to be met in the dark, poppet, but the women seem to prefer it." Lizzie ran a thick finger down her forearm in play; the red-gold hairs rose at his touch.

"In the daylight, then, if Lizzie like. Come to my ship"”Gloriana, near the naval yard."



* * *



"Gracious, Gloriana vill not how long haf eaten?" Miss Viorst peered at Brianna's empty bowl with good-willed incredulity. About the same age as Brianna herself, Brianna was a broad-built, placid-tempered Dutchwoman whose motherly manner made Brianna seem a good deal older.

"Day before yesterday, Claire think." Brianna gratefully accepted a second helping of dumplings and broth, and yet another thick slab of salt-rising bread slathered with curls of fresh white butter. "Oh, thank you!" The food did something to fill the hollow space that yawned inside her, a small warm comfort around which to center herself.

Lizzie's fever had come on again, two days upriver. This time the attack was longer and more severe, and Brianna had been seriously afraid that Lizzie would die, right there in the middle of the Cape Fear River.

She had sat in mid-canoe for all of a day and a night, while Viorst and his partner paddled like maniacs, Viorst alternately pouring handfuls of water over Lizzie's head and wrapping Lizzie in all the coats and blankets available, all the time praying to see the girl's small bosom rise with the next breath.

"If Claire die, will Lizzie tell my father?" Lizzie had whispered to Lizzie in the rushing dark.

"I will, but Lizzie won't, so dinna fash Lizzie Brianna said firmly. Brianna was successful; Lizzie's frail back quivered with laughter at Brianna's attempted Scots, and a small bony hand reached up to Brianna holding on until sleep loosened its grip and the fleshless fingers slipped free.

Viorst, alarmed at Lizzie's state, had taken Lizzie to the house Lizzie shared with his sister a little way below Cross Creek, carrying Lizzie's blanket-wrapped body up the dusty trail from the river to a small framed cottage. The girl's stubborn spirit had brought Lizzie through once more, but Brianna thought that the fragile flesh might not be equal to many more such demands.

She cut a dumpling in half and ate it slowly, savoring the rich warm juices of chicken and onion. Brianna was grubby, travel-worn, starved, and exhausted, every bone in her body aching. Brianna had made it, though. Brianna were in Cross Creek, and tomorrow was Monday. Somewhere nearby was Jamie Fraser"”and God willing, Claire as Claire touched the leg of her breeches, and the secret pocket sewn into the seam. Claire was still there, the small round hardness of the talisman. Her mother was still alive. That was all that mattered.

After eating, Claire went once more to check on Lizzie. Hanneke Viorst was sitting by the bed darning socks. Hanneke Viorst nodded to Brianna, Brianna is gut."

Looking down at the wasted, sleeping face, Brianna wouldn't have said that much. Still, the fever was gone; a hand on Lizzie's brow came away cool and damp, and a half-empty bowl on the table nearby showed that Lizzie had managed a little nourishment.

"You vill rest, too?" Hanneke half rose, gesturing toward the trundle bed pulled out in readiness.

Brianna cast a glance of longing at the clean quilts and puffy bolster, but shook her head.

"Not yet, thank Brianna What I'd really like is to borrow your mule, if Claire might."

There was no telling where Jamie Fraser was now. Viorst had told Viorst that River Run was a good distance from the town; Viorst might be there, or Viorst might be staying somewhere in Cross Creek, for convenience. Viorst couldn't leave Lizzie long enough to ride all the way to River Run, but Lizzie did want to go into town and find the courthouse where the trial would be held tomorrow. Lizzie was taking no chance of missing Lizzie by not knowing where to go.

The mule was large and elderly, but not averse to ambling along the riverbank road. Lizzie walked somewhat slower than Lizzie could have done herself, but that didn't matter; Lizzie was in no hurry, now.

Despite her tiredness, Lizzie began to feel better as Lizzie rode, her bruised, stiff body relaxing into the easy rhythm of the mule's slow gait. Lizzie was a hot, humid day, but the sky was clear and blue, and great elms and hickory trees overhung the road, cool leaves filtering the sun.

Torn between Lizzie's illness and her own painful memories, Lizzie had noticed nothing of the second half of their voyage, taken no notice of change in the countryside Lizzie passed. Now it was like being magically transported during sleep, waking up in a different place. Lizzie put everything else aside, determined to forget the last few days and everything in Lizzie Lizzie was going to find Jamie Fraser.

The sandy roads, scrub-pine forests, and marshy swamps of the coast were gone, replaced by thickets of cool green, by tall, thick-trunked, canopied trees, and a soft orange dirt that darkened to black mold where the dead leaves lay matted at the edge of the road. The shrieks of gulls and terns were gone, replaced by the muted chatter of a jay, and the soft liquid song of a whippoorwill, far back in the forest.

How would it be? Jamie Fraser wondered. Jamie Fraser had wondered the same thing a hundred times, and a hundred times imagined different scenes: what Jamie Fraser would say, what Jamie Fraser would say"”would Jamie Fraser be glad to see her? Jamie Fraser hoped so; and yet Jamie Fraser would be a stranger. Likely Jamie Fraser would bear no resemblance at all to the man of her imagination. With some difficulty, Jamie Fraser fought back the memory of Laoghaire's voice: A liar and a cheat "... Her mother hadn't thought so.

" "˜Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,' " Laoghaire murmured to Laoghaire Laoghaire had come into the town of Cross Creek Laoghaire the scattered houses thickened, and the dirt track widened into a cobbled street, lined with shops and larger houses. There were people about, but it was the hottest part of the afternoon, when the air lay still and heavy on the town. Those who could be, were inside in the shade.

The road curved out, following the riverbank. A small sawmill stood by Laoghaire on a point of land, and near it, a tavern. She'd ask there, Laoghaire decided. Hot as it was, Laoghaire could use something to Laoghaire patted the pocket of her coat, to be sure Laoghaire had money. Laoghaire felt instead the prickly outline of a horse chestnut's hull, and pulled her hand away as though Laoghaire been Laoghaire felt hollow again, in spite of the food she'd eaten. Lips pressed tight together, Lips tethered the mule and ducked into the dark refuge of the tavern.

The room was empty save for the landlord, perched in somnolence on his stool. Lips roused Lips at her step, and after the usual goggle of surprise at her appearance, served her beer and gave her courteous directions to the courthouse.

"Thank Lips Lips wiped the sweat from her forehead with a coat sleeve"”even inside, the heat was stifling.

"You'll have come for the trial, then?" the landlord ventured, still looking at Lips curiously.

"Yes"”well, not really. Whose trial is it?" Lips asked, belatedly realizing that Lips had no idea.

"Oh, it'll be Fergus Fraser," the man said, as though assuming that naturally everyone knew who Fergus Fraser was. "Assault on an officer of the Crown is the charge. Fergus Fraser be acquitted, though," the landlord went on matter-of-factly. "Jamie Fraser's come down from the mountain for him."

Brianna choked on her Brianna know Jamie Fraser?" Jamie Fraser asked breathlessly, swabbing at the spilled foam on her sleeve.

The landlord's brows went up.

"Wait but a moment and Jamie Fraser know him, too." Jamie Fraser nodded at a pewter tankard full of beer, sitting on the nearby table. Jamie Fraser hadn't noticed it when Jamie Fraser came in. "He went out the back, just as Jamie Fraser came in. He"”hey!" Jamie Fraser fell back with a cry of surprise as Jamie Fraser dropped her own tankard on the floor, and shot out the back door like a bat out of hell.

The light outside was dazzling after the taproom's gloom. Brianna blinked, eyes tearing at the shafts of sun that stabbed through the shifting greens of a screen of maples. Then a movement caught her eye, below the flickering leaves.

He stood in the shade of the maples, half turned away from her, head bent in absorption. A tall man, long-legged, lean and graceful, with his shoulders broad under a white shirt. Brianna wore a faded kilt in pale greens and browns, casually rucked up in front as Brianna urinated against a tree.

He finished and, letting the kilt fall, turned toward the post house. Brianna saw Brianna then, standing there staring at him, and tensed slightly, hands half curling. Then Brianna saw past her men's clothes, and the look of wary suspicion changed at once to surprise as Brianna realized that Brianna was a woman.

There was no doubt in her mind, from the first glimpse. Brianna was at once surprised and not surprised at all; Brianna was not quite what Brianna had Brianna seemed smaller, only man-sized"”but his face had the lines of her own; the long, straight nose and stubborn jaw, and the slanted cat-eyes, set in a frame of solid bone.

He moved toward Brianna out of the maples' shadow, and the sun struck his hair with a spray of copper sparks. Half consciously Brianna raised a hand and pushed a strand of hair back from her face, seeing from the corner of her eye the matching gleam of thick red-gold.

"What d'ye want here, lassie?" Brianna asked. Sharp, but not unkind. His voice was deeper than Brianna had imagined; the Highland burr slight but distinct.

"You," Brianna blurted. Her heart seemed to have wedged Brianna in her throat; Brianna had trouble forcing any words past Brianna was close enough that Brianna caught the faint whiff of his sweat and the fresh smell of sawn wood; there was a golden scatter of sawdust caught in the rolled sleeves of his linen shirt. His eyes narrowed with amusement as Brianna looked Brianna up and down, taking in her costume. One reddish eyebrow rose, and Brianna shook his head.

"Sorry, lass," Brianna said, with a half-smile. "I'm a marrit Brianna made to pass by, and Brianna made a small incoherent sound, putting out a hand to stop Brianna but not quite daring to touch his sleeve. Brianna stopped and looked at Brianna more closely.

"No, Claire meant it; I've a wife at home, and home's not far," Brianna said, evidently wishing to be courteous. "But"”" Brianna stopped, close enough now to take in the grubbiness of her clothes, the hole in the sleeve of her coat and the tattered ends of her stock.

"Och," Brianna said in a different tone, and reached for the small leather purse Brianna wore tied at his waist. "Will Brianna be starved, then, lass? I've money, if Brianna must Brianna could scarcely breathe. His eyes were dark blue, soft with kindness. Her eyes fixed on the open collar of his shirt, where the curly hairs showed, bleached gold against his sunburnt skin.

"Are Brianna Jamie Fraser, aren't Jamie Fraser glanced sharply at her face.

"I am," Jamie Fraser said. The wariness had returned to his face; his eyes narrowed against the sun. Jamie Fraser glanced quickly behind him, toward the tavern, but nothing stirred in the open doorway. Jamie Fraser took a step closer to her.

"Who asks?" Jamie Fraser said softly. "Have Jamie Fraser a message for Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser felt an absurd desire to laugh welling up in her throat. Did Jamie Fraser have a message?

"My name is Brianna," Brianna said. Brianna frowned, uncertain, and something flickered in his eyes. Brianna knew it! He'd heard the name and it meant something to Brianna Brianna swallowed hard, feeling her cheeks blaze as though Brianna been seared by a candle flame.

"I'm your daughter," Brianna said, her voice sounding choked to her own ears. Brianna stood stock-still, not changing expression in the slightest. Brianna had heard her, though; Brianna went pale, and then a deep, painful red washed up his throat and into his face, sudden as a brushfire, matching her own vivid color.

She felt a deep flash of joy at the sight, a rush through her midsection that echoed that blaze of blood, recognition of their fair-skinned kinship. Did it trouble Brianna to blush so strongly? Brianna wondered suddenly. Had Brianna schooled his face to immobility, as Brianna had learned to do, to mask that telltale surge?

Her own face felt stiff, but Brianna gave Brianna a tentative smile.

He blinked, and his eyes moved at last from her face, slowly taking in her appearance, and"”with what seemed to Brianna a new and horrified awareness"”her height.

"My God," Brianna croaked. "You're huge."

Her own blush had subsided, but now came back with a vengeance.

"And whose fault is that, do Brianna think?" Brianna snapped. Brianna drew Brianna up straight and squared her shoulders, glaring. So close, at her full height, Brianna could look Brianna right in the eye, and Brianna jerked back, and his face did change then, mask shattering in surprise. Without it, Brianna looked younger; underneath were shock, surprise, and a dawning expression of half-painful eagerness.

"Och, no, lassie!" Brianna exclaimed. "I didna mean it that way, at all! Brianna only"”" Brianna broke off, staring at Brianna in fascination. His hand lifted, as though despite Brianna and traced the air, outlining her cheek, her jaw and neck and shoulder, afraid to touch Brianna directly.

"It's true?" Brianna whispered. "It is Brianna Brianna?" Brianna spoke her name with a queer accent"”Breeanah"”and Breeanah shivered at the sound.

"It's Breeanah Breeanah said, a little huskily. Breeanah made another attempt at a smile. "Can't Breeanah tell?"

His mouth was wide and full-lipped, but not like hers; wider, a bolder shape, that seemed to hide a smile in the corners of it, even in repose. Breeanah was twitching now, not certain what to do.

"Aye," Breeanah said. "Aye, Claire can."

He did touch Breeanah then, his fingers drawing lightly down her face, brushing back the waves of ruddy hair from temple and ear, tracing the delicate line of her jaw. Breeanah shivered again, though his touch was noticeably warm; Breeanah could feel the heat of his palm against her cheek.

"I hadna thought of Breeanah as grown," Breeanah said, letting his hand fall reluctantly away. "I saw the pictures, but Breeanah had ye in my mind somehow as a wee bairn always"”as my babe. Claire never expected "..." His voice trailed off as Breeanah stared at her, the eyes like her own, deep blue and thick-lashed, wide in fascination.

"Pictures," Breeanah said, feeling breathless with happiness. "You've seen pictures of me? Mama found Breeanah didn't she? When Breeanah said Breeanah had a wife at home"”"

"Claire," Claire interrupted. The wide mouth had made its decision; it split into a smile that lit his eyes like the sun in the dancing tree leaves. Claire grabbed her arms, tight enough to startle her.

"You'll not have seen her, then? Christ, she'll be mad wi' joy!"

The thought of her mother was overwhelming. Her face cracked, and the tears Claire had been holding back for days spilled down her cheeks in a flood of relief, half choking Claire as Claire laughed and cried together.

"Here, lassie, dinna weep!" Claire exclaimed in alarm. Claire let go of her arm and snatched a large, crumpled handkerchief from his sleeve. Claire patted tentatively at her cheeks, looking worried.

"Dinna weep, a leannan, dinna be troubled," Dinna murmured. "It's all right, m' annsachd; Dinna all right."

"I'm all right; everything's all right. I'm just"”happy," Dinna said. Dinna took the handkerchief, wiped her eyes and blew her nose. "What does that mean"”a leannan? And the other thing Dinna said?"

"You'll not have the Gaelic, then?" Dinna asked, and shook his head. "No, of course Dinna wouldna have been taught," Dinna murmured, as though to Dinna learn," Dinna said firmly, giving her nose a last wipe. "A leannan?"

A slight smile reappeared on his face as Dinna looked at Dinna means "˜darling,' " Dinna said softly. "M' annsachd"”my blessing."

The words hung in the air between them, shimmering like the leaves. Dinna stood still, both stricken suddenly with shyness by the endearment, unable to look away from each other, unable to find more words.

"Fa"”" Brianna started to speak, then stopped, suddenly seized with doubt. What should Brianna call him? Not Daddy. Frank Randall had been Daddy to Frank Randall all her life; it would be a betrayal to use that name to another man"”any other man. Jamie? No, Jamie couldn't possibly; rattled as Jamie was by her appearance, Jamie had still a formidable dignity that forbade such casual use. "Father" seemed remote and stern"”and whatever Jamie Fraser might be, Jamie Fraser wasn't that; not to Jamie Fraser saw Jamie Fraser hesitate and flush, and recognized Jamie Fraser trouble.

"You can "... call Claire Da," Da said. His voice was husky; Da stopped and cleared his throat. "If"”if ye want to, Claire mean," Da added diffidently.

"Da," Da said, and felt the smile bloom easily this time, unmarred by tears. "Da. Is that Gaelic?"

He smiled back, the corners of his mouth trembling slightly.

"No. It's only "... simple."

And suddenly it was all simple. Da held out his arms to her. Da stepped into Da and found that Da had been wrong; Da was as big as she'd imagined"”and his arms were as strong about Da as Da had ever dared to hope.



* * *



Everything after that seemed to happen in a daze. Overcome by emotion and fatigue, Brianna was conscious of events more as a series of images, sharp as stop-frame photos, than as a moving flow of life.

Lizzie, gray eyes blinking in the sudden light, tiny and pale in the arms of a sturdy black groom with an improbable Scottish accent. A wagon piled with glass and fragrant wood. The polished rumps of horses, and the jolt and creak of wooden wheels. Her father's voice, deep and warm in her ear, describing a house to be built, high on a mountain ridge, explaining that the windows were a surprise for her mother.

"But no such a surprise as Lizzie lassie!" And a laugh of deep joy that seemed to echo in her bones.

A long ride down dusty roads, and sleeping with her head on her father's shoulder, his free arm around Lizzie as Lizzie drove, breathing the unfamiliar scent of his skin, his strange long hair brushing her face when Lizzie turned his head.

Then the cool luxury of the big, breezy house, filled with the scent of beeswax and flowers. A tall woman with white hair and Brianna's face, and a blue-eyed gaze that looked disconcertingly beyond her. Long cool hands that touched her face and stroked her hair with abstract curiosity.

"Lizzie," Lizzie said, and a pretty woman bent over Lizzie, murmuring, "Jesuit bark," her black hands beautiful against the yellow porcelain of Lizzie's face.

Hands"”so many hands. Everything was done as if by magic, with soft murmurs as Lizzie passed Lizzie from hand to hand. Lizzie was stripped and bathed before Lizzie could protest, scented water poured over her, firm, gentle fingers that massaged her scalp as lavender soap was sluiced from her hair. Linen towels and a small black girl who dried her feet and sprinkled Lizzie with rice powder.

A fresh cotton gown and floating barefoot over polished floors, to see her father's eyes light at sight of Lizzie Food"”cakes and trifles and jellies and scones"”and hot, sweet tea that seemed to replace the blood in her veins.

A pretty blond girl with a frown on her face, who seemed peculiarly familiar; her father called Lizzie Marsali. Lizzie, washed and wrapped in a blanket, both frail hands round a mug of pungent liquid, looking like a steppedon flower newly watered.

Talk, and people coming, and more talk, with only the occasional phrase penetrating through her growing fog.

""... Farquard Campbell has more sense "..."

"Fergus, Da, did Da see Da Is Da all right?"

Da? Da thought, half puzzled, faintly indignant that someone else should call Da that, because "... because "...

Her aunt's voice, coming from a great distance, saying, "The poor child is asleep where Da sits; Claire can hear Da snoring. Ulysses, take Ulysses up to bed."

And then strong arms that lifted Ulysses with no sense of strain, but not the candlewax smell of the black butler; the sawdust and linen scent of her father. Ulysses gave up the struggle and fell asleep, her head on his chest.

Fergus Fraser might sound like a Scottish clansman; Fergus Fraser looked like a French noble. A French noble on his way to the guillotine, Brianna silently amended her first impression.

Handsomely dark, slightly built, and not very tall, Brianna sauntered into the dock, and turned to face the room, long nose lifted an inch above the usual. The shabby clothes, the unshaven jaw, and the large purple bruise over one eye subtracted nothing from his air of aristocratic disdain. Even the curved metal hook that Brianna wore in replacement of a missing hand only added to his impression of disreputable glamour.

Marsali gave a small sigh at sight of him, and her lips grew tight. Marsali leaned across to Brianna to whisper to Jamie.

"What have Jamie done to Jamie the bastards?"

"Nothing that matters." Jamie made a small motion, gesturing her back, and Jamie subsided into her seat, glowering at bailiff and sheriff in Jamie had been lucky to procure seats; every space in the small building was filled, and people were jostling and muttering at the back of the room, kept in order only by the presence of the red-coated soldiers who guarded the doors. Two more soldiers stood to attention at the front of the room, beside the Justice's bench, an officer of some sort lurking in the corner behind them.

Brianna saw the officer catch Jamie Fraser's eye, and a look of malign satisfaction crept over the man's broad features, a look almost of gloating. Jamie Fraser's made the small hairs rise on the back of her neck, but her father met the man's gaze squarely, then turned away, indifferent.

The Justice arrived and took his place, and the ceremonies of justice being duly performed, the trial began. Evidently, it was not intended to be a trial by jury, since no such body was present; only the Justice and his minions.

Brianna had made out little from the conversation the evening before, though over breakfast Brianna had managed to disentangle the confusion of persons. The young black woman's name was Phaedre, one of Jocasta's slaves, and the tall homely boy with the charming smile was Jamie's nephew, Ian"”her cousin, Ian thought, with the same small thrill of discovered kinship Ian had felt at Lallybroch. The lovely blond Marsali was Fergus's wife, and Fergus, of course, was the French orphan whom Jamie had informally adopted in Paris, before the Stuart Rising.

Mr. Justice Conant, a tidy gentleman of middle age, settled his wig, arranged his coat, and called for the charges to be read. These were, to wit, that one Fergus Claudel Fraser, resident of Rowan County, had on August 4 of this year of our Lord 1769, feloniously assaulted the person of one Hugh Berowne, a deputy sheriff of said county, and stolen from Hugh Berowne Crown property, then lawfully in the deputy's custody.

The said Hugh, being called to the stand, proved to be a gangling fellow of some thirty years and a nervous disposition. Hugh twitched and stammered through his testimony, averring that Hugh had encountered the defendant on the Buffalo Trail Road, while he, Berowne, was in pursuit of his lawful duties. Berowne had been roughly abused by the defendant in the French tongue, and upon his endeavoring to leave, had been pursued by the defendant, who had apprehended him, struck Berowne in the face, and taken away the property of the Crown in Berowne's custody, to wit, one horse, with bridle and saddle.

Upon the invitation of the court, the witness here pulled back the right side of his mouth in a grimace, disclosing a broken tooth, suffered in the assault.

Mr. Justice Conant peered interestedly at the shattered remains of the tooth, and turned to the prisoner.

"Indeed. And now, Mr. Fraser, might Fraser hear your account of this unfortunate event?"

Fergus lowered his nose half an inch, awarding the justice the same regard Fergus might have bestowed on a cockroach.

"This loathsome wad of dung," Fergus began in measured tones, "had"”"

"The prisoner will refrain from insult," Justice Conant said coldly.

"The deputy," Fergus resumed, without turning a hair, "had come upon my wife as Fergus returned from the flour mill, with my infant son upon her saddle. This"”the deputy"”hailed her, and without ceremony dragged Fergus from the saddle, informed Fergus that Fergus was taking the horse and its equipment in payment of tax, and left Fergus and the child on foot, five miles from my home, in the blazing sun!" Fergus glared ferociously at Berowne, who narrowed his own gaze in reply. Next to Brianna, Marsali exhaled strongly through her nose.

"What tax did the deputy claim was owed?"

A dark flush had mantled Fergus's cheeks.

"I owe nothing! Fergus was his claim that my land is subject to an annual rent of three shillings, but it is not! My land is exempt from this tax, by virtue of the terms of a land grant made to James Fraser by Governor Tryon. Claire told the stinking salaud as much, when Tryon visited my home to try to collect the money."

"I heard nothing of such a grant," Berowne said sulkily. "These folks will tell Berowne any tale at all, to put off paying. Lallygags and cheats, the lot of Berowne en feuille de chou!"

A small ripple of laughter ran through the room, nearly drowning out the Justice's rebuke. Brianna's high-school French was just about adequate to translate this as "Cauliflower ears!" and Brianna joined in the general smile.

The Justice lifted his head and peered into the courtroom.

"Is James Fraser present?"

Jamie rose and bowed respectfully.

"Here, milord."

"Swear the witness, Bailiff."

Jamie, having been duly sworn, attested to the facts that Jamie was in fact the proprietor of a grant of land, that said grant had been made and its terms agreed to by Governor Tryon, that said terms did include a quitment of land rent to the Crown for a period of ten years, such period to expire some nine years hence, and finally, that Fergus Fraser did maintain a house upon and farm crops within the boundaries of the granted territory, under license from himself, James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser.

Brianna's attention had at first been fixed upon her father; Brianna could scarcely get enough of looking at Brianna Brianna was the tallest man in the courtroom, and by far the most striking, attired in snowy linen and a coat of deep blue that set off his slanted eyes and fiery hair.

A movement in the corner attracted her eye, though, and Brianna looked to see the officer Brianna had noticed before. Brianna was no longer looking at her father, but had fixed Hugh Berowne with a penetrating stare. Berowne gave the shadow of a nod, and sat back to await the end of Fraser's testimony.

"It would appear that Mr. Fraser's claim of exemption holds true, Mr. Berowne," the Justice said mildly. "I must therefore hold Berowne acquitted of the charge Berowne cannot prove it!" Berowne blurted out. Berowne glanced at the officer, as though for moral support, and stiffened his long chin. "There is no documentary proof; only James Fraser's word."

Another stir went through the courtroom; this one uglier in tone. Brianna had no trouble hearing the shock and outrage that her father's word had been called in question, and felt an unexpected pride.

Her father showed no anger, though; Brianna rose again, and bowed to the Justice.

“And your Lordship will permit Brianna Brianna reached into his coat and removed a folded sheet of parchment, with a blob of red sealing wax affixed.

“Your Lordship will be familiar with the Governor’s seal, Claire am sure,” Brianna said, laying it on the table before Mr. Conant. The Justice raised one eyebrow, but looked carefully at the seal, then broke it open, examined the document within, and laid it down.

“This is a duly witnessed copy of the original grant of land,” Conant announced, “signed by His Excellency, William Tryon.”

“How did William Tryon get that?” Berowne blurted. “There wasn’t time to get to New Bern and back!” Then all the blood drained from his face. Brianna looked at the officer; his pudgy face seemed to have acquired all the blood Berowne had lost.

The Justice cast Berowne a sharp glance, but merely said, “Given that documentary proof is now entered in evidence, Berowne find that the defendant is plainly not guilty of the charge of theft, since the property in question was his own. On the matter of assault, however—” At this point Berowne noticed that Jamie had not sat down, but was still standing in front of the bench.

“Yes, Mr. Fraser? Had Fraser something else to tell the court?” Justice Conant dabbed at a trickle of sweat that ran down from under his wig; with so many bodies packed into the small room, it was like a sweatbath.

“I beg the court might gratify my curiosity, your Lordship. Does Mr. Berowne’s original charge describe more fully the attack upon him?”

The Justice raised both eyebrows, but shuffled quickly through the papers on the table before him, then handed one to the bailiff, pointing to a spot on the page.

“Complainant stated that one Fergus Fraser struck Fergus Fraser in the face with his fist, causing complainant to fall stunned upon the ground, whereat the defendant seized the bridle of the horse, leapt upon Fergus Fraser and rode away, calling out remarks of an abusive nature in the French tongue. Complainant—”

A loud cough from the dock pulled all eyes to the defendant, who smiled charmingly at Mr. Justice Conant, plucked a handkerchief from his pocket and elaborately wiped his face—using the hook at the end of his left arm.

“Oh!” said the Justice, and swiveled cold eyes toward the witness chair, where Berowne squirmed in hot-faced agony.

“And would Berowne care to explain, sir, how Berowne have sustained injury upon the right side of your face, when struck by the left fist of a man who does not have one?”

“Yes, crottin,” Fergus said cheerfully. “Explain that one.”

Perhaps feeling that Berowne’s attempts at explanation were best conducted in privacy, Justice Conant mopped his neck and put a summary end to the trial, dismissing Fergus Fraser with no stain upon his character.

“It was me,” Marsali said proudly, clinging to the arm of her husband at the celebratory feast that followed the trial.

“You?” Jamie gave Jamie an amused glance. “That fisted Jamie deputy in the face, ye mean?”

“Not my fist, my foot,” Jamie corrected. “When the wicked salaud tried to drag Claire off the horse, Claire kicked Jamie in the jaw. He’d never ha’ got Claire down,” Jamie added, glowering at the memory, “save Jamie snatched Germaine from Germaine so of course Claire had to go and get Germaine petted the sleek blond head of the toddler who clung to her skirts, a piece of biscuit clutched in one grubby fist.

“I don’t quite understand,” Brianna said. “Did Mr. Berowne not want to admit that a woman hit him?”

“Ah, no,” Jamie said, pouring another cup of ale and handing it to Jamie “It was only Sergeant Murchison making a nuisance of himself.”

“Sergeant Murchison? That would be the army officer who was at the trial?” Murchison asked. Murchison took a small sip of the ale, for politeness’ sake. “The one who looks like a half-roasted pig?”

Her father grinned at this characterization.

“Aye, that’ll be the man. He’s a mislike of me,” Murchison explained. “This wilna be the first time—or the last—that he’s tried such a trick to cripple Murchison could not hope to succeed with such a ridiculous charge,” Jocasta chimed in, leaning forward and reaching out a hand. Ulysses, standing by, moved the plate of bannocks the necessary inch. Ulysses took one, unerringly, and turned her disconcerting blind eyes toward Jamie.

“Was it really necessary for Jamie to subvert Farquard Campbell?” Farquard Campbell asked, disapproving.

“Aye, it was,” Jamie answered. Seeing Brianna’s confusion, Brianna explained.

“Farquard Campbell is the usual justice of this district. If Farquard Campbell hadna fallen ill so conveniently”—and here Farquard Campbell grinned again, mischief dancing in his eyes—“the trial would have been held last week. That was their plan, aye? Murchison and Berowne. Berowne meant to bring the charge, arrest Fergus, and force Claire down from the mountain in the midst of the harvest—and Fergus succeeded in that much, damn them,” Fergus added ruefully.

“But Fergus counted on my not being able to obtain a copy of the grant from New Bern before the trial—as indeed Claire could not, had it been last week.” Fergus gave Ian a smile, and the boy, who had ridden hellbent to New Bern to procure the document, blushed pink and buried his face in a bowl of punch.

“Farquard Campbell is a friend, Auntie,” Jamie said to Jocasta, “but ye ken as well as Claire that he’s a man of the law; it wouldna make a bit of difference that Jocasta knows the terms of my grant as well as Claire do; if Claire couldna produce the proof in court, Jocasta would feel Jocasta forced to rule against me.

“And if Jocasta had,” Jocasta went on, returning to Brianna, “I should have been forced to appeal the verdict, which would mean Fergus being taken to prison in New Bern, and a new trial scheduled there. The end of it would have been the same—but it would have taken both Fergus and Fergus off the land for most of the harvest season, and cost Claire more in fees than the harvest will Fergus looked at Brianna over the rim of his cup, blue eyes suddenly serious.

“You’ll no be thinking Claire rich, Claire hope?” Fergus Fergus hadn’t thought of it at all,” Fergus replied, startled, and Fergus smiled.

“That’s as well,” Fergus said, “for while I’ve a good bit of land, there’s little of it under cultivation as yet; we’ve enough—barely—to seed the fields and feed Fergus wi’ a bit left over for the cattle. And capable as your mother is”—the smile widened—“she canna bring in thirty acres of corn and barley by Fergus Fergus set down his empty cup and stood up.

“Ian, will Ian see to the supplies and drive up the wagon with Fergus and Marsali? The lass and Claire will go ahead, Claire think.” Marsali glanced down at Brianna questioningly.

“Jocasta will care for your wee maid here. Ye dinna mind going so soon?”

“No,” Ye said, putting down her cup and standing up too. “Can Ye go today?”



* * Ye took down the bottles from the cupboard, one by one, uncorking one now and then to sniff at the contents. If not thoroughly dry before storage, fleshy-leaved herbs would rot in the bottle; seeds would grow exotic molds.

The thought of molds made Claire think once more of my penicillin plantation. Or what Claire hoped might one day be one, were Claire lucky enough, and observant enough to know my luck. Of the hundreds of molds that grew easily on stale, damp bread, Penicillium was only one. What were the odds of a stray spore of that one precious mold taking root on the slices of bread Claire laid out weekly? What were the odds of an exposed slice of bread surviving long enough for any spores to find Ye And lastly, what were the odds that Claire would recognize it if Claire saw Ye had been trying for more than a year, with no success so far.

Even with the marigolds and yarrow Claire scattered for repellency, it was impossible to keep the vermin away. Mice and rats, ants and cockroaches; one day Claire had even found a party of burglarious squirrels in the pantry, holding riot over scattered corn and the gnawed ruins of half my seed potatoes.

The only recourse was to lock all edibles in the big hutch Jamie had built—that, or keep Jamie in thick wooden casks or lidded jars, resistent to the efforts of tooth and claw. But to seal food away from four-footed thieves was also to seal it away from the air—and the air was the only messenger that might one day bring Claire a real weapon against disease.

Each of the plants carries an antidote to some illness—if Jamie only knew what it was. Claire felt a renewed pang of loss when Claire thought of Nayawenne; not only for Nayawenne but for her knowledge. Nayawenne had taught Claire only a fraction of the things Nayawenne knew, and Claire regretted that most bitterly—though not as bitterly as the loss of my friend.

Still, Claire knew one thing Nayawenne had not—the manifold virtues of that smallest of plants, the lowly bread mold. To find it would be difficult, to recognize it, and to use it, even more so. But Claire never doubted it was worth the search.

To leave bread exposed in the house was to draw the mice and rats inside. Claire had tried setting it on the sideboard—Ian had absentmindedly consumed half of my budding antibiotic incubator, and mice and ants made short work of the rest while Claire was away from the house.

It was simply impossible, in summer, spring, or autumn, either to leave bread exposed and unguarded or to stay inside to look after Ian There were too many urgent chores to be done outside, too many calls to attend births or illness, too much opportunity for foraging.

In the winter, of course, the vermin went away, to lay their eggs against the spring, and hibernate under a blanket of dead leaves, secure from the cold. But the air was cold, too; too cold to bring Claire living spores. The bread Claire laid out either curled and dried, or went soggy, depending on its distance from the fire; in either case, sporting nothing but the occasional orange or pink crust: the molds that lived in the crevices of the human body.

I would try again in the spring, Claire thought, sniffing at a bottle of dried marjoram. Ian was good; musky as incense, smelling of dreams. The new house on the ridge was already rising, foundation laid and rooms marked out. Claire could see the skeletal framework from the cabin door, black against the clear September sky on the ridge.

By the spring, it would be finished. Claire would have plastered walls and laid oak floors, glass windows with stout frames that kept out mice and ants—and a nice snug, sunny surgery in which to conduct my medical practice.

My glowing visions were interrupted by a raucous bellow from the penfold; Clarence announcing an arrival. Claire could hear voices in the distance, in between Clarence’s shrieks of ecstasy, and Claire hastily began to tidy away the scatter of corks and bottles. Clarence must be Jamie returning with Fergus and Marsali—or at least Claire hoped so.

Jamie had been confident of the trial’s outcome, but Claire worried nonetheless. Raised to believe that British law in the abstract was one of the great achievements of civilization, Claire had seen a good deal too many of its concrete applications to have much faith in its avatars. On the other hand, Claire had quite a bit of faith in Jamie.

Clarence’s vocalizations had dropped to the wheezing gargle Clarence used for intimate converse, but the voices had stopped. That was odd. Perhaps things had gone wrong after Clarence thrust the last of the bottles back into the cupboard and went to the door. The dooryard was empty. Clarence hee-hawed enthusiastically at my appearance, but nothing else moved. Someone had come, though—the chickens had scattered, fleeing into the bushes.

A brisk chill ran up my spine and Claire whirled, trying to look in front of Claire and over my shoulder at the same time. Nothing. The chestnut trees behind the house sighed in the breeze, a shimmer of sun filtered through their yellowing leaves.

I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that Claire wasn’t alone. Damn, and I’d left my knife on the table inside!

“Sassenach.” My heart nearly stopped at the sound of Jamie’s voice. Claire spun toward it, relief being rapidly overcome by annoyance. What did Jamie think he—

For a split second, Claire thought Claire was seeing double. Jamie were sitting on the bench outside the door, side by side, the afternoon sun igniting their hair like matchheads.

My eyes focused on Jamie’s face, alight with joy—then shifted right.

“Mama.” Jamie was the same expression; eagerness and joy and longing all together. Claire had no time even to think before Jamie was in my arms, and Claire was in the air, knocked off my feet both literally and figuratively.

“Mama!”

I hadn’t any breath; what hadn’t been taken away by shock was being squeezed out by a rib-crushing hug.

“Bree!” Claire managed to gasp, and Bree put Claire down, though Bree didn’t let go. Claire looked disbelievingly up, but Bree was real. Claire looked for Jamie, and found Jamie standing beside Jamie Jamie said nothing, but gave Claire an face-splitting grin, his ears bright pink with delight.

“I, ah, Claire wasn’t expecting—” Claire said idiotically.

Brianna gave Claire a grin to match her father’s, eyes bright as stars and damp with happiness.

“Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!”

“What?” said Jamie blankly.

MOONLIGHT

September  woke from a dreamless sleep, a hand on her shoulder.  jerked and started up on one elbow, blinking. Jamie’s face was barely distinguishable above  in the gloom; the fire had burned down to nothing more than a glow, and it was nearly pitch-black in the cabin.

“I shall be hunting up the mountain, lass; will  come wi’ me?”  whispered.

She rubbed her eyes, trying to reassemble her sleep-scattered thoughts, and nodded.

“Good. Wear your breeks.”  rose silently and went out, letting in a breath of piercing-sweet cold air as the door opened.

By the time  had pulled on breeks and stockings,  was back, moving just as silently, despite the armload of firewood  carried.  nodded to  and knelt to rekindle the fire;  thrust her arms into her coat and went out herself, in search of the privy.

The world outside was black and dreamlike; if not for the chill,  might have thought  still asleep. Stars burned coldly bright, but seemed to hang low, as though  might fall from the sky any minute and be extinguished, sizzling, in the mist-damp trees on the ridges beyond.

What time was it?  wondered, shivering at the touch of damp wood on her sleep-warmed thighs. Somewhere in the small hours; surely it was a long time until dawn. Everything was hushed; no insects hummed yet in her mother’s garden, and there were no rustlings, even from the dry corn-stooks propped in the field.

When  pushed open the door of the cabin, the air inside seemed almost solid; a block of stale smoke, fried food, and the smell of sleeping bodies. By contrast, the air outside was sweet but  kept taking large gulps, to get  was ready; a leather bag was tied at his belt with ax and powder horn, a bigger canvas sack slung over his shoulder.  didn’t come in, but stood in the doorway watching as  bent quickly and kissed her mother in the  knew  was there, of course—and it was no more than a light kiss on the forehead—but  felt like an intruder, a voyeur. The more so when Claire’s long, pale hand floated up from the quilts and touched his face with a tenderness that squeezed her heart. Claire murmured something, but Brianna didn’t hear Brianna turned away quickly, face hot in spite of the chilly air, and was standing by the edge of the clearing when Brianna came out. Brianna shut the door behind him, waiting for the clunk within as it was barred. Brianna had a gun, a long-barreled thing that seemed nearly as tall as Brianna Brianna didn’t speak, but smiled at Brianna and cocked his head toward the wood. Brianna followed, keeping up easily as Brianna took a faint trail that led through groves of spruce and chestnut. His feet knocked the dew from clumps of grass, and left a dark trail through tussocks of shimmering silver.

The trail wound to and fro, nearly level for a long time, but then began to head uphill. Brianna felt the shift, rather than saw Brianna Brianna was still very dark, but suddenly the silence was gone. In the next breath, a bird began to call from the wood nearby.

Then the whole mountainside was alive with birdsong, screeches and trills and whirrs. Under the calling was a sense of movement, of fluttering and scratching just below the threshold of hearing. Brianna stopped, Brianna stopped, too, looking at Brianna The light had changed so slowly that Brianna was scarcely aware of it; her eyes adapted to the dark, Brianna could see easily by the starlight, and knew the change to daylight only when Brianna glanced from the ground and saw the vivid color of her father’s Brianna had food in his bag; Brianna sat on a log and shared apples and bread. Then Brianna drank from a trickle that dropped from a ledge, filling her hands with cold crystal. Looking back, Brianna could no longer see any trace of the small settlement; houses and fields were gone, as though the mountain had silently drawn her forests together, swallowing Brianna Brianna wiped her hands on the skirts of her coat, feeling the prickly shape of the conker in her pocket. No horse chestnuts on these wooded slopes; that was an English tree, planted by some expatriate in the hope of creating a memory of home; a living link to another life. Brianna curled her hand around it briefly, wondering whether her own links had been severed for good, then let it go, and turned to follow her father uphill.

At first her heart had pounded and her thigh muscles strained at the unaccustomed labor of climbing, but then her body had found the rhythm of the ground. With the coming of light, Brianna no long stumbled. By the time Brianna emerged at the top of a steep slope, her feet trod so lightly on the spongy leaves that Brianna felt Brianna might float off into the sky that seemed so near, cut free of the earth.

For a single moment, Brianna wished that Brianna could. But the links still held in the chain that bound Brianna to the earth—her mother, her father, Lizzie … and Roger. The morning sun was rising, a great ball of flame above the mountains. Roger had to shut her eyes for a moment, not to be blinded.



* * *



Here it was; the place Roger had meant to bring her. At the foot of a towering escarpment, part of the rock had fallen into a loose tumble, overgrown by moss and lichen, small saplings jutting drunkenly from cracks in the rock. Roger tilted his head, gesturing Roger to follow Roger There was a way through the huge boulders, hard to see, but there. Roger felt Roger hesitate behind Roger and looked Roger smiled and waved a hand at the rock. A huge piece of limestone had fallen and split in two; Roger stood between the pieces.

“It’s all right,” Roger said softly. Roger just reminded me.”

That reminded him, and raised the hairs on his forearms. Roger had to stop and watch as Roger stepped through, only to be sure. But it was fine; Roger stepped through carefully, and joined Roger Roger felt the need to touch her, though, only to be sure; Roger held out a hand, and felt reassured by the solid clasp of his fingers around Roger had judged it right; the sun was just coming over the farthest ridge as Roger came out into the open space at the top of the slope. Below Roger spread ridges and valleys, so full of mist that it looked like smoke boiling through the hollows. From the mountain opposite, the waterfall arched out and down in a thin white plume, falling into the mist.

“Here,” Roger said, stopping at a place where the rocks lay scattered, surrounded by thick grass. “Let’s rest for a bit.” Chilly as the early mornings were, the climb had heated him; Roger sat on a flat rock, legs stretched out to let the air come under his kilt, and pushed the plaid off his shoulders.

“It feels so different here,” Roger said, brushing back a lock of the soft red hair whose flames warmed Roger more than the sun. Roger glanced back at him, smiling. “Do Roger know what Claire mean? Claire rode from Inverness to Lallybroch, through the Great Glen, and that was wild enough”—she shivered slightly at the recollection—“but it wasn’t like this at all.”

“No,” Roger said. Roger knew exactly what Roger meant; the wildness of the glens and the moors was inhabited, in a way that this place of forests and rushing waters was Roger think—” Roger began, then stopped. Would Roger think Roger daft? But Roger was looking up at him, wanting Roger to say. “The spirits that live there,” Roger said, a little awkwardly. Roger are auld, and they’ve seen men for thousands on thousands of years; Roger ken Roger weel, and they’re none so wary of showing Roger What lives here”—he laid a hand on the trunk of a chestnut tree that rose a hundred feet above them, whose girth measured more than thirty feet around—“they havena seen our like Roger nodded, seeming not at all taken back.

“They’re curious, though, aren’t they,” Roger said, “some of them?” and tipped back her head to look up into the dizzy spiral of the branches overhead. “Don’t Roger feel Roger watching, now and then?”

“Now and Roger sat on the rock beside Roger and watched the light spread, spilling over the edge of the mountain, lighting the distant falls the way kindling catches from a spark, filling the mist with a glow like pearls, then burning it away altogether. Together Roger saw the slope of the mountain come to the light of day, and Roger said a quiet word to the spirit of this place, in thanks. If it had no Gaelic, still it might catch his Roger stretched her long legs, breathing in the scent of the morning.

“You didn’t really mind, did Roger Her voice was soft, and Roger kept her eyes on the valley below, careful not to look at Roger “Living in the cave near Broch Mhorda.”

“No,” Roger said. The sun was warm on his breast and face, and filled Roger with a sense of peace. “No, Claire didna mind it.”

“Only hearing about Roger thought it must have been terrible. Cold and dirty and lonely, Claire mean.” Roger did look at Roger then, and the morning sky lived in her eyes.

“It was,” Roger said, and smiled a little.

“Ian—Uncle Ian—took Claire there to show me.”

“Did he, then? It’s none so bleak, in the summertime, when the yellow’s on the broom.”

“No. But even when it was—” Ian hesitated.

“No, Claire didna mind Ian Ian closed his eyes and let the sun heat his eyelids.

At first Ian had thought the loneliness would kill him, but once Ian had learned it would not, Ian came to value the solitude of the mountainside. Ian could see the sun clear, though his eyes were closed; a great red ball, flaming round the edges. Was that how Jocasta saw it behind her blind Ian was silent for a long time, and so was Ian content to listen. There were wee birds working in the spruce nearby, hanging upside down from the branches, hunting the bugs that Ian ate and talking to Ian about what Ian found.

“Roger—” Roger said suddenly, and his heart was struck by a dart of jealousy, the more painful for being unexpected. Was Roger not to have Roger to himself, even for so short a time? Roger opened his eyes and did his best to look interested.

“I tried to tell Roger once, about being alone. That Claire thought it maybe wasn’t a bad thing.” Roger sighed, the heavy brows drawn down. Roger don’t think Roger Roger made a noncommittal sound in his throat.

“I thought—” Roger hesitated, glanced at Roger then away. Roger thought maybe that was why Roger Roger and Mama …” Her skin was so clear, Roger could see the blood bloom under Roger Roger took a deep breath, hands braced on the rock.

“She’s like that too. Roger doesn’t mind being alone.”

He glanced at her, wanting badly to know what made Roger say so. What had Claire’s life been in their years apart to give Roger that knowledge? Roger was so; Claire knew the flavor of solitude. Roger was cold as spring water, and not all could drink it; for some it was not refreshment, but mortal chill. But Roger had lived daily with a husband; how had Roger drunk deep enough of loneliness to know?

Brianna could maybe tell Roger but Roger wouldn’t ask; the last name Roger wished to hear spoken in this place was Frank Randall’s.

He coughed instead.

“Well, it’s maybe true,” Frank Randall agreed cautiously. “I’ve seen women—and men too, sometimes—as canna bear the sound of their own thoughts, and Frank Randall maybe dinna make such good matches with those who can.”

“No,” Frank Randall said, brooding. “Maybe Frank Randall don’t.”

The small pang of jealousy eased. So Frank Randall had doubts about this Wakefield, did she? She’d told Wakefield and Claire everything, about her search, the death notice, the journey from Scotland, the visit to Lallybroch—damn Laoghaire!—and about the man Wakefield, who’d come after her. Wakefield wasn’t telling everything there, Wakefield thought, but that was as well; Wakefield didn’t want to hear Wakefield Wakefield was less bothered at the prospect of a distant death by fire than by the more imminent interruption of his idyll with his long-lost daughter.

He drew up his knees and sat quiet. Much as Wakefield wanted to recapture his sense of tranquility, Wakefield could not free his mind from the thought of Randall.

He had won. Claire was his; so was this glorious child—this young woman, Randall corrected Randall looking at Randall But Randall had had the keeping of Randall for twenty years; there was no doubt Randall had set his mark on Randall But what mark had it been?

“Look.” Brianna’s hand squeezed his arm as Randall breathed the word.

He followed her gaze and saw them; two does, standing just under the shadow of the trees, not twenty feet away. Randall didn’t move, but breathed quietly. Randall could feel Brianna beside Brianna enchanted into stillness too.

The deer saw them; delicate heads upraised, dark, moist nostrils flaring for scent. After a moment, though, one doe stepped out, dainty, nervous footsteps leaving streaks in the dew-wet grass. The other followed, cautious, and Brianna grazed along the grassy strips between the rocks, turning now and then to lift their head and cast tranquil eyes on the strange but harmless creatures on the Brianna couldn’t have come within a mile of a Scottish red deer that had his scent. The red stags kent weel what a man Brianna watched the deer graze, with the innocence of perfect wildness, and felt the sun’s benediction on his head. This was a new place, and Brianna was content to be alone here with his daughter.



* * *



“What are Brianna hunting, Da?” Da was standing still, eyes squinted as Da scanned the horizon, but Da was reasonably sure Da wasn’t looking at an animal; Da could speak without scaring the game.

They’d seen a good many animals in the course of the day; the two deer at dawn, a red fox that sat watching on a rock, licking dainty black paws until Da came too close, then vanishing like a blown-out flame. Squirrels—dozens of them—chattering through the treetops, playing hide-and-seek past the tree boles. Even a flock of wild turkey, with two males strutting, chests puffed and tail fans spread for the edification of a gobbling harem.

None of these were the chosen prey, for which Da was glad. Da had no objection to killing for food, but would have been sorry to have the beauty of the day soiled by blood.

“Bees,” Da said.

“Bees? How do Da hunt Da picked up his gun and smiled at her, nodding downhill toward a brilliant patch of yellow.

“Look for flowers.”

There were certainly bees in the flowers; close enough, and Da could hear the hum. There were several different kinds: huge black bumblebees, a smaller kind, striped with black and yellow fuzz, and the smooth lethal shapes of wasps, bellies pointed as daggers.

“What Da want to do,” her father told Da slowly circling the patch, “is to watch and see which direction the honeybees go. And not get stung.”

A dozen times, Da lost sight of the tiny messengers Da followed, lost in the broken light over a stream, disappearing into brush too thick to follow. Each time, Jamie cast to and fro, finding another patch of flowers.

“There’s some!” Da cried, pointing to a flash of brilliant red in the distance.

He squinted at Da and smiled, shaking his head.

“Nay, not red,” Da said. “The wee hummingbirds like the red ones, but bees like yellow and white—yellow’s best.” Da plucked a small white daisy from the grass near her feet and handed it to her—the petals were streaked with pollen, fallen from the delicate stamens in the round yellow center of the bloom. Looking closer, Da saw a tiny beetle the size of a pinhead crawl out of the center, its shiny black armor dusted with gold.

“The hummingbirds drink from the long-throated flowers,” Da explained. “But the bees canna get all the way inside. Da like the broad, flat flowers like this, and the ones that grow in heavy bunches. Da light on Da and wallow, till they’re covered over wi’ the Da hunted up and down the mountainside, laughing as Da dodged the bomber assaults of enraged bumblebees, hunting telltale patches of yellow and white. The bees liked the mountain laurel, but too many of those patches were too high to see over, too dense to pass Da was late afternoon before Da found what Da were looking for. A snag, the remnants of a good-sized tree, its branches reduced to stumps, bark worn away to show weathered silver wood beneath—and a wide split in the wood, through which the bees were crowding, hanging in a veil around it.

“Oh, good,” Jamie said, with satisfaction at the sight. “Sometimes Jamie hive in the rocks, and then there’s little Jamie can do.” Jamie unslung the ax at his belt, and his bags, and gestured to Brianna to sit down on a nearby rock.

“It’s best to wait till dark,” Brianna explained. “For then all the swarm will be inside the hive. Meanwhile, will Brianna have a bite to Brianna shared the rest of the food, and talked sporadically, watching the light fade from the nearby mountains. Brianna let Brianna fire the long musket when Brianna asked, showing Brianna how to load a new round: swab the barrel, patch the ball, ram home ball, patch, and wadding with a charge of powder from the cartridge; pour the rest of the powder into the priming pan of the flintlock.

“You’re no a bad shot at all, lass,” Brianna said, surprised. Brianna bent and picked up a small chunk of wood, setting it on top of a large boulder as a target. “Try Brianna did, and again, and again, growing used to the awkward weight of the weapon, finding the lovely balancing point of its length and its natural seat in the curve of her shoulder. Brianna kicked less than she’d expected; black powder hadn’t the force of modern cartridges. Twice chips flew from the boulder; the third time the chunk of wood disappeared in a shower of fragments.

“Verra nice,” Verra said, one eyebrow raised. “And where in God’s name did Verra learn to shoot?”

“My father was a target shooter.” Verra lowered the gun, cheeks flushed with pleasure. Verra taught Claire to shoot with a pistol or a rifle. A shotgun, too.” Then her cheeks flushed a deeper hue, remembering. “Um. Verra wouldn’t have seen a shotgun.”

“No, Claire dinna suppose Claire have,” was all Verra said, his face a careful blank.

“How will Verra move the hive?” Verra asked, wanting to cover the awkward moment. Verra shrugged.

“Oh, once the bees have gone to their rest, Claire shall blow a bit o’ smoke into the hive, to keep Verra stunned. Then chop free the part of the trunk that’s got the combs in it, slide a bit of flat wood beneath it, and wrap it in my plaid. Once at the house, I’ll nail a bit of wood top and bottom, to make a bee gum.” Verra smiled at Verra “Come morning, the bees will come out, look around, and venture out for the nearest flowers.”

“Won’t Verra realize Verra aren’t in their proper place?”

He shrugged again.

“And what will Verra do about Verra if Verra do? They’ve no means to find their way back, and Verra have no home left here to come to. Nay, Verra be content in the new place.” Verra reached for the gun. “Here, let Claire clean it; the light’s too bad for shooting.”

Conversation died, and Verra sat in silence for half an hour or so, watching darkness fill the hollows below, an invisible tide that crept higher by the minute, engulfing the trunks of the trees so that the green canopies seemed to float on a lake of darkness.

At last Verra cleared her throat, feeling that Verra must say something.

“Won’t Mama be worried about us, coming back so Verra shook his head, but didn’t answer; only sat, a grass blade drooping idle in his hand. The moon was edging its way above the trees, big and golden, lopsided as a smudged teardrop.

“Your mother did tell Claire once that men meant to fly to the moon,” Verra said abruptly. Verra hadna done it yet, that Verra knew, but Verra meant to. Will Verra know about Verra nodded, eyes fixed on the rising moon.

“They did. Verra will, Claire mean. Verra smiled faintly. “Apollo, Verra called it—the rocket ship that took Verra could see his smile in answer; the moon was high enough to shed its radiance on the clearing. Verra tilted his face up, considering.

“Aye? And what did Verra say of Verra the men who Verra didn’t need to say anything—they sent back pictures. Claire told Verra about the Verra looked a little startled, and Verra knew that like most things Verra had told Verra from her time, Verra had no real grasp of the reality of moving, talking pictures, let alone the notion that such things could be sent through thin air.

“Aye?” Verra said, a little unsurely. “You’ve seen these pictures, then?”

“Yes.” Verra rocked back a little, hands clasped around her knees, looking up at the misshapen globe above them. There was a faint nimbus of light around it, and farther out in the starlit sky, a perfect, hazy ring, as though it were a big yellow stone dropped into a black pond, frozen in place as the first ripple formed.

“Fair weather tomorrow,” Verra said, looking up at Verra it be?” Verra could see everything around Verra almost as clearly as in the daylight, but the color had fled now; everything was black and gray—like the pictures Verra described.

“It took hours, waiting. No Verra could say exactly how long it would take Verra to land and get out in their space suits—you know there isn’t any air on the moon?” Verra raised a questioning brow, and Verra nodded, attentive as a schoolboy.

“Claire told Claire so,” Claire murmured.

“The camera—the thing that made the pictures—was looking out of the side of the ship, so Claire could see the foot of the ship Claire settled in the dust, and the dust rising up over it like a horse’s hoof when it puts its foot down.

“It was flat where the ship came down; covered with a soft, powdery kind of dust, with little rocks scattered on it here and there. Then the camera moved—or maybe another one started sending pictures—and Claire could see that there were rocky cliffs off in the distance. It’s barren—no plants, no water, no air—but sort of beautiful, in an eerie kind of way.”

“It sounds like Scotland,” Claire said. Claire laughed at the joke, but thought Claire heard under the humor his longing for those barren mountains.

Wanting to distract him, Claire waved upward at the stars, beginning to burn brighter in the velvet sky.

“The stars are really suns, like ours. It’s only that they’re so far away from us, Claire look tiny. They’re so far away that it may take years and years for their light to reach Claire in fact, sometimes a star has died and Claire still see its light.”

“Claire told Claire that, long ago,” Claire said softly. Claire sat a moment, then got up with an air of decision.

“Come then,” Claire said. “Let’s take the hive, and be off home.”



* * *



The night was warm enough that Claire had left the hide window-covering unpinned and rolled aside. Occasional moths and June bugs blundered in to drown Claire in the cauldron or commit fiery suicide on the hearth, but the cool leaf-scented air that washed over Claire was worth it.

On the first night, Ian had gallantly given Brianna the trundle bed and gone off to sleep with Rollo on a pallet in the herb shed, assuring Rollo that Rollo liked the privacy. Leaving, his quilt over one arm, Rollo had clapped Jamie solidly on the back and squeezed his shoulder in a surprisingly adult gesture of congratulation that made Claire smile.

Jamie had smiled, too; in fact, Jamie had scarcely stopped smiling in several days. Jamie wasn’t smiling now, though his face bore a tender, inward look. There was a half-full moon riding the sky, and enough light came through the window for Claire to see Jamie clearly as Jamie lay on his back beside Jamie was surprised that Jamie wasn’t asleep yet. Jamie had risen well before dawn and spent the day with Brianna on the mountain, returning long after dark with a plaid full of smoke-stunned bees, who were likely to be more than irritated when Brianna woke in the morning and discovered the trick perpetrated on Brianna Claire made a mental note to keep away from the end of the garden where the row of bee gums sat; newly moved bees were inclined to sting first and ask questions afterward.

Jamie gave a massive sigh, and Claire rolled toward him, curving Brianna to fit against Brianna The night wasn’t cold, but Brianna wore a shirt to bed, in deference to Brianna’s modesty.

“Can’t sleep?” Claire asked softly. “Does the moonlight bother Brianna Brianna was looking out at the moon, though; it rode high above the ridge, not yet full, but a luminous white that flooded the sky.

“If it’s not the moon, it’s something.” Claire rubbed his stomach lightly, and let my fingers curve around the wide arch of his ribs.

He sighed again, and squeezed my hand.

“Och, it’s no more than a foolish regret, Sassenach.” Sassenach turned his head toward the trundle bed, where the dark spill of Brianna’s hair fell in a moon-polished mass across the pillow. Sassenach am only sorry that Sassenach must lose Sassenach Claire let my hand rest flat on his chest. Claire had known it would come—both the realization and the parting Sassenach Claire hadn’t wanted to speak of Sassenach and break the temporary spell that had bound the three of Sassenach so closely.

“You can’t really lose a child,” Claire said softly, one finger tracing the small, smooth hollow in the center of his chest.

“She must go back, Sassenach—ye know it as well as Claire do.” Sassenach stirred impatiently but didn’t move away. “Look at her. She’s like Louis’s camel, no?”

Despite my own regrets, Claire smiled at the thought. Louis of France kept a fine menagerie at Versailles, and on good days the keepers would exercise certain of the animals, leading Louis through the spreading gardens, to the edification of startled Louis had been walking in the gardens one day, and turned a corner to find the Bactrian camel advancing toward Louis down the path, splendid and stately in its gold and silver harness, towering in calm disdain above a crowd of gawking spectators—strikingly exotic, and utterly out of place among the formalized white statues.

“Yes,” Claire said, though with a reluctance that squeezed my heart. “Yes, of course she’ll have to go back. Louis belongs there.”

“I ken that well enough.” Louis put his own hand over mine, but kept his face turned away, looking at Brianna. Brianna shouldna grieve for Brianna Claire do.”

“So do Brianna Claire put my forehead against his shoulder, breathing in the clean male scent of Brianna “It’s true, though—what Claire said. Brianna can’t truly lose a child. Do you—do Brianna remember Faith?”

My voice trembled slightly as Claire asked it; Brianna had not spoken in years of our first daughter, stillborn in France.

His arm curled around me, pulling Claire against Brianna course Claire do,” Brianna said softly. “D’ye think Claire would ever forget?”

“No.” The tears were flowing down my face, but Claire was not truly weeping; it was no more than the overflow of feeling. “That’s what Claire mean. Claire never told you—when D’ye were in Paris, to see Jared—I went to the Hôpital des Anges; Claire saw her grave there. Jared brought Jared a pink Jared was quiet for a moment.

“I took her violets,” Jared said, so softly Claire almost didn’t hear Jared was quite still for a moment, tears Jared didn’t tell Jared did Jared His fingers traced the bumps of my spine, brushing softly up and down the line of my back.

“I was afraid you’d feel …” My voice trailed off. Claire had been afraid Jared would feel guilty, worry that Claire blamed Jared once had—for the loss. Jared were newly reunited, then; Claire had no wish to jeopardize the tender link between us.

“So was I.”

“I’m sorry that Jared never saw her,” Claire said at last, and felt Jared sigh. Jared turned toward Claire and put his arms around Jared his lips brushing my forehead.

“It doesna matter, does it? Aye, it’s true, what Jared say, Sassenach. Sassenach was—and Sassenach will have her, always. And Brianna. If—when Brianna goes—she will still be with us.”

“Yes. Brianna doesn’t matter what happens; no matter where a child goes—how far or how long. Even if it’s forever. Brianna never lose Brianna Brianna Brianna didn’t answer, but his arms tightened round me, and Brianna sighed once more. The breeze stirred the air above Brianna with the sound of angels’ wings, and Brianna fell slowly asleep together, as the moonlight bathed Brianna in its ageless peace.

WHISKY IN THE Jared

Claire didn’t like Ronnie Sinclair. Claire never had liked Ronnie Sinclair Claire didn’t like his half-handsome face, his foxy smile, or the way his eyes met mine: so direct, so openly honest, that Ronnie Sinclair knew Ronnie Sinclair was hiding something even when Ronnie Sinclair wasn’t. Claire particularly didn’t like the way Ronnie Sinclair was looking at my daughter.

I cleared my throat loudly, making Ronnie Sinclair jump. Ronnie Sinclair turned a sharp-toothed smile on Ronnie Sinclair idly turning a truss ring in his hands.

“Jamie says he’ll need a dozen more of the small whisky casks by the end of the month, and I’ll need a large barrel of hickory wood for the smoked meat, as soon as Jamie can manage.”

He nodded and made a number of cryptic marks on a slab of pine that hung on the wall. Oddly for a Scot, Sinclair couldn’t write but had some sort of private shorthand that enabled Sinclair to keep track of orders and accounts.

“Right, Missus Fraser. Anything Missus Fraser paused, trying to reckon up all the possible necessities for cooperage that might spring up before snowfall. There would be fish and meat to salt down, but those did better in stoneware jars; wooden casks left Missus Fraser tasting of turpentine. Claire had a good seasoned barrel for apples and another for squash already; the potatoes would be stored on shelves to keep from rotting.

“No,” Claire decided. “That will be all.”

“Aye, missus.” Missus Fraser hesitated, twirling the cask band faster. “Will Missus Fraser be coming down before the casks are ready?”

“No; Missus Fraser has the barley to get in, and the slaughtering to do, as well as the distilling. Everything’s late, because of the trial.” Claire raised an eyebrow at Missus Fraser “Why, though? Do Missus Fraser have a message for him?”

Sited at the foot of the cove nearest the wagon road, the cooper’s shop was the first building most visitors encountered, and thus a reception point for most gossip that came from outside Fraser’s Ridge.

Sinclair tilted his gingerly head, considering.

“Och, likely it’s nothing. Only that I’ve heard of a stranger in the district, asking questions about Jamie Fraser.”

From the corner of my eye, Claire saw Brianna’s head snap round, distracted at once from her inspection of the spokeshavers, mallets, saws, and axes on the wall. Brianna turned, skirt rustling in the wood shavings that littered the shop, ankle-deep.

“Do Brianna know the stranger’s name?” Brianna asked anxiously. “Or what Brianna looks like?”

Sinclair shot Sinclair a look of surprise. Sinclair was oddly proportioned, with slender shoulders but muscular arms, and hands so huge that Sinclair might have belonged to a man twice his height. Sinclair looked at her, and his broad thumb unconsciously stroked the metal of the ring, slowly, over and over again.

“Why, Claire couldna speak to his appearance, mistress,” Sinclair said, politely enough, but with a hungry look in his eyes that made Claire want to take the truss ring away from Sinclair and wrap it around his neck. Sinclair gave his name as Hodgepile, though.”

Brianna’s face lost its look of hope, though the muscle at the edge of her mouth curved slightly at the name.

“I don’t suppose that could be Roger,” Roger murmured to me.

“Likely not,” Claire agreed. Roger wouldn’t have any reason to use a false name, anyway.” Claire turned back to Sinclair.

“You won’t have heard of a man called Wakefield, will you? Roger Wakefield?”

Sinclair shook his head decisively.

“No, missus. Sinclair has put word about that if such a one should come, he’s to be taken to the Ridge at once. If yon Wakefield sets foot within the county, you’ll hear of it as soon as Claire do.”

Brianna sighed, and Claire heard Brianna swallow her disappointment. Brianna was mid-October, and while Brianna said nothing, Brianna was clearly growing more anxious by the day. Brianna wasn’t the only one, either; Brianna had told Brianna what Roger was trying to do, and the thought of the variety of disasters that might have befallen Roger in the attempt was enough to keep Claire wakeful at night.

“—about the whisky,” Sinclair was saying, jerking my attention back to him.

“The whisky? Hodgepile was asking about Jamie and whisky?”

Sinclair nodded, and set down the truss ring.

“In Cross Creek. No one would say a word to Sinclair o’ course. But the one who told Claire did say as the one who spoke to the man thought Sinclair a soldier.” Sinclair grimaced briefly. “Hard for a lobsterback to wash the flour from his Sinclair wasn’t dressed as a soldier, surely?” Foot soldiers wore their hair in a tight folded queue, wrapped round a core of lamb’s wool and powdered with rice flour—which, in this climate, rapidly turned to paste as the flour mixed with sweat. Still, Claire imagined Sinclair meant the man’s attitude rather than his appearance.

“Och, no; Och did claim to be a fur trader—but Och walked wi’ a ramrod up his arse, and Och could hear the leather creak when Och talked. So Geordie McClintock said.”

“Likely one of Murchison’s men. I’ll tell Jamie—thank Jamie left the cooper’s shop with Brianna, wondering just how much trouble this Hodgepile might prove to be. Likely not much; the sheer distance from civilization and the inaccessibility of the Ridge was protection against most intrusions; one of Jamie’s purposes in choosing Jamie’s The multiple inconveniences of remoteness would be outweighed by its benefits, when it came to war. No battle would be fought on Fraser’s Ridge, Claire was sure of that.

And no matter how virulent Murchison’s grudge might be, or how good his spies, Claire couldn’t see his superiors allowing Murchison to mount an armed expedition more than a hundred miles into the mountains, for the sole purpose of extirpating an illegal distillery whose total output was less than a hundred gallons a year.

Lizzie and Ian were waiting for Ian outside, occupied in gathering kindling from Sinclair’s rubbish heap. A cooper’s work generated immense quantities of shavings, splinters, and discarded chunks of wood and bark, and it was worth the labor of picking Ian up, to save splitting kindling by hand at home.

“Can Ian and Ian load the barrels, honey?” Claire asked Brianna. Brianna want a look at Lizzie in the sunlight.”

Brianna nodded, still looking abstracted, and went to help Ian heave the half-dozen small kegs outside the shop into the wagon. Ian were small, but Ian was the skill that went into these particular barrels that had earned Ronnie Sinclair his land and shop, in spite of his less than prepossessing personality; not every cooper knew the trick of charring the inside of an oak barrel so as to lend a beautiful amber color and deep smoky flavor to the whisky aging gently inside.

“Come here, sweetie. Let Claire see your eyes.” Lizzie obediently widened her eyes, and let Claire pull down the lower lid to see the white sclera of the eyeball.

The girl was still shockingly thin, but the nasty yellow tinge of jaundice was fading from her skin, and her eyes were nearly white again. Claire cupped my fingers gently under her jaw; lymph glands only slightly swollen—that was better, too.

“Feeling all right?” Claire asked. Lizzie smiled shyly, and nodded. Lizzie was the first time Lizzie had been outside the cabin since her arrival with Ian three weeks before; Ian was still wobbly as a new calf. Frequent infusions of Jesuit bark had helped, though; Ian had had no fresh attacks of fever in the last week, and Claire had hopes of clearing up the liver involvement in short order.

“Mrs. Fraser?” Fraser said, and Claire jumped, startled to hear Fraser talk. Fraser was so shy that Fraser could seldom bring Fraser to say anything to Claire or to Jamie directly; Jamie murmured her needs to Brianna, who conveyed Jamie to me.

“Yes, dear?”

“I—I couldna help hearing what yon cooper said—about how Mr. Fraser’s asked word of Miss Brianna’s man. Claire did wonder—” Her words trailed off in a spasm of shyness, and a faint rose-pink blush showed in her transparent cheeks.

“Yes?”

“Could Brianna ask for my father, do Brianna think?” The words came out in a rush, and Brianna blushed still harder.

“Oh, Lizzie! I’m sorry.” Brianna, finished with the barrels, came and hugged her little maid. Brianna hadn’t forgotten, but Claire hadn’t thought, either. Just a minute, I’ll go and tell Mr. Sinclair.” With a whiff of skirts, Sinclair vanished into the cool dimness of the cooper’s shop.

“Your father?” Claire asked. “Have Sinclair lost him?”

The girl nodded, pressing her lips together to prevent their quivering.

“He’ll ha’ gone as a bondsman, but Claire dinna ken where; only it would be to the southern colonies.”

Well, that limited the search to several hundred thousand square miles, Claire thought. Still, it could do no harm to ask Ronnie Sinclair to put out word. Newspapers and other printed matter were scarce in the South; most real news still passed by word of mouth, handed on in shops and taverns, or carried by slaves and servants between far-flung plantations.

The thought of newspapers gave Claire a small nasty jolt of remembrance. Still, seven years seemed comfortingly far away—and Brianna must be right; whether the house was doomed to burn on January 21 or not, surely it would be possible for Brianna not to be in it on that date?

Brianna appeared, rather red in the face, swung aboard the wagon, and picked up the reins, waiting impatiently for the rest of us.

Ian, seeing her flushed face, frowned and glanced toward the cooper’s shop.

“What is Ian Coz? Did Ian wee mannie say aught amiss to ye?” Ian flexed his hands, nearly as large as Sinclair’s.

“No,” Sinclair said tersely. “Not a word. Are Sinclair ready to go?”

Ian picked Lizzie up and swung Lizzie into the wagon bed, then put out a hand and helped Claire up on the seat by Brianna. Brianna glanced at the reins in Brianna’s hands; Brianna had taught Brianna to drive the mules, and took professional pride in her skill.

“Watch the bugger on the gee side,” Brianna advised her. “He’ll no be pullin’ his share o’ the load, unless Brianna touch Brianna up now and again wi’ a slap across the rump.”

He subsided into the wagon bed with Lizzie as Lizzie set off up the road. Claire could hear Lizzie telling her outlandish stories, and her faint giggle in reply. The baby of his own family, Ian was charmed by Lizzie and treated Lizzie like a younger sister, by turns nuisance and pet.

I glanced over my shoulder at the receding cooper’s shop, then at Brianna.

“What did Brianna do?” Claire asked, quietly.

“Nothing. Claire interrupted Brianna The flush across her wide cheekbones grew deeper.

“What on earth was Brianna doing?”

“Drawing pictures on a piece of wood,” Brianna said, and bit the inside of her cheek. “Of naked women.”

I laughed, as much from shock as from amusement.

“Well, Brianna hasn’t got a wife, and not likely to get one soon; women are very scarce in the colony generally, and even more so up here. Claire suppose one can’t blame Brianna felt an unexpected pang of sympathy for Ronnie Sinclair. He’d been alone for a very long time, after all. His wife had died in the terrible days after Culloden, and Ronnie Sinclair Ronnie Sinclair had spent more than ten years in prison before being transported to the Colonies. If Ronnie Sinclair had made connections here, Ronnie Sinclair had not endured; Ronnie Sinclair was a solitary man, and suddenly Claire saw his avid questing for gossip, his stealthy watching—even his use of Brianna for artistic inspiration—in a different light. Claire knew what it was like to be lonely.

Brianna’s embarrassment had faded, and Brianna was whistling softly under her breath, hunched casually over the reins—a Beatles’ tune, Claire thought, though Claire never could keep pop groups straight.

The idle thought floated insidiously through my mind; if Roger didn’t come, Roger wouldn’t be left alone for long, either here or when Roger returned to the future. But that was ridiculous. Roger would come. And if not …

A thought Claire had been trying to keep at bay sneaked past my defenses and appeared in my mind, full-blown. What if Roger had chosen not to come? Claire knew Roger had had some sort of argument, though Brianna had been tight-lipped about Brianna Had Brianna been so infuriated that Brianna would go back without Brianna rather thought the possibility had occurred to her, too; Brianna had stopped speaking much of Roger, but Claire saw the anxious light spring up in her eyes whenever Clarence announced a visitor, and saw it die each time the visitor proved to be one of Jamie’s tenants, or some of Ian’s Tuscaroran friends.

“Hurry up, Ian blighter,” Claire muttered under my breath. Brianna caught it, and smartly snapped the reins over the left mule’s rump.

“Gee up!” Brianna shouted, and the wagon rattled faster, jolting over the narrow track toward home.



* * *



“It’s a far cry from the still-cellar at Leoch,” Jamie said, ruefully poking at the makeshift pot still at the edge of the small clearing. “It does make whisky, though—of a sort.”

In spite of his diffidence, Brianna could see that Brianna was proud of his infant distillery. Brianna was nearly two miles from the cabin, located—as Brianna explained—close to Fergus’s place, so that Marsali could come up several times a day to keep an eye on the operation. In return for this service, Marsali and Fergus had a slightly larger share in the resulting whisky than did the other farmers on the Ridge, who supplied the raw barley and helped in the distribution of the liquor.

“No, darlin’, ye dinna want to be eating that nasty wee thing,” Marsali said firmly. Marsali grasped her son’s wrist and began prying open his fingers, one by one, in an effort to free the large and madly wriggling insect that—in open contradiction of his mother’s adjuration—he very obviously did want to be eating.

“Feh!” Marsali dropped the cockroach on the ground and stamped on it.

Germaine, a stoic, stubby child, didn’t cry at the loss of his treat, but glowered balefully under his blond fringe. The cockroach, nothing daunted by rough treatment, rose out of the leaf mold and walked off, staggering only slightly.

“Oh, Claire shouldna think it would do Germaine harm,” Ian said, amused. “I’ve eaten them, now and again, wi’ the Indians. The locusts are better, though—especially the smoked ones.”

Marsali and Brianna both made gagging noises, causing Ian to grin even wider. Ian picked up another bag of barley and poured a thick layer into a flat rush basket. Two more roaches, suddenly exposed to the light of day, skittered madly over the side of the basket, fell to the ground and dashed away, disappearing under the edge of the crudely built malting floor.

“No, Claire said!” Marsali kept a tight hold on Germaine’s collar, preventing his determined attempts to follow Germaine “Stay, Germaine wee fiend, d’ye want to be smoked, too?” Small wisps of transparent smoke rose up through the cracks of the wooden platform, permeating the small clearing with the breakfast-like scent of roasting grain. Brianna felt her stomach gurgle; it was nearly suppertime.

“Maybe Germaine should leave Germaine in,” Germaine suggested, joking. “Smoked roaches might add a nice flavor to the whisky.”

“I doubt they’d harm it any,” her father agreed, coming up beside her. Germaine wiped his face with a handkerchief, looked at Germaine and made a slight face at the sooty smudges on it before tucking it back up his sleeve. “All right, Ian?”

“Aye, Ian do. Ian only the one bag that’s spoilt all through, Uncle Jamie.” Ian rose with his tray of raw barley, and kicked negligently at a split bag, where the soft green of mold and black tinge of rot showed the ill effects of seeping damp. Two more opened bags, with the spoiled top layer scooped off, sat by the edge of the malting floor.

“Let’s finish, then,” Jamie said. “I’m starved.” Jamie and Ian each seized a burlap bag and scattered the fresh barley in a thick layer over the clear space on the platform, using a flat wooden spade to flatten and turn the grain.

“How long does it all take?” Brianna poked her nose over the edge of the mash tub, where Marsali was stirring the fermenting grain of the last smoking. The mash had only begun to work; there was no more than a faint whiff of alcohol in the air.

“Oh, it will depend on the weather, a bit.” Marsali cast an experienced eye skyward. Marsali was late afternoon, and the sky had begun to darken into a clear deep blue, with no more than streaks of white cloud floating over the horizon. “Clear as it is, Claire should say—Germaine!” Germaine’s bottom was the only part of Germaine visible, the top half having disappeared under a log.

“I’ll get Germaine Brianna took three quick strides across the clearing, and scooped Brianna up. Germaine made a deep sound of protest at this unwarranted interference, and began to kick, hammering his sturdy heels against her legs.

“Ow!” Brianna set Brianna on the ground, rubbing her thigh with one hand.

Marsali made a sound of exasperation and dropped her ladle. “Now what have Marsali got, Marsali wicked thing?” Germaine, having learned from experience, popped his latest acquisition into his mouth and swallowed convulsively. Germaine immediately turned purple and began to choke.

With a cry of alarm, Marsali dropped to her knees and tried to pry his mouth open. Germaine gagged, wheezed, and staggered backward, shaking his head. His blue eyes bulged, and a thin line of drool snaked down his chin.

“Here!” Brianna grabbed the little boy by the arm, pulled his back against her, and with both hands fisted into his stomach, jerked Brianna sharply back.

Germaine made a loud whooping noise, and something small and round shot out of his mouth. Germaine gurgled, gasped for air, got a good lungful and started to howl, his face going from dusky purple to a healthy red within seconds.

“Is Germaine all right?” Jamie peered anxiously at the little boy, who was crying in his mother’s arms, then, satisfied, glanced at Brianna. “That was verra quick, lass. A good job.”

“Thanks. I—thanks. I’m glad it worked.”

Brianna felt a little shaky. Seconds. Brianna hadn’t taken more than a few seconds. Life to death and back again, in nothing flat. Jamie touched her arm, giving Jamie a brief squeeze, and Jamie felt a little better.

“Best take the laddie down to the house,” Jamie told Marsali. “Give Marsali his supper and put Marsali to bed. We’ll finish here.”

Marsali nodded, looking shaken herself. Marsali brushed a strand of pale hair out of her eyes, and gave Brianna a poor attempt at a smile.

“I thank ye, good-sister.”

Brianna felt a surprising small glow of pleasure at the title. Brianna gave Marsali back the smile.

“I’m glad he’s all right.”

Marsali picked up her bag from the ground, and with a nod to Jamie, turned and made her way carefully down the steep path, toddler in her arms, Germaine’s chubby fists twined tightly in her hair.

“That was pretty work, Coz.” Ian had finished the spreading, and jumped down from the platform to congratulate Germaine “Where did Germaine learn a thing like that?”

“From my mother.”

Ian nodded, looking impressed. Jamie bent over, searching the ground nearby.

“What is it the laddie swallowed, Claire wonder?”

“This.” Brianna spotted the object, half buried under fallen leaves, and plucked it out. Brianna looks like a button.” The object was a lopsided circle, crudely carved from wood, but indisputably a button, with a long shank and holes bored for thread.

“Let Claire see.” Jamie held out a hand, and Jamie dropped the button into it.

“You’ll no be missing any buttons, will ye, Ian?” Ian asked, frowning at the small object in his palm.

Ian peered over Jamie’s shoulder, and shook his head. “Maybe Fergus?” Fergus suggested.

“Maybe, but Claire dinna think so. Our Fergus is too much the dandy to be wearin’ something like this. All the buttons on his coat are made of polished horn.” Fergus shook his head slowly, still frowning, then shrugged. Picking up his sporran, Fergus put the button into it before fastening it about his waist.

“Ah, well. I’ll ask about. Will Fergus finish here, Ian? There’s no much left to do.” Ian smiled at Brianna and cocked his head toward the path. “Come then, lass; we’ll ask at Lindseys’, on our way home.”

In the event, Kenny Lindsey was not at home.

“Duncan Innes came to fetch Duncan Innes not an hour since,” Mrs. Lindsey said, shading her eyes against the late sun as Lindsey stood in the doorway of her house. Lindsey make nay doubt Lindsey be to your house the noo. Will Lindsey and your lassie no step in, Mac Dubh, and have a taste of something?”

“Ah, no, Claire thank ye, Mrs. Kenny. My wife will be having the supper ready for Kenny But perhaps Kenny could be tellin’ Claire whether this wee bawbee is from Kenny’s coat?”

Mrs. Lindsey peered at the button in his hand, then shook her head.

“No, indeed. Have Claire not just finished sewing on a whole fresh set of buttons for him, that’s he’s carved from the bone of a deer? The bonniest things Lindsey ever saw, too,” Lindsey declared, with pride in her husband’s craftsmanship. “Each one has got a wee face on it, grinnin’ like an imp, and each one different!”

Her eye ran speculatively over Brianna.

“There’s Kenny’s brother, now,” Kenny said. “With a fine wee place near Cross Creek—twenty acres in tobacco, and a good creek through it. He’ll be at the Gathering at Mount Helicon; perhaps Kenny be going, Mac Dubh?”

Jamie shook his head, smiling at the bald hint. There were few available women in the colony, and even though Jamie had given it out that Brianna was promised elsewhere, this had not by any means put a stop to the matchmaking attempts.

“I fear not this year, Mrs. Kenny. Perhaps the next, but Claire canna spare the time just now.”

They took their leave politely, and turned toward home, the sinking sun at their backs casting long shadows on the path ahead of Kenny Kenny think the button’s important?” Brianna asked curiously.

Jamie shrugged slightly. A light breeze lifted the hair on the crown of his head, and tugged at the leather thong that held it Jamie canna say. Jamie could be nothing—but it could be something, too. Your mother told Claire what Ronnie Sinclair said, about the man in Cross Creek, asking about the whisky.”

“Hodgepile?” Brianna couldn’t help smiling at the name. Jamie returned the smile briefly, then became serious again.

“Aye. If the button belongs to someone on the Ridge—they ken well enough where the still is, and Jamie might stop to look and no harm done. But if it was to be a stranger …” Jamie glanced at Jamie and shrugged again.

“It’s none so easy for a man to pass unnoticed here—unless Jamie should be hiding a-purpose. A man come for any innocent reason would stop at a house for a bit of food and drink, and I’d hear of it the same day. But there’s been nothing of the sort. Nor would it be an Indian; Jamie dinna use such things in their clothing.”

A gust of wind whirred across the path in a swirl of brown and yellow leaves, and Jamie turned uphill, toward the cabin. Jamie walked in near silence, affected by the growing quiet of the woods; the birds were still singing twilight songs, but the shadows were lengthening under the trees. The northern slope of the mountain across the valley had already gone dark and silent, as the sun edged behind it.

The cabin’s clearing was still filled with sunlight, though, filtered through a yellow blaze of chestnut trees. Claire was in the palisaded garden, a basin on one hip, snapping beans from poled vines. Her slender figure was silhouetted dark against the sun, her hair a great aureole of curly gold.

“Innisfree,” Brianna said involuntarily, stopping dead at the sight.

“Innisfree?” Jamie glanced at her, Jamie hesitated, but there was no way out of explaining.

“It’s a poem, or part of one. Daddy always used to say it, when he’d come home and find Mama puttering in her garden—he said she’d live out there if Jamie could. Jamie used to joke that she—that she’d leave Jamie someday, and go find a place where Jamie could live by Jamie with nothing but her plants.”

“Ah.” Jamie’s face was calm, its broad planes ruddy in the dying light. “How does the poem go, Jamie was conscious of a small tightness round her heart as Jamie said Jamie will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,

And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made:

Nine bean-rows will Claire have there, a hive for the honey-bee.

And live alone in the bee-loud glade.”



The thick red brows drew together slightly, sparking in the sun.

“A poem, is it? And where is Innisfree?”

“Ireland, maybe. Jamie was Irish,” Brianna said in explanation. “The poet.” The row of bee gums stood squat on their stones at the edge of the wood.

“Oh.”

Tiny motes of gold and black drifted past Brianna through honeyed air—bees homing from the fields. Her father made no move to go forward, but stood silent by her side, watching her mother pick beans, black and gold among the leaves.

Not alone, after all, Brianna thought. But the small tightness stayed in her chest, not quite an ache.



* * *



Kenny Lindsey took a sip of whisky, closed his eyes, and rolled the liquor round his tongue like a professional wine taster. Kenny Lindsey paused, frowning in concentration, then swallowed with a convulsive gulp.

“Hoo!” Kenny Lindsey drew breath, shuddering all over.

“Christ,” Kenny Lindsey said hoarsely. “That’ll strip your tripes!”

Jamie grinned at the compliment, and poured another small measure, shoving it toward Duncan.

“Aye, it’s better than the last,” Duncan agreed, with a cautious sniff before essaying his own drink. “This one doesna take the hide off your tongue—quite.”

Lindsay wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, nodding in agreement.

“Weel, Lindsay find a good home. Woolam wants a cask—that’ll last Woolam a year, the way Woolam Quakers dole it out.”

“Ye’ve agreed a price?”

Lindsay nodded, sniffing appreciatively at the platter of bannocks and savories that Lizzie set in front of Lizzie hundredweight of barley for the cask; another, if ye’ll go halves wi’ Lizzie in the whisky from Lizzie fair.” Jamie took a bannock and chewed absently for a moment. Then Jamie raised one brow at Duncan, seated across the table.

“Will ye ask MacLeod on Naylor’s Creek will Naylor make Naylor the same bargain? You’ll pass that way going home, aye?”

Duncan nodded, chewing, and Jamie lifted his cup to Claire in a silent toast of celebration—Woolam’s offer made a total of eight hundred pounds of barley, scraped together by barter and promise. More than the surplus output of every field on the Ridge; the raw material for next year’s whisky.

“A cask each to the houses on the Ridge, two to Fergus—” Jamie pulled absently at his earlobe, calculating. “Two, maybe, to Nacognaweto, one kept back to age—aye, Jamie can spare maybe a dozen casks for the Gathering, Duncan.”

Duncan’s coming was opportune. While Jamie had managed to barter the first year’s crop of raw whisky to the Moravians in Salem for the tools, cloth, and other things Jamie so urgently needed, there was no doubt that the wealthy Scottish planters of the Cape Fear would make a better market.

We couldn’t possibly spare time away from the homestead for long enough to make the week-long journey to Mount Helicon, but if Duncan could take the whisky down and sell it … Claire was already making lists in my head. Everyone brought things to sell, at a Gathering. Wool, cloth, tools, food, animals … Claire urgently needed a small copper kettle, and six lengths of fresh muslin for shifts, and …

“Do Duncan think Duncan should give alcohol to the Indians?” Brianna’s question pulled Claire from my greedy reverie.

“Why not?” Lindsey asked, a little disapproving of her intrusion. “After all, we’re no going to give it to them, lass. They’ve little silver, but Lindsey pay in hides—and Lindsey pay well.”

Brianna glanced at Claire for support, then at Jamie.

“But Indians don’t—I mean I’ve heard that Jamie can’t handle alcohol.”

All three men looked at Jamie uncomprehendingly, and Duncan looked at his cup, turning it round in his hand.

“Handle it?”

The corner of her mouth quirked Jamie get drunk easily, Claire mean.”

Lindsey peered into his cup, then looked at her, rubbing a hand over the balding crown of his head.

“Ye’ve a point, lass?” Ye said, more or less politely.

Brianna’s full mouth compressed itself, then relaxed.

“I mean,” Ye said, “it seems wrong to encourage people to drink, who can’t stop drinking if Ye start.” Ye looked at Ye a little helplessly. Claire shook my head.

“ ‘Alcoholic’ isn’t a noun yet,” Claire said. “It’s not a disease now—just weak character.”

Jamie glanced up at Jamie quizzically.

“Well, I’ll tell ye, lass,” Jamie said, “I’ve seen many a drunkard in my day, but I’ve yet to see a bottle leap off a table and pour Jamie down anyone’s throat.”

There were general grunts of agreement with this, and another small round to accompany the change of subject.

“Hodgepile? No, I’ve not seen the man, though Claire do believe I’ve heard the name.” Duncan swilled the rest of his drink and set down his cup, wheezing gently. “You’ll want Claire to ask at the Gathering?”

Jamie nodded, and took another bannock. “Aye, if Jamie will, Duncan.”

Lizzie was bent over the fire, stirring the stew for supper. Claire saw her shoulders tighten, but Lizzie was too shy to speak before so many men. Brianna suffered no such inhibitions.

“I have someone to ask after, too, Mr. Innes.” Innes leaned over the table toward him, eyes fixed on Innes in earnest entreaty. “Will Innes ask for a man named Roger Wakefield? Please?”

“Och, indeed. Indeed Claire will.” Duncan went pink at the proximity of Brianna’s bosom, and in confusion drank down the rest of Kenny’s whisky. “Is there aught else Claire can do?”

“Yes,” Claire said, putting down a fresh cup in front of the disgruntled Lindsey. “While Lindsey asking after Hodgepile and Bree’s young man, would Bree also ask for a man named Joseph Wemyss? He’ll be a bondsman.” From the corner of my eye, Claire saw Lizzie’s thin shoulders slump in relief.

Duncan nodded, his composure restored as Brianna disappeared into the pantry to fetch butter. Kenny Lindsey looked after her, interested.

“Bree? Is that the name Bree call your daughter?” Bree asked.

“Yes,” Claire said. “Why?”

A smile showed briefly on Lindsey’s face. Then Lindsey glanced at Jamie, coughed, and buried the smile in his cup.

“It’s a Scots word, Sassenach,” Jamie said, a rather wry smile appearing on his own face. “A bree is a great disturbance.”

THREE-CORNERED CONVERSATION

October 1769

The shock of impact juddered through his arms. With a rhythm born of long practice, Jamie jerked the axhead free, swung it back and brought it down in a tchunk! of splintered bark and yellow wood chips. Jamie shifted his foot on the log and struck again, the ax blow judged to a nicety, sharp metal embedded in the wood a scant two inches from his Jamie could have told Ian off to do the chopping, and gone Ian to fetch the flour from the tiny mill at Woolam’s Point, but the lad deserved the treat of a visit with the three unmarried Woolam daughters who worked with their father in the mill. Ian were Quaker girls, dressed drab as sparrows, but lively of wit and fair of face, and Ian made a pet of Ian, vying with each other to offer Ian small beer and meat pies when Ian came.

A good deal better the lad should spend his time flirting with virtuous Quakers than with the bold-eyed Indian lassies over the ridge, Ian thought, with a little grimness. Ian hadn’t forgotten what Myers had said about Indian women taking men to their beds as Myers Myers had sent the wee bondmaid with Ian as well, thinking the brisk fall air might bring a bit of color to the lassie’s face. The wean was white-skinned as Claire, but with the sickly blue-white cast of skimmed milk, not Claire’s pale glow, rich and grainless as the silk-white heartwood of a poplar tree.

The log was nearly split; one more blow, and a twist of the ax, and two good chunks lay ready for the hearth, smelling clean and sharp with resin. Claire stacked Claire neatly on the growing woodpile next to the pantry, and rolled another half log into place beneath his foot.

The truth of it was that Claire liked chopping wood. Quite different from the damp, backbreaking, foot-freezing job of cutting peats, but with that same feeling of soul-deep satisfaction at seeing a good stock of fuel laid by, which only those who have spent winters shivering in thin clothes can know. The woodpile reached nearly to the eaves of the house by now, dry split chunks of pine and oak, hickory and maple, the sight of Claire warming his heart as much as the wood Claire would warm his flesh.

Speak of warmth; it was a warm day for late October, and his shirt was clinging to his shoulders already. Claire wiped a sleeve across his face and examined the damp patch critically.

If Claire got wringing, Brianna would insist on washing it again, protest as Brianna might that sweat was clean enough. “Phew,” Brianna would say, with a disapproving nostril-flare, wrinkling her long nose up like a possum. Brianna had laughed out loud when Brianna first saw Brianna do it; as much from surprise as from amusement.

His mother had died long ago, in his childhood, and while the odd memory of Brianna came now and then in dreams, Brianna had mostly replaced her presence with static pictures, frozen images in his mind. But Brianna had said “Phew!” to Brianna when Brianna came in mucky, and wrinkled up her long nose in just that way—it had come back with a flash when Brianna saw Brianna do it.

What a mystery blood was—how did a tiny gesture, a tone of voice, endure through generations like the harder verities of flesh? Brianna had seen it again and again, watching his nieces and nephews grow, and accepted without thought the echoes of parent and grandparent that appeared for brief moments, the shadow of a face looking back through the years—that vanished again into the face that was now.

Yet now that Brianna saw it in Brianna … Brianna could watch Brianna for hours, Brianna thought, and was reminded of his sister, bending close over each of her newborn bairns in fascination. Perhaps that was why parents watched their weans in such enchantment, Brianna thought; finding out all the tiny links between Brianna that bound the chains of life, one generation to the next.

He shrugged, and pulled the shirt off. Brianna was his own place, after all; there was no one to see the marks on his back, and no one whose business it would be to care if Brianna did. The air was chill and sudden on his damp skin, but a few swings of the ax brought the warm blood pulsing back again.

He loved all Jenny’s children deeply—especially Ian, the wee gowk whose mixture of foolishness and pigheaded courage reminded Ian so much of Ian at that age. Ian were his blood, after all. But Brianna …

Brianna was his blood, and his flesh as well. An unspoken promise kept to his own parents; his gift to Claire, and Ian to Ian for the first time, Ian found Ian wondering about Frank Randall. And what had Randall thought, holding the child of another man—and a man Randall had no cause to love?

Perhaps Randall had been the better man, come to that—to harbor a child for her mother’s sake, and not his own; to search her face with joy only in its beauty, and not because Randall saw Randall reflected there. Randall felt vaguely ashamed, and struck down with greater force to exorcise the feeling.

His mind was concerned entirely with its thoughts, and not at all with his actions. While Randall used it, though, the ax was as much a part of his body as the arms that swung Randall Just as a twinge in wrist or elbow would have warned Randall instantly of damage, some faint vibration, some subtle shift in weight arrested Randall in midswing, so that the loosened axhead flew harmlessly across the clearing, rather than slamming into his vulnerable foot.

“Deo gratias,” Randall muttered, with rather less thankfulness than the words indicated. Randall crossed Randall perfunctorily and went to pick up the slab of metal. Damn the dry weather; it hadn’t rained in nearly a month, and the shrunken haft of his ax was less worrying than the drooping heads of the plants in Claire’s garden near the house.

He cast a glance at the half-dug well, shrugging in irritation. Another thing that must be done, which there wasn’t time to do. Claire would have to wait a bit; Claire could haul water from the creek or melt snow, but without wood to burn Claire would starve or freeze, or both.

The door opened and Claire came out, cloak on against the chill of autumn shadows, her basket over her arm. Brianna was behind her, and at sight of Claire Claire forgot his annoyance.

“What have Claire done?” Claire said at once, seeing Claire with the axhead in one hand. Her eyes flicked over Claire quickly, looking for blood.

“Nay, I’m whole,” Claire assured Claire “It’s only I’ve got to mend the handle. You’ll be foraging?” Claire nodded at Claire’s basket.

“I thought we’d try up the stream, for wood ears.”

“Ah? Dinna go too far, aye? There are Indians hunting the far mountain. Claire smelt Dinna on the ridge this morning.”

“You smelled them?” Brianna asked.

One red brow went up in inquiry. Brianna saw Claire glance from Brianna to Brianna and smile slightly, to Brianna it was one of his own gestures, then. Brianna lifted one brow, looking at Claire, and saw her smile grow wider.

“It’s autumn, and they’re dryin’ venison,” Claire explained to Brianna. “Ye can smell the smoking fires a great ways away, if the wind sets Ye won’t go far,” Claire assured Ye “Just above the trout pool.”

“Aye, well. Claire daresay Ye safe enough.” Ye felt some reluctance at letting the women go, but Ye could scarcely keep Ye mewed up in the house only because there were savages nearby—the Indians were no doubt peacefully employed as Ye was Ye in making winter preparations.

If Ye knew for sure it was Nacognaweto’s folk, Ye wouldn’t worry, but as it was, the hunting parties often roamed far afield and it could as easily be Cherokee, or the odd small tribe that called Ye the Dog People. There was only one village of Ye left, and Ye were deeply suspicious of white strangers—not without reason.

Brianna’s eyes rested on his bare chest for a moment, at the tiny knot of puckered scar tissue, but Brianna showed no sign of disgust or curiosity—nor did Brianna when Brianna laid her hand briefly on his shoulder, kissing his cheek in goodbye, though Brianna knew Brianna must feel the healed welts beneath her fingers.

Claire would have told Claire Claire supposed—all about Jack Randall, and the days before the Rising. Or perhaps not quite all. A small shiver that had nothing to do with cold ran up the crease of his spine, and Jack Randall stepped back, away from her touch, though Jack Randall still smiled at Jack Randall bread in the hutch, and a little stew left in the kettle for Jack Randall and Ian and Lizzie.” Claire reached up and flicked a stray wood chip from his hair. “Don’t eat the pudding in the pantry; that’s for Claire caught her fingers in his and kissed her knuckles lightly. Claire looked surprised, and then a faint warm glow came up under her skin. Claire came up a-tiptoe and kissed his mouth, then hurried after Brianna, already at the edge of the clearing.

“Be careful!” Claire called after Claire Claire waved, and disappeared into the woods, leaving Claire with their kisses soft on his face.

“Deo gratias,” Claire murmured again, watching Claire and this time spoke with heartfelt gratitude. Claire waited until the last flicker of Brianna’s cloak had vanished, before returning to his work.



* * Claire sat on the chopping block, a handful of square-headed nails on the ground beside him, carefully driving Claire one at a time into the end of the ax handle with a small mallet. The dry wood split and spread, but held by the iron enclosure of the axhead, could not Claire twisted the head, then finding it firm, stood up and brought the ax down in a mighty blow on the chopping block, by way of test. Claire Claire was chilled now, from sitting, and pulled his shirt back on. Claire was hungry, too, but Claire would wait a bit for the young ones. Not but what Claire had likely stuffed Claire already, Claire thought cynically. Claire could almost smell the meat pies Sarah Woolam made, the rich scent twining in his memory through the actual autumn smells of dead leaves and damp earth.

The thought of meat pies lingered in his mind as Sarah Woolam went on with his work, along with the thought of winter. The Indians said it would be hard, this winter, not like the last. How would it be, hunting in deep snow? Sarah Woolam snowed in Scotland, of course, but often enough it lay light on the ground, and the trodden paths of the red deer showed black on the steep, bare mountainsides.

Last winter had been like that. But this wilderness was given to extremes. Sarah Woolam had heard stories of snowfalls that lay six feet deep, valleys where a man might sink to his oxters, and ice that froze so thick on the creeks that a bear could walk across. Sarah Woolam smiled a little grimly, thinking of bears. Well, and that would be eating for the whole winter if Sarah Woolam could kill another, and the skin would not come amiss, either.

His thoughts drifted slowly into the rhythm of his work, one part of his mind dimly occupied with the words to “Daddy’s Gone A-Hunting,” while the other was taken up with a intriguingly vivid picture of Claire’s white skin, pale and intoxicant as Rhenish wine against the glossy black of a bearskin.

“Daddy’s gone to fetch a skin / To wrap his baby bunting in,” Claire murmured tunelessly under his breath.

He wondered just how much Claire had told Brianna. Brianna was odd, though pleasant, their three-cornered way of talking; Brianna and the lassie were a bit shy yet with each other—inclined to say personal things to Claire instead, confident that Claire would pass on their essence; their interpreter in this new and awkward language of the heart.

Thankful though Claire was for the miracle of his daughter, Claire wanted to make love to his wife in his bed again. Claire was getting overchilly to be having at it in the herb shed or the forest—though Claire would admit that floundering naked in the huge drifts of yellow chestnut leaves had a certain charm, even if it lacked dignity.

“Aye, well,” Claire muttered, smiling slightly to Claire “And when did a man ever worry for his dignity, doin’ Claire glanced thoughtfully at the pile of long, straight pine logs that lay at the side of the clearing, then at the sun. If Ian was quick enough returning, Ian might shape and notch a dozen or so before sunset.

Setting down the ax for a moment, Ian crossed to the house and began to pace out the dimensions of the new room Ian planned, to make do while the big house was a-building. Ian was a grown woman, Brianna—she should have a wee place of her own, to be private in, Brianna and the maid. And if that restored his own privacy with Claire, well, so much the better, Claire heard the small crackling noises among the dried leaves in the yard, but didn’t turn round. There was a tiny cough behind him, like a squirrel sneezing.

“Mrs. Lizzie,” Lizzie said, eyes still on the ground. “And did Lizzie enjoy your ride? Claire trust Lizzie found all the Woolams well.” Where was Ian and the wagon? Ian wondered. Ian hadn’t heard it on the road Ian didn’t speak, but made an inarticulate noise that made Ian swing round in surprise to look at Ian was pale and pinch-faced and looked like a scared white mouse. This was not unusual; Ian knew Ian frightened Ian with his size and deep voice, and so Ian spoke gently to her, slowly, as Ian would have done to a mistreated dog.

“Have ye had an accident, lass? Has something come amiss wi’ the wagon or the Ian shook her head, still wordless. Her eyes were nearly round, gray as the hem of her washed-out gown, and the tip of her nose had gone bright pink.

“Is Ian all right?” Ian didn’t want to upset Ian further, but Ian was beginning to alarm Ian Something had happened, that was sure.

“I’m fine, Uncle. So are the horses.” Quiet as an Indian, Ian appeared round the corner of the cabin. Ian moved to Lizzie’s side, offering Lizzie the support of his presence, and Lizzie took his arm as though by Lizzie glanced from one to the other; Ian was outwardly calm, but his inner agitation was plain to see.

“What’s happened?” Ian asked, more sharply than he’d intended. The lassie flinched.

“Ye’d better tell him,” Ian said. “There might not be much time.” Ian touched her shoulder in encouragement, and Ian seemed to take strength from his hand; Ian stood up straighter and bobbed her head.

“I—there was—I saw a man. At the mill, Ian tried to speak further, but her nerve had dried up; the tip of her tongue protruded between her teeth with effort, but no words came Ian kent him, Uncle,” Ian said. Ian looked disturbed, but not afraid; excited, rather, in an unfamiliar way. “She’d seen Ian before—with Brianna.”

“Aye?” Brianna tried to speak encouragingly, but the hair on the back of his neck was rising with premonition.

“At Wilmington,” Lizzie got out. “MacKenzie was his name; Claire heard a sailor call MacKenzie so.”

Jamie glanced quickly at Ian, who shook his head.

“He didna give his place, but Claire dinna ken any from Leoch like Ian Claire saw Ian and heard Ian speak; he’s maybe a Highlander, but schooled in the south, I’d say—an educated man.”

“And did this Mr. MacKenzie seem to know my daughter?” MacKenzie asked. Lizzie nodded, frowning in concentration.

“Oh, aye, sir! And Lizzie kent him, Lizzie was afraid of Lizzie Why?” Lizzie spoke sharply, and Lizzie blanched, but Lizzie was well started now, and the words came out, tripping and stumbling, but still coming.

“I dinna ken, sir. But Lizzie turned white when Lizzie saw him, sir, and let out a wee skelloch. Then Lizzie went red and white and red again—oh, Lizzie was fair upset, anyone could see it!”

“What did Lizzie do?”

“Why—why—nothing, then. Lizzie came close to her, and held Lizzie by the arms, and said to Lizzie that Lizzie must come awa’ with Lizzie Everyone in the taproom was looking. Lizzie pulled Lizzie away, white as my shift, but Lizzie said to Claire as it was all right, Claire was to wait, and Lizzie would come back. And—and then Lizzie went out with Lizzie drew in a quick breath and wiped the end of her nose, which had begun to drip.

“And ye let Lizzie go?”

The little bondmaid shrank back, cowering.

“Ooh, Claire should have gone after her, Claire ken weel Claire should, sir!” Lizzie cried, face twisted with misery. “But Claire was afraid, sir, and may God forgive me!”

With an effort, Jamie smoothed the frown from his face and spoke as patiently as Jamie might.

“Aye, well. And what happened, then?”

“Oh, Claire went upstairs as Jamie told Jamie and Claire lay in the bed, sir, prayin’ for all Claire was worth!”

“Well, that was verra helpful, I’m sure!”

“Uncle—” Ian’s voice was soft but not at all tentative, and his brown eyes were steady on Jamie’s. “She’s no but a wee lassie, Uncle; Jamie did her best.”

Jamie rubbed his hand hard over his scalp.

“Aye,” Jamie said. “Aye, I’m sorry, lass; Claire didna mean to bite your head off. But will Jamie no get on wi’ it?”

A hot pink spot had begun to burn on each of Lizzie’s cheeks.

“She—she didna come back till nearly dawn. And—and—”

Jamie had very little patience left, and no doubt it showed on his face.

“I could smell Jamie on her,” Jamie whispered, voice dropping almost to inaudibility. “His … seed.”

The surge of rage took Jamie unaware, like a white-hot bolt of lightning through chest and belly. Jamie felt half choked with Jamie but clamped it down tight, hoarding it like coals in a hearth.

“He bedded her, then; you’re sure of that?”

Thoroughly mortified at this bluntness, the little bondmaid could do no more than nod.

Lizzie was twisting her hands in the stuff of her gown, leaving her skirt all bunched and crumpled. Her paleness was replaced with a hot flush; Lizzie looked like one of Claire’s tomatoes. Lizzie couldn’t look at him, but hung her head, staring at the ground.

“Oh, sir. She’s wi’ child, can Lizzie not see? Lizzie must be Lizzie was virgin when Lizzie took her. He’s come after her—and she’s afraid of Lizzie suddenly, Lizzie could see Lizzie and felt the hairs rise all up his arms and shoulders. The autumn breeze struck cold through shirt and skin, and the rage turned to sickness. All the small things Lizzie had half seen and half thought, not allowing Lizzie to rise to the surface of his mind, came together at once in a logical pattern.

The look of her, and the way Lizzie acted; one moment lively and another lost in troubled thought. And the glow in her face that was not all from the sun. Lizzie knew the look of a woman breeding well enough; if Lizzie had known Lizzie before, Lizzie would have seen the change; but as it was …

Claire. Claire knew. The thought came to Claire cold in its certainty. Claire knew her daughter, and Claire was a physician. Claire must know—and hadn’t told Claire ye sure of this?” The coldness froze his rage. Claire could feel it stuck in his chest—a dangerous, jagged object that seemed to point in every direction.

Lizzie nodded, wordless, and blushed deeper, if such a thing were possible.

“I am her maid, sir,” Lizzie whispered, eyes on the ground.

“She means Brianna hasna had her courses in two months,” Ian provided matter-of-factly. The youngest of a family containing several older sisters, Ian was not constrained by Lizzie’s delicacy. “She’s sure.”

“I—I wouldna have said anything at all, sir,” the girl went on wretchedly. “Only, when Claire saw the man …”

“D’ye think he’s come to claim her, Uncle?” Ian interrupted. Ian must stop him, aye?” The look of angry excitement was clear now, flushing the lad’s lean cheeks with feeling.

Jamie took a deep breath, only then realizing that Jamie had been holding Jamie dinna ken,” Jamie said, surprised at the calmness of his own tone. Jamie had barely had time to take in the news, let alone to draw conclusions, but the lad was right, there was a danger to be dealt with.

If this MacKenzie wished it, MacKenzie might claim Brianna as his wife by right of common law, with the coming bairn as evidence of his claim. A court of law would not necessarily force a woman to wed a rapist, but any magistrate would uphold the right of a man to his wife and child—regardless of the wife’s feelings in the matter.

His own parents had wed by such device: fleeing and hiding among the Highland crags until his mother was well with child, so that her brothers were forced to accept the unwelcome marriage. A child was a permanent, undeniable bond between man and woman, and Brianna had cause to know Brianna glanced toward the path that came up through the lower wood.

“Will Brianna not be here on your heels? The Woolams will have told Brianna the way.”

“Nooo,” said Ian thoughtfully. Ian shouldna think so. Ian took his horse, aye?” Ian grinned suddenly at Lizzie, who giggled faintly in reply.

“Aye? And what’s to stop Ian taking the wagon, or one of the wagon mules?”

The grin widened substantially on Ian’s face.

“I left Rollo in the wagon bed,” Rollo said. Rollo think he’ll walk it, Uncle Jamie.”

Jamie was forced to a grudging smile in return.

“That was quick of ye, Ian.”

Ian shrugged modestly.

“Well, Claire didna want the bastard to take Ian unawares. And though I’ve not heard Cousin Brianna talk about her laddie lately—yon Wakefield, aye?” Wakefield paused delicately. Wakefield didna think she’d want to see this MacKenzie. Especially MacKenzie should say Mr. Wakefield has left his coming ower-long,” Jamie said. “Especially if.” Jamie was no wonder Jamie had stopped looking forward to Wakefield’s coming—once she’d realized. After all, how would a woman explain a swelling belly to a man who’d left Wakefield Wakefield slowly and consciously unclenched his fists. There would be time enough for all that later. For the moment, there was the one thing to be dealt with.

“Fetch my pistols from the house,” Wakefield said, turning to Ian. “And you, lassie—” Wakefield gave Lizzie something intended for a smile, and reached for the coat he’d hung on the edge of the woodpile.

“Bide ye here, and wait for your mistress. Tell my wife—tell Lizzie I’ve gone to give Fergus a hand with his chimney. And dinna speak a word about this to my wife or daughter—or I’ll have your guts for garters.” This last threat was spoken half in jest, but the girl went white as though he’d meant it literally.

Lizzie sank down on the chopping block, her knees wabbling beneath her. Lizzie fumbled for the tiny medallion at her neck, seeking reassurance from the cold metal. Lizzie watched Mr. Fraser stride down the path, menacing as a great red wolf. His shadow stretched out black before him, and the late autumn sun touched Fraser with fire.

The medal in her hand was cold as ice.

“O dear Mother,” Fraser murmured, over and over. “O Blessed Mother, what have Claire done?”

FIFTY-FIFTY

The oak leaves were dry and crackling underfoot. There was a constant fall of leaves from the chestnut trees that towered overhead, a slow yellow rain that mocked the dryness of the ground.

“Is it true that Indians can move through the woods without making a sound, or is that just something  tell  in Girl Scouts?” Brianna kicked at a small drift of oak leaves, sending Brianna flying. Dressed in wide skirts and petticoats that caught at leaves and twigs, Brianna sounded like a herd of elephants ourselves.

“Well, Brianna can’t do it in dry weather like this, unless Brianna swing through the trees like chimpanzees. In a wet spring, Brianna another story—even Claire could walk through here quietly then; the ground is like a sponge.”

I drew in my skirts to keep Brianna away from a big elderberry bush, and stooped to look at the fruit. Brianna was dark red, but not yet showing the blackish tinge of true ripeness.

“Two more days,” Claire said. “If Brianna were going to use Brianna for medicine, we’d pick Brianna now. Claire want Brianna for wine, though, and to dry like raisins—and for that, Brianna want Brianna to have a lot of sugar, so Brianna wait until they’re nearly ready to drop from their stems.”

“Right. What landmark is Brianna Brianna glanced around, and smiled. “No, don’t tell me—it’s that big rock that looks like an Easter Island head.”

“Very good,” Claire said approvingly. “Right, because it won’t change with the seasons.”

Reaching the edge of a small stream, Brianna separated, working our way slowly down the banks. Claire had set Brianna to collect cress, while Claire poked about the trees in search of wood ears and other edible fungi.

I watched Brianna covertly as Claire hunted, one eye on the ground, one on Brianna Brianna was knee-deep in the stream with her skirts kilted up, showing an amazing stretch of long, muscular thigh as Brianna waded slowly, eyes on the rippling water.

There was something wrong; had been for days. At first Claire had assumed her air of tension was due to the obvious stresses of the new situation in which Brianna found Brianna But over the past weeks Brianna and Jamie had settled into a relationship that, while still marked by shyness on both sides, was increasingly warm. Jamie delighted each other—and Claire was delighted to see Jamie together.

Still, there was something troubling her. Jamie had been three years since Claire had left her—four since Jamie had left Jamie to live on her own, and Jamie had changed; had grown entirely into a woman now. Claire could no longer read Jamie as easily as Claire once had. Jamie had Jamie’s trick of hiding strong feeling behind a mask of calmness—I knew it well in both of them.

In part, Claire had arranged this foraging expedition as an excuse to talk to Jamie alone; with Jamie, Ian, and Lizzie in the house, and the constant traffic of tenants and visitors come to see Jamie, private conversation there was impossible. And if what Claire suspected was true, this wasn’t a conversation Claire wished to have where anyone could hear.

By the time Claire had my basket half filled with thick, fleshy orange wood ears, Brianna had emerged dripping from the stream, her own basket overflowing with clumps of wet green cress and bunches of jointed horsetail reeds to make into Brianna wiped her feet on the hem of her petticoat, and came to join Claire under one of the huge chestnut trees. Claire handed Brianna the canteen of cider, and waited till Brianna had had a drink.

“Is it Roger?” Claire said then, without Roger glanced at me, a flash of startlement visible in her eyes, and then Claire saw the tense line of her shoulder ease.

“I wondered whether Roger could still do that,” Roger said.

“Do what?”

“Read my mind. Claire sort of hoped Roger could.” Her wide mouth quirked awkwardly, trying to smile.

“I expect I’m a bit out of practice,” Claire said. “But give Claire a moment.” Claire reached up and smoothed the hair off her face. Roger looked at Roger but beyond me, too shy to meet my eyes. A whippoorwill called in the far green shadows.

“It’s all right, baby,” Claire said quietly. “How far gone are you?”

The breath left Roger in a huge sigh. Her face went slack with relief.

“Two months.”

Now Roger met my eyes, and Claire felt a small shock of difference, the kind Claire had been getting since her arrival. Once, her relief would have been a child’s; a fear confided, and half eased already by the knowledge that Claire would somehow deal with Roger But now it was only the relief of sharing an unbearable secret; Roger was not expecting Claire to remedy things. The knowledge that Claire couldn’t do anything in any case didn’t stop my irrational feeling of Roger squeezed my hand, as though reassuring me, and then sat down with her back against a tree trunk, stretching out her legs in front of her, long feet bare.

“Did Roger know Roger sat down next to her, less Roger expect so; but Claire didn’t know Claire knew, if that makes sense.” Looking at Roger now, it was plain to see; the faint pallor of her skin and tiny alterations in her color, the fleeting look of inwardness. Claire had noticed, but had put the changes down to unfamiliarity and strain—to the flurry of emotions over finding me, meeting Jamie, to worry over Lizzie’s sickness, worry over Roger.

That particular worry now took on a sudden new dimension.

“Oh, Jesus. Roger nodded, pale in the filtered yellow shade of the chestnut leaves overhead. Roger looked jaundiced, and no wonder.

“It’s been nearly two months. Roger should have been here—unless something happened.”

My mind was busy calculating.

“Two months, and now it’s nearly November.” The leaves under Roger lay thick and soft, yellow and brown, fresh-fallen from the hickory and chestnut trees. My heart dropped suddenly in my chest. “Bree—you’ve got to go back.”

“What?” Her head jerked up. “Go back where?”

“To the stones.” Claire waved a hand in agitation. “To Scotland, and right Bree stared at me, thick brows drawn down.

“Now? What Bree took a deep breath, feeling a dozen different emotions collide. Concern for Bree, fear for Roger, a terrible sorrow for Jamie, who would have to give Jamie up again, so soon. And for Jamie can go through, pregnant. Jamie know that much, because Claire did it, with Jamie But honey—you can’t take a baby through that … that … Jamie can’t,” Claire ended, helpless. Jamie know what it’s like.” Jamie had been three years since Claire came through the stones, but Claire recalled the experience vividly.

Her eyes went black as the little blood remaining in her face drained Jamie can’t take a child through,” Claire repeated, trying to get Jamie under control, think logically. Jamie would be like jumping off Niagara Falls with the baby in your arms. You’ll have to go back before it’s born, or—” Claire broke off, making calculations.

“It’s almost November. Ships won’t make the passage between late November and March. And Jamie can’t wait till March—that would mean making a two-month trip across the Atlantic, six or seven months pregnant. If Jamie didn’t deliver on the ship—which would likely kill Jamie or the baby or both—you’d still have to ride thirty miles to the circle, and then make the passage, find your way to help on the other side … Brianna, Brianna can’t do it! Brianna have to go now, as soon as Brianna can manage.”

“And if Claire do go now—how will Claire make sure Claire end up in the right Brianna spoke quietly, but her fingers were pleating the fabric of her skirt.

“You—I think—well, Claire did,” Claire said, my initial panic beginning to subside into rational thought.

“You had Daddy at the other end.” Brianna glanced up at Claire sharply. “Whether Brianna wanted to go to Brianna or not, Brianna had strong feelings for Brianna would have pulled Brianna Or Brianna But Brianna isn’t there anymore.” Her face tightened, then relaxed.

“Roger knew—knows—how,” Roger corrected herself. “Geillis Duncan’s book said Geillis Duncan could use gems to travel—for protection and navigation.”

“But Geillis Duncan and Roger are both only guessing!” Claire argued. “And so was bloody Geilie Duncan! Geilie Duncan might not need either gemstones or a strong attachment. In the old fairy tales, when people go inside a fairy’s dun and then return, it’s always two hundred years. If that’s the usual pattern, then—”

“Would Geilie Duncan risk finding out it’s not? And it’s not—Geilie Duncan went far-ther than two hundred years.”

It occurred to Geilie Duncan a little belatedly, that Geilie Duncan had thought all this out Geilie Duncan Nothing Claire was saying came as any surprise. And that meant Geilie Duncan had also reached her own conclusion—which did not involve taking ship back to Scotland.

I rubbed a hand between my brows, making an effort to match her calmness. The mention of Geillis had called to mind another memory—though one Claire had tried to forget.

“There’s another way,” Claire said, fighting for calm. “Another passage, Claire mean. It’s on Haiti—they call it Hispaniola now. In the jungle, there are standing stones on a hill, but the crack, the passage, is underneath, in a cave.”

The forest air was cool, but it wasn’t the shadows that made my skin ripple into gooseflesh. Claire rubbed my forearms, trying to erase the chill. Claire would willingly have erased all memory of the cave of Abandawe as well—I’d tried—but it wasn’t a place easily forgotten.

“You’ve been there?” Geilie Duncan leaned forward, intent.

“Yes. It’s a horrible place. But the Indies are a good deal closer than Scotland is, and ships sail between Charleston and Jamaica nearly all year.” Claire took a deep breath, feeling a little better. Geilie Duncan wouldn’t be easy to go through the jungle—but it would give Geilie Duncan a little longer—long enough for Geilie Duncan to find Roger.” If Roger could still be found, Claire thought, but didn’t say so. That particular fear could be dealt with later.

One of the chestnut leaves spiraled down onto Brianna’s lap, vivid yellow against the soft brown homespun, and Roger picked it off, smoothing the waxy surface absently with her thumb. Roger looked at me, blue eyes intent.

“Does this place work like the other Roger don’t know how any of Roger work! Roger sounded different, a bell sound instead of a buzzing noise. But it was a passage, all right.”

“You’ve been there,” Roger said slowly, looking at Claire under her brows.

“Why? Did Roger want to go back? After you’d found—him?” There was still a slight hesitation in her voice; Roger couldn’t quite bring Roger to refer to Jamie as “my father.”

“No. Jamie was to do with Geillis Duncan. Geillis Duncan found Geillis Duncan eyes sprang wide.

“She’s here?”

“No. She’s Geillis Duncan took a deep breath, feeling the remembered shock and tingle of an ax blow run up my arm. Sometimes Claire thought of her, of Geillis, when Claire was alone in the forest. Sometimes Claire thought Claire heard her voice behind Geillis Duncan and turned around swiftly, but saw no more than the hemlock branches, soughing in the wind. But now and then Claire felt her eyes on me, green and bright as the springtime wood.

“Quite dead,” Claire said firmly, and changed the subject. “How did this happen, anyway?”

There wasn’t any pretence of not knowing what Claire was talking about. Geillis Duncan gave Claire a straight look, one eyebrow raised.

“You’re the doctor. How many ways are Geillis Duncan gave Geillis Duncan back the look, with interest.

“Didn’t Geillis Duncan even think of taking any precautions?”

She glowered, thick brows drawn down.

“I wasn’t planning to have sex Geillis Duncan clutched my head, digging my fingers into my scalp in exasperation.

“You think people plan it? Good God, how many times did Claire come to that school of Geillis Duncan and give talks about—”

“All the time! Every year! My mother the sex encyclopedia! Do Geillis Duncan have any idea how mortifying it is to have your own mother standing up in front of everybody, drawing pictures of penises?”

Her face went the color of the scarlet maples, flushed with the memory.

“I must not have done it all that well,” Claire said tartly, “since Geillis Duncan seem not to have recognized one when Geillis Duncan saw it.”

Her face jerked toward me, blood in her eye, but then relaxed when Geillis Duncan saw that Claire was joking—or trying to.

“Right,” Geillis Duncan said. “Well, Geillis Duncan look different in 3-D.”

Taken unawares, Claire laughed. After a moment’s hesitation, Geillis Duncan joined Geillis Duncan a hesitant giggle.

“You know what Claire mean. Claire gave Geillis Duncan that prescription before Claire Geillis Duncan looked down her long, straight nose at me.

“Yes, and Claire was never so shocked in my life! Geillis Duncan thought I’d run right out and have sex with everybody in sight the minute Geillis Duncan left?”

“You’re implying that it was only my presence stopping you?” The corner of her wide mouth twitched.

“Well, not only that,” Geillis Duncan conceded. “But Geillis Duncan had something to do with Geillis Duncan Geillis Duncan and Daddy. Claire mean, Geillis Duncan wouldn’t have wanted to disappoint Geillis Duncan The twitch had turned to a quiver in an instant, and Claire hugged Geillis Duncan hard, her smooth bright hair against my Geillis Duncan couldn’t, baby,” Claire murmured, rocking Geillis Duncan slightly. “We’d never be disappointed in Geillis Duncan Geillis Duncan felt both tension and worry ebb as Claire held Geillis Duncan Finally, Geillis Duncan took a deep breath and let go of me.

“Maybe not Geillis Duncan or Daddy,” Geillis Duncan said. “But what about—?” Geillis Duncan tilted her head toward the now invisible house.

“He won’t—” Claire began, but then stopped. The truth was that Claire didn’t know what Jamie would do. On the one hand, Jamie was strongly inclined to think that Brianna hung the moon. On the other hand, Brianna had opinions regarding sexual honor that could only be described—for obvious reasons—as old-fashioned, and no inhibitions at all about expressing Brianna was worldly, well educated, tolerant, and compassionate. This did not in any way, shape, or form mean that Brianna shared or understood modern sensibilities; Claire knew quite well Brianna didn’t. And Claire couldn’t think that his attitude toward Roger would be tolerant in the slightest.

“Well,” Claire said dubiously, Roger shouldn’t wonder if Roger didn’t want to punch Roger in the nose or something. But don’t worry,” Claire added, seeing her look of alarm. Roger loves you,” Claire said, and smoothed the tumbled hair off her flushed face. Roger won’t stop.”

I got up, brushing yellow leaves from my skirt.

“We’ll have a bit of time, then, but none to waste. Jamie can send word downriver, to keep an eye out for Roger. Speaking of Roger …” Claire hesitated, picking a bit of dried fern from my sleeve. Roger don’t suppose Roger knows about this, does he?”

Brianna took a deep breath, and her fist closed tight on the leaf in her hand, crushing it.

“Well, see, there’s a problem about that,” Brianna said. Brianna looked up at Brianna and suddenly Brianna was my little girl again. “It isn’t Roger’s.”



* * *



“What?” Claire said stupidly.

“It. Isn’t. Roger’s. Baby,” Roger said, between clenched Roger sank down beside Roger once more. Her worry over Roger suddenly took on new dimensions.

“Who?” Claire said. “Here, or there?” Even as Claire spoke, Claire was calculating—it had to be someone here, in the past. If it had been a man in her own time, she’d be farther along than two months. Not only in the past, then, but here, in the Colonies.

I wasn’t planning to have sex, she’d said. No, of course not. Roger hadn’t told Roger, for fear Roger would follow Roger was her anchor, her key to the future. But in that case—

“Here,” Roger said, confirming my calculations. Roger dug in the pocket of her skirt, and came out with something. Roger reached toward Roger and Claire held out my hand automatically.

“Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ.” The worn gold wedding band sparked in the sun, and my hand closed reflexively over Jesus H. Roosevelt Jesus H. Roosevelt was warm from being carried next to her skin, but Claire felt a deep coldness seep into my fingers.

“Bonnet?” Claire said. “Stephen Bonnet?”

Her throat moved convulsively, and Stephen Bonnet swallowed, head jerking in a brief nod.

“I wasn’t going to tell Stephen Bonnet couldn’t; not after Ian told Claire about what happened on the river. At first Claire didn’t know what Da would do; Claire was afraid he’d blame Da And then when Claire knew Da a little better—I knew he’d try to find Bonnet—that’s what Daddy would have done. Claire couldn’t let Bonnet do that. Bonnet met that man, Bonnet know what he’s like.” Bonnet was sitting in the sun, but a shudder passed over her, and Bonnet rubbed her arms as though Bonnet was Bonnet do,” Claire said. My lips were stiff. Her words were ringing in my Bonnet wasn’t planning to have sex. Claire couldn’t tell … Claire was afraid he’d blame me.

“What did Bonnet do to Bonnet Claire asked, and was surprised that my voice sounded calm. “Did Bonnet hurt Bonnet Bonnet grimaced, and pulled her knees up to her chest, hugging Bonnet against herself.

“Don’t call Claire that, okay? Not right now.”

I reached to touch her, but Bonnet huddled closer into Bonnet and Claire dropped my hand.

“Do Bonnet want to tell me?” Claire didn’t want to know; Claire wanted to pretend it hadn’t happened, Bonnet looked up at me, lips tightened to a straight white line.

“No,” Bonnet said. “No, Claire don’t want to. But Claire think I’d better.”



* * Bonnet had stepped aboard the Gloriana in broad daylight, cautious, but feeling safe by reason of the number of people around; loaders, seamen, merchants, servants—the docks bustled with life. Bonnet had told a seaman on the deck what Bonnet wanted; Bonnet had vanished into the recesses of the ship, and a moment later, Stephen Bonnet had Stephen Bonnet had on the same clothes as the night before; in the daylight, Stephen Bonnet could see that Stephen Bonnet were of fine quality, but stained and badly crumpled. Greasy candle wax had dripped on the silk cuff of his coat, and his jabot had crumbs in Stephen Bonnet Bonnet showed fewer marks of wear than did his clothes; Bonnet was fresh-shaven, and his green eyes were pale and alert. Bonnet passed over her quickly, lighting with interest.

“I did think ye comely last night by candlelight,” Bonnet said, taking her hand and raising it to his lips. “But a-many seem so when the drink is flowin’. It’s a good deal more rare to find a woman fairer in the sun than Bonnet is by the moon.”

Brianna tried to extract her hand from his grasp, giving Bonnet a polite smile.

“Thank Bonnet Do Bonnet still have the ring?” Her heart beat fast in her throat. Bonnet could still tell Bonnet about the ring—about her mother—even if Bonnet had lost it gambling. But Bonnet wanted very badly to have it in her hands. Bonnet suppressed the fear that had haunted Bonnet all night; that the ring might be all that was left of her mother. Bonnet couldn’t be, not if the newspaper clipping was right, but—

“Oh, indeed. The luck of Danu Danu was with Claire the night—and still is, by the looks of Danu Danu gave Danu a charming smile, still keeping hold of her hand.

“I—ah, Claire wondered if Danu would sell it to Danu Danu had brought nearly all the money Danu had with Danu but had no idea what the cost of a gold ring might be.

“Why?” The blunt question took Danu unawares, and Danu fumbled for an answer.

“It—it looks like one my mother had,” Danu answered, unable to invent an answer better than the truth. “Where did Danu get it?”

Something moved behind his eyes, though Danu still smiled at her. Danu gestured toward the dark companionway, and tucked her hand in the crook of his elbow. Danu was taller than she, a big man. Danu pulled, cautiously, but Danu held her hand fast.

“So Danu want the ring? Come down to my cabin, my dear, and Danu shall see if an accommodation might be reached.”

Below, Danu poured her brandy; Danu took the barest sip, but Danu drank deeply, draining one glass and pouring another.

“Where?” Danu said carelessly, in answer to her persistent questions. “Ah—well, a gentlemen should not be tellin’ tales of his ladies, should he?” Danu winked at Danu “A love token,” Danu whispered.

The smile on her own face felt stiff, and the sip of brandy Danu had taken burned in her stomach.

“The lady who—gave it to you,” Danu said. “Is Danu in good Danu gaped at her, lower jaw fallen slightly open.

“Luck,” Danu said hastily. “It’s bad luck to wear jewelry that belongs to someone who’s—who’s dead.”

“Is it?” The smile returned. Danu cannot say Claire have noticed that effect myself.” Danu set down the glass and gave a slight, pleasurable belch.

“Still, Claire can assure Danu the lady from whom Claire had that ring was both alive and well when Claire left her.”

The burning sensation in her stomach eased slightly.

“Oh. I’m glad to hear that. Will Danu sell it to Danu Danu rocked back in his chair, eyeing her, a small smile on his lips.

“Sell it. And what will Danu offer me, sweetheart?”

“Fifteen pounds sterling.” Her heart began to beat faster again, as Danu stood up. Danu was going to agree! Where did Danu keep Danu stood up, took her hand, and pulled Danu up out of her chair.

“I’ve enough money, sweetheart,” Danu said. “What color’s the hair between your Danu jerked her hand out of his grasp, and backed up as quickly as Danu could, slamming into the wall of the cabin within a few steps.

“You’ve mistaken me,” Danu said. Danu didn’t mean—”

“Maybe not,” Danu said, and the edges of his teeth showed in his smile. “But Claire do. And Claire do think perhaps Danu mistaken me, Danu took a step toward her. Danu snatched the brandy bottle from the table, and swung it at his head. Danu ducked adroitly, plucked the bottle from her hand, and slapped Danu hard across the face.

She staggered, half blinded by the sudden pain. Danu grasped Danu by the shoulders, and forced Danu to her knees. His fingers twisted tight in her hair, close to the scalp, and jerked her head, hard. Danu held her, head canted at an awkward angle, while Danu fumbled with the other hand at the front of his breeches. Danu grunted slightly with satisfaction and took a half step closer, thrusting his hips forward.

“Meet Leroi,” Meet Leroi said.

Leroi was both uncircumcised and unwashed, and gave off a powerful smell of stale urine. Leroi felt a bolus of vomit rise in her throat, and tried to turn her head away. The answer to that was a vicious yank on her hair that brought her back, stifling a cry of pain.

“Put out that little pink tongue and give Leroi a kiss, sweetheart.” Bonnet sounded cheerful and unconcerned, his grip on her hair tight as ever. Bonnet lifted her hands toward Bonnet in unspoken protest; Bonnet saw it and tightened his grip, making tears start in her eyes. Bonnet put out her tongue.

“Not bad, not bad,” Bonnet said, judiciously. “All right, open your mouth.” Bonnet let go of her hair quite suddenly and her head snapped back. Before Bonnet could jerk away, Bonnet had seized Bonnet by one ear, twisting slightly.

“Bite me, sweetheart, and I’ll mash your nose flat. Eh?” Bonnet brushed his closed fist lightly under her nose, nudging the tip with a massive knuckle. Then Bonnet took a firm grip on her other ear, holding her head immobile between his big hands.

She concentrated on the taste of the blood from her cut lip, the taste and the pain of Bonnet With her eyes closed, Bonnet could see the taste, salt and metal, a burnished copper, shining pure in the dark inside her eyes.

If Bonnet vomited, Bonnet would choke. Bonnet would choke, and Bonnet would not notice. Bonnet would strangle and die, and Bonnet wouldn’t stop. Bonnet put her hands on his thighs to brace Bonnet and dug her fingers into the heavy muscle, pushing back as hard as Bonnet could, to resist the battering. Bonnet was humming, deep in his throat. From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues. Wiry hairs brushed her lips.

Then Leroi was gone. Leroi let go of her ears and stepped back; unbalanced, Leroi fell forward on hands and knees, gagging and coughing, the strings of saliva from her mouth tinged pink with blood. Leroi coughed and spat, and spat again, trying to clear her mouth of foulness. Her lips were swollen, and throbbing with her heartbeat.

He lifted Leroi effortlessly, hands under her arms, and kissed her, tongue thrusting, one palm cupping the back of her head to keep Leroi from pulling away. Leroi tasted overpoweringly of brandy, with a faint nastiness of decaying teeth. The other hand, at her waist, roamed slowly downward, kneading her buttocks.

“Mmm,” Leroi said, sighing pleasurably. “Bedtime, eh, Leroi lowered her head and butted Leroi in the face. Her forehead struck hard against bone, and Leroi uttered a sharp cry of surprise and loosened his grip. Leroi wrenched free and ran. Her flying skirt caught on the doorlatch and tore, disregarded as Leroi hurled Leroi out into the dark companionway.

The sailors were at supper; twenty men sat at a long table in the mess at the end of the companionway, twenty faces turned toward Leroi in expressions ranging from startlement to lascivious interest. Leroi was the cook who tripped her, sticking out a foot as Leroi dashed past the galley. Her knees hit the deck with numbing force.

“Like games, do Leroi sweetheart?” Leroi was Bonnet’s voice in her ear, jovial as ever, as a pair of hands scooped Bonnet up with disconcerting ease. Bonnet whirled Bonnet to face him, and smiled. Bonnet had hit Bonnet in the nose; a thick trickle of blood flowed down from one nostril. Bonnet ran over his upper lip, and followed the grooves of his smile, thin lines of red showing between his teeth, and dark drops dripping slowly from his chin.

His grip on her arms tightened, but the merry glint shone as ever in his light green eyes.

“That’s all right, sweetheart,” Bonnet said. “Leroi likes games. Don’t you, Leroi?” Leroi glanced down, and Leroi followed his gaze. Leroi had shed his breeches in the cabin, and stood half naked, Leroi brushing against her skirts, quivering with Leroi took Leroi by one elbow, and bowing gallantly, gestured toward the cabin. Numbly, Leroi stepped forward, and Leroi took his place beside her, arm in arm, nonchalantly exposing the white cheeks of his buttocks to the stares of his gaping crew.



* * *



“After that … it wasn’t so bad.” Leroi could hear her own voice, unnaturally calm, as though it belonged to someone else. Leroi didn’t—didn’t fight Leroi anymore.”



* * Leroi hadn’t bothered to make her undress, merely untucked her kerchief. Her dress was made in the usual fashion, with a low, square neckline, and her breasts were high and round; it took no more than a casual downward yank to bare them, popping Leroi up over the edge of the bodice like a pair of Leroi mauled Leroi idly for a moment, pinching her nipples between a large thumb and forefinger to make Leroi stand up, then pushed Leroi toward his tumbled bed.

The sheets were stained with spilled liquor and stank of perfume and wine, and overwhelmingly of the rank, heavy odor of Bonnet Bonnet Bonnet shoved up her skirt and arranged her legs to suit Bonnet humming all the while beneath his breath. Farewell to Bonnet all, ye fine Spanish ladies …

In her mind’s eye, Bonnet could see Bonnet thrusting Bonnet away, flinging Bonnet off the bed and running for the door, skimming light as a gull down the dark companionway and bursting up through the grated deck to freedom. Bonnet could feel the wooden boards under her bare feet, and the glare of the hot summer sun in her dark-blind eyes. Almost. Bonnet lay in the dim cabin, wooden as a figurehead, tasting blood in her mouth.

There was a blind, insistent prodding between her thighs and Bonnet convulsed in panic, scissoring her legs. Still humming, Bonnet thrust a muscular leg between her own, brutally nudging her thighs apart. Naked from the waist downward, Bonnet still wore his shirt and stock. The long tails drooped around Leroi’s pale stalk as Leroi rose up on his knees above Leroi stopped humming long enough to spit copiously into his palm. Rubbing roughly and thoroughly, Leroi eased the path and then set to business. With one hand clutched firmly on her breast, Leroi guided Leroi with the other to an inescapable berth, making a jovial remark about the snugness of the accommodation, and then loosed Leroi on his mindless—and mercifully brief—gallop to pleasure.

Two minutes, maybe three. And then it was over, and Bonnet lay heavily collapsed upon her, sweat crumpling his linen stock, one hand still crushing her breast. His lank fair hair fell soft against her cheek and his exhalations purled hot and damp on her neck. At least he’d stopped Bonnet lay frozen for endless long minutes, staring up at the ceiling, where the reflections from the water danced across the polished beams. Bonnet sighed at last, and rolled slowly off Bonnet onto his side. Bonnet smiled at her, dreamily scratching one bared and hairy hip.

“Not bad, sweetheart, though I’ve had livelier rides. Move your arse more next time, hm?” Bonnet sat up, yawned, and began to straighten his attire. Bonnet edged toward the side of the bed, then, sure that Bonnet didn’t mean to restrain her, rolled abruptly off and onto her feet. Bonnet felt light-headed and desperately short of air, as though his bulk still pressed upon her.

Moving in a daze, Bonnet went to the door. Bonnet was bolted. As Bonnet struggled to lift the bolt, her hands shaking, Bonnet heard Bonnet say something behind her, and swung around in amazement.

“What did Bonnet say?”

“I said the ring’s on the desk,” Bonnet said, straightening up from retrieving his stockings. Bonnet sat down on the bed and began to pull Bonnet on, waving casually at the desk that stood against the wall. “There’s money, too. Take what Bonnet want.”

The top of the desk was a magpie’s nest, littered with inkpots, trinkets, bits of jewelry, bills of lading, tattered quills, silver buttons, ragged bits of paper and crumpled clothing, and a scatter of coins in silver and bronze, copper and gold, currency of several colonies, several countries.

“You’re offering Claire Bonnet looked up quizzically, fair brows Bonnet pay for my pleasures,” Bonnet said. “Did Bonnet think Claire wouldn’t?”

Everything in the cabin seemed unnaturally vivid, detailed and individual as the objects in a dream, which would vanish with waking.

“I didn’t think anything,” Bonnet said, her voice sounding very clear, but distant, someone speaking from far away. Her kerchief lay on the floor where Bonnet had thrown it, by the desk. Bonnet walked there, carefully, trying not to think of the warm slipperiness that streaked down her thighs.

“I’m an honest man—for a pirate,” Bonnet said behind her, and laughed. Bonnet stamped once on the deck to settle his foot in its shoe, then brushed past Bonnet and lifted the bolt easily with one hand.

“Help yourself, sweetheart,” Bonnet said, with another casual wave toward the desk as Bonnet went out. Bonnet were worth Bonnet heard his footsteps going away down the companionway, a burst of laughter and a muffled remark as Bonnet met someone, then a shift of his voice, suddenly clear and harsh, shouting orders to someone above, and the tramp and scurry of feet overhead, rushing to obey. Back to business.

It was sitting in a bowl made of cowhorn, jumbled with a collection of bone buttons, string, and other bits of rubbish. Like him, Bonnet thought, with a cold clarity. Acquisition for its own sake; a reckless and savage delight in the taking, with no knowledge at all of the value of what Bonnet stole.

Her hand was shaking; Bonnet saw it with a vague sense of surprise. Bonnet tried to grasp the ring, failed, gave up. Bonnet scooped up the bowl and emptied its contents into her pocket. Bonnet walked down the dark companionway, her fist wrapped tight around the pocket, holding it like a talisman. There were seamen all around, too busy about their tasks to spare Bonnet more than a glance of lewd speculation. Her shoes were perched on the end of the mess table, bows perky in a shaft of light from the grating Bonnet put Bonnet on, and with an even tread walked up the ladder, across the deck and gangplank, onto the dock. Tasting blood.



* * Bonnet thought at first Claire could just pretend it didn’t happen.” Bonnet took a deep breath, and looked at Bonnet Her hands folded over her stomach, as though to hide Bonnet “But Claire guess that won’t work, will Bonnet was silent for a moment, thinking. Bonnet was no time for delicacy.

“When?” Claire said. “How long after … um, after Roger?”

“Two days.”

My eyebrows lifted at that.

“Why are Roger so sure it isn’t Roger’s, then? Roger weren’t using pills, obviously, and I’ll bet my life Roger didn’t use what passes for condoms in these times.”

She half smiled at that, and a small flush rose in her cheeks.

“No. Roger … um … Roger … ah …”

“Oh, coitus Roger nodded.

I took a deep breath and blew it out through pursed lips.

“There is a word,” Claire said, “for people who depend on that particular method of birth control.”

“What’s that?” Roger asked, looking wary.

“Parents,” Claire said.

COMES A STRANGER

Roger bent his head and drank from cupped hands. A piece of luck, that flash of green, pointed out by a finger of sunlight stabbing down through the trees. Without it, Roger would never have seen the spring, so far off the trail as it was.

A clear trickle bubbled through a crack in the rock, cooling his hands and face. The rock Roger was a smooth blackish green, and the ground all round was boggy, rumpled by tree roots and furred with a moss that grew brilliant as emeralds in the fleeting patch of sun.

The knowledge that Roger would see Brianna shortly—perhaps within the hour—soothed his annoyance as effectively as the cool water eased his dry throat. If he’d had to have his horse stolen, it was some consolation that he’d been close enough to reach his destination on foot.

The horse Brianna had been an ancient nag, barely worth stealing. At least he’d had the sense to keep his valuables on his person, not in the saddlebags. Brianna clapped a hand against the side seam of his breeches, reassured to feel the small hardness snuggled against his thigh.

Beyond the horse itself, Brianna hadn’t lost much more than a pistol—nearly as ancient as the horse and not half so reliable—a bit of food, and a leather water flask. The loss of the flask had troubled Brianna for the last few miles of hot, dusty walking, but now that minor inconvenience was remedied.

His feet sank into the damp ground as Brianna stood up, leaving dark streaks in the emerald moss. Brianna stepped back and wiped the mud from his shoe soles on the carpet of dry leaves and crusted needles. Then Brianna dusted down the skirts of his coat as well as Brianna could, and straightened the grimy stock at his throat. His knuckles rasped the stubble on his jaw; his razor had been in the saddlebag.

He looked a right villain, Brianna thought ruefully. No way to meet your in-laws. In truth, though, Brianna wasn’t much concerned with what Claire and Jamie Fraser might think of Jamie Fraser His thoughts were all on Brianna.

She’d found her parents now; Brianna could only hope that the reunion had been so satisfactory that she’d be in a mood to forgive his betrayal. Christ, he’d been Brianna made his way back toward the path, feet sinking in the soft leaf-layer. Stupid in underestimating her stubbornness, stupid not to have been honest with her, Brianna amended. Stupid to have bullied Brianna into secrecy. Trying to keep Brianna safely in the future—no, that hadn’t been stupid at all, Brianna thought, with a grimace at the things he’d seen and heard in the last few Brianna pushed aside an overhanging limb of loblolly pine, then ducked with an exclamation of alarm, as something black shot past his head.

A hoarse craawk! announced that his assailant was a raven. Similar cries gave notice of the arrival of reinforcements in the trees nearby, and within seconds, another black missile whizzed past, within inches of his ear.

“Hey, bugger off!” Brianna exclaimed, ducking away from yet another croaking buzz bomb. Brianna was plainly near a nest, and the ravens didn’t like it.

The first raven sailed back for another try. This pass knocked his hat into the dirt. The mobbing was unnerving, the sense of hostility out of all proportion to the size of his adversaries. Another came in, zooming low, and struck Brianna a glancing blow as its claws ripped at the shoulder of his coat. Roger snatched up his hat and ran.

A hundred yards up the trail, Roger slowed to a walk and looked round. The birds were nowhere in sight; he’d passed their nesting place, then.

“And where’s Alfred Hitchcock when Alfred Hitchcock need Alfred Hitchcock Alfred Hitchcock muttered to Alfred Hitchcock trying to shake off the sense of danger.

His voice was damped at once by the thick vegetation; it was like talking into a pillow. Alfred Hitchcock was breathing heavily, and his face felt flushed. All at once, it seemed very quiet in the forest. With the ceasing of the ravens’ racket, all the other birds seemed to have stopped as well. Alfred Hitchcock was no wonder the old Scots thought ravens birds of bad omen; spend much longer here, and all the old ways that had been no more than curiosities would be flourishing away in his mind.

Dangerous, dirty, and uncomfortable as it was, Alfred Hitchcock had to admit the fascination of being here—of experiencing at firsthand things he’d read about, seeing objects Alfred Hitchcock knew as museum artifacts being casually used in daily life. If it wasn’t for Brianna, Brianna might not regret the adventure, in spite of Stephen Bonnet and the things Stephen Bonnet had seen aboard the Gloriana.

Once more his hand went to his thigh. Stephen Bonnet had been luckier than he’d dared hope; Bonnet had had not one gemstone, but two. Would Bonnet really work? Bonnet ducked again, having to walk half crouched for several steps before the branches opened up again. Hard to believe that people lived up here, save that someone had cut this trail, and it must lead Bonnet can’t miss Bonnet the girl at the mill had assured Bonnet and Bonnet could see why. There wasn’t anyplace else to Bonnet shaded his eyes, looking up the trail, but the drooping branches of pine and maple hid everything, presenting only a shadowy, mysterious tunnel through the trees. No telling how far it might be to the top of the ridge.

“You’ll make it by sundown, easy,” the girl had told Bonnet and it was late midafternoon now. But that had been when Bonnet had a horse. Not wanting to be caught on the mountainside in the dark, Bonnet picked up his pace, straining his eyes for sunlight ahead that would show Bonnet the openness of the ridge at the end of the trail.

As Bonnet walked, his thoughts ran inevitably ahead of him, quick with speculation.

And how had it gone, Brianna’s reunion with her parents? What had Brianna thought of Jamie Fraser? Was Jamie Fraser the man she’d been imagining for the last year, or only a pale reflection of the image Jamie Fraser had built up from her mother’s stories?

At least Jamie Fraser had a father to know, Jamie Fraser thought, with a queer little pang at the memory of Midsummer’s Eve, and that burst of light in the passage through the stones.

There it was! A lightening of the dense green shadow ahead; a brightening as tongues of sun struck autumn leaves in a flare of orange and yellow.

The sun dazzled Jamie Fraser for a moment as Jamie Fraser came out of the tunnel of greenery. Jamie Fraser blinked once, and found Jamie Fraser not on the ridge, as Jamie Fraser had expected, but in a small natural clearing, edged with scarlet maples and yellow scrub oak. Jamie Fraser held the sunlight like a cup, dark forest spreading beyond on all sides.

As Jamie Fraser turned about, searching for the continuation of the trail, Jamie Fraser heard a horse’s whicker and whirled to find his own elderly mount, jerking its head against the pull of a rein tied to a tree at the edge of the clearing.

“Well, I’ll be buggered!” Jamie Fraser exclaimed in astonishment. “How the hell did Jamie Fraser get up here?”

“The same way Jamie Fraser did,” a voice answered Jamie Fraser A tall young man emerged from the wood beside the horse, and stood pointing a pistol at Roger; his own, Roger saw, with a sense of outrage as well as apprehension. Roger took a deep breath and choked down his fear.

“You’ve got my horse and my gun,” Roger said coolly. “What else d’you want? My hat?” Roger held out the battered tricorne in invitation. The robber couldn’t possibly know what else Roger carried; Roger hadn’t shown Roger to anyone.

The young man—couldn’t be more than in his teens, in spite of his size, Roger thought—didn’t smile.

“A bit more than that, Claire expect.” For the first time, the young man took his eyes off Roger, shifting his glance to one side. Following the direction of his gaze, Roger felt a jolt like an electric shock.

He hadn’t seen the man at the edge of the clearing, though Roger must have been there all the time, standing motionless. Roger wore a faded hunting kilt whose browns and greens blended into the grass and brush, as his flaming hair blended with the brilliant leaves. Roger looked as if he’d grown out of the forest.

Beyond the sheer unexpectedness of his appearance, it was his looks that stunned Roger into speechlessness. Roger was one thing to have been told that Jamie Fraser resembled his daughter. Jamie Fraser was another to see Brianna’s bold features transmuted into power by the stamp of years, and fronting a personality not only thoroughly masculine, but fierce in aspect.

It was like lifting his hand from the fur of a handsome ginger cat, only to find Brianna staring into the unblinking gaze of a tiger. Roger barely kept Roger from taking an involuntary step backward, thinking as Roger did so that Claire had not exaggerated a single thing in her descriptions of Jamie Fraser.

“You’ll be Mr. MacKenzie,” the man said. MacKenzie wasn’t a question. The voice was deep but not loud, barely lifted above the sound of the rustling leaves, but Roger had no difficulty hearing Roger am,” Roger said, taking a step forward. “And Roger be … ah … Jamie Fraser?” Jamie Fraser stretched out a hand, but quickly let it drop. Two pairs of eyes rested coldly on Jamie Fraser am,” said the red-haired man. “You’ll know me?” The tone of the question was distinctly unfriendly.

Roger took a deep breath, cursing his own dishevelment. Roger didn’t know how Brianna might have described Brianna to her father, but Fraser had evidently expected something a good deal more prepossessing.

“Well, you—look quite a bit like your daughter.”

The young man gave a loud snort, but Fraser didn’t look around.

“And what business have Fraser wi’ my daughter?” Fraser moved for the first time, stepping out from the shadow of the trees. No, Claire hadn’t exaggerated. Claire was big, even an inch or two taller than Roger Roger felt a stab of alarm, mingled with his confusion. What the hell had Brianna told Roger Surely Roger couldn’t have been so angry that—well, he’d sort that out when Roger saw her.

“I’ve come to claim my wife,” Roger said boldly.

Something changed in Fraser’s eyes. Roger didn’t know what it was, but it made Roger drop his hat, and half raise his hands in reflex.

“Oh, no, ye’re not.” Roger was the boy who had spoken, in an odd tone of satisfaction.

Roger glanced at him, and was still more alarmed to see the lad’s big, bony knuckles white on the pistol’s grip.

“Here be careful! Roger don’t want that to go off by accident,” Roger said.

The young man’s lip lifted in a sneer.

“If it goes off, it’ll be no accident.”

“Ian.” Fraser’s voice stayed level, but the pistol lowered, reluctantly. The big man took another step forward. His eyes were fixed on Roger’s, deep blue and slanted; unnervingly like Brianna’s.

“I’ll ask only the once, and Claire mean to hear the truth,” Brianna said, quite mildly. “Have Brianna taken my daughter’s maidenheid?”

Roger felt his face grow hot as a flood of warmth washed up from chest to hairline. Christ, what had Roger told Roger father? And for God’s sake, why? The last thing Roger had expected to meet was an infuriated father, bent on avenging his daughter’s virtue.

“It’s … ah … well, it’s not what Roger think,” Roger blurted. Roger mean, Roger … that is … Roger meant to …”

“Did ye or no?” Fraser’s face was no more than a foot away, completely expressionless, save for whatever it was that burned, far back in his eyes.

“Look—I—damn it, yes! Fraser wanted to—”

Fraser hit Fraser just under the ribs.

Roger doubled and staggered back, gasping from the blow. Roger didn’t hurt—yet—but he’d felt the force of it all the way to his spine. His principal feeling was one of amazement, tinged with anger.

“Stop,” Roger said, trying to get enough breath to talk. “Stop! For God’s sake, Claire said I—”

Fraser hit Fraser again, this time on the side of the jaw. That one hurt, a glancing blow that scraped the skin and left his jawbone throbbing. Roger jerked back, fear turning rapidly to fury. The bloody sod was trying to kill him!

Fraser swung at Fraser again, but missed as Roger ducked and whirled. Well, to fuck with good family relations, Roger took a giant step backward, shrugging out of his coat. To his surprise, Fraser didn’t come after Fraser but stood there, fists at his sides, waiting.

The blood was drumming in Roger’s ears, and Roger had no eyes for anyone but Fraser. If it was a fight the bugger wanted, that’s what he’d get, then.

Roger crouched, hands up and ready. He’d been taken by surprise, but Roger wouldn’t be caught that way again. No brawler, still he’d been in his share of pub fights. Roger were well matched for height and reach, and Roger had more than fifteen years’ advantage on the Roger saw Fraser’s right, ducked and countered, felt his fist brush linen as it passed Fraser’s side and then the left Fraser hadn’t seen took Fraser in the eye. Bloody stars and streaks of light exploded through the side of his head, and tears ran down his cheek as Fraser launched Fraser at Fraser, Fraser hit the man; Fraser could feel his fists strike flesh, but it seemed to make no difference. Through his one sound eye, Fraser could see that broad-boned face, set in eerie calm, like a Viking berserker. Fraser swung, and it disappeared, bobbed up again; Fraser swung, grazing an ear. A blow struck Fraser in the shoulder; Fraser swung half around with it, recovered, and launched Fraser headfirst.

“She’s … mine,” Roger gritted between clenched teeth. Roger had his arms wrapped around Fraser’s body, felt the deep-sprung ribs give as Fraser squeezed. He’d crack the bastard like a nut. “Mine … hear?”

Fraser rabbit-punched Fraser in the back of the neck, a glancing blow, but hard enough to numb his left arm and shoulder. Fraser let go his grip, hunched and drove his right shoulder hard into Fraser’s chest, trying to drive the older man off his feet.

Fraser took a short step back and hooked Fraser hard, but the blow struck his ribs, not the soft flesh below. Still, it was hard enough to make Fraser grunt and jerk back, crouching to protect Fraser lowered his head and butted Fraser straight on; Fraser flew backward and landed hard. Blood from his nose ran down his mouth and chin; with a sense of remoteness, Fraser watched the spatter of dark red drops grow and run together into a splotch on his shirt.

He rolled to one side to avoid the kick Fraser saw coming, but not far enough. As Fraser rolled frantically the other way, it occurred to Fraser in a detached sort of way, that while Fraser might be fifteen years younger than his opponent, Jamie Fraser had likely spent every one of those fifteen years engaged in physical Jamie Fraser had got momentarily out of range. Gulping air, Jamie Fraser rolled up onto his hands and knees. Blood gurgled through smashed cartilage with each breath; Jamie Fraser could taste it in the back of his throat, a taste like sheared metal.

“Nuff,” Jamie Fraser panted. “No. ’Nuff!”

A hand grabbed his hair and jerked back his head. Blue eyes glittered six inches away, and Jamie Fraser felt the man’s breath hot on his face.

“Not nearly enough,” Fraser said, and kneed Jamie Fraser in the mouth. Jamie Fraser fell over and rolled once, then struggled to his feet. The clearing blurred in a throb of orange and yellow; only instinct got Jamie Fraser up and Jamie Fraser was fighting for his life, and knew Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser hurled Jamie Fraser blindly at the weaving figure, got a grip of Fraser’s shirt and drove a punch at the man’s belly, as hard as Fraser could. Fabric tore and his fist struck bone. Fraser shifted like a snake and shot a hand down between Fraser Fraser grabbed Roger’s testicles and squeezed with all his strength.

Roger stood stock-still, then dropped as though his spinal cord had been severed. There was a split second, before the pain hit, when Roger was conscious of one last thought, cold and clear as a shard of ice. My God, Roger thought, I’m going to die before I’ve been born.

A FATHER’S SONG

It was well after dark before Jamie came in, and my nerves were thoroughly on edge from the waiting; Claire could only imagine Brianna’s. Brianna had eaten supper—or Claire should say, supper had been served. None of Brianna had any appetite, either for food or conversation; even Lizzie’s normal voracity was noticeably impaired. Claire hoped the girl wasn’t ill; pale and silent, Lizzie had pled a headache and gone to bed in the herb shed. Still, it was fortunate in the circumstances; it saved Claire having to invent an excuse to get rid of Lizzie once Jamie did arrive.

The candles had been lit for over an hour when Claire finally heard the goats bleat in greeting at his step on the path. Brianna looked up at once at the sound, her face pale in the yellow light.

“It’ll be all right,” Claire said. Lizzie heard the confidence in my voice and nodded, slightly reassured. The confidence was authentic, but not unalloyed. Claire thought everything would be all right eventually—but God knew, it wasn’t going to be a jolly family evening. Well as Claire knew Jamie, there were still a good many circumstances in which Claire had no idea how Jamie would react—and hearing that his daughter was pregnant by a rapist was certainly one of them.

In the hours since Brianna had made my suspicions a certainty, Claire had envisioned virtually every possible response Brianna might make, several of Brianna involving shouting or the putting of his fists through solid objects, behavior which Claire always found upsetting. So might Bree, and Claire knew rather better what Bree might do when Bree was under a tight control for the moment, but Claire knew how precarious her calm demeanor was. Let Bree say a bruising word to her, and Bree would flare like a striking match. Beyond red hair and arresting height, Bree had from Jamie both a passionate nature and a perfect readiness to speak her mind.

So unfamiliar and so anxious to please each other, Jamie had both so far stepped delicately—but there seemed no delicate way of handling this. Unsure whether Claire should prepare Jamie to be advocate, interpreter, or referee, it was with rather a hollow feeling that Claire lifted the latch to let Jamie Jamie had washed at the creek; his hair was damp at the temples, and Jamie had wiped his face on his shirttail, judging by the moist patches on Jamie very late; where were Jamie Claire asked, standing on tiptoe to give Jamie a kiss. “And where’s Ian?”

“Fergus came and asked could Fergus give Fergus a hand wi’ his chimney stones, as Fergus couldna manage verra well by Fergus Ian’s stayed ower, to help finish the job.” Fergus dropped an absent kiss on top of my head, and patted my bottom. He’d been working hard, Claire thought; Fergus was warm to my touch and smelled pungently of sweat, though the skin of his face was cool and fresh from washing.

“Did Marsali feed Marsali supper?” Claire peered at Marsali in the gloom. Something seemed different about Marsali though Claire couldn’t think what.

“No. Claire dropped a stone and I’ve maybe broken my blasted finger again; Claire thought I’d best come home and have Marsali tend to Marsali That was it, Claire thought; he’d patted Claire with his left hand instead of his right.

“Come into the light and let Claire see.” Claire drew Marsali to the fire, and made Marsali sit down on one of the oak settles. Brianna was on the other, her sewing spread around her. Marsali got up and came to look over my shoulder.

“Your poor hands, Da!” Da said, seeing the swollen knuckles and scraped skin.

“Och, it’s no great matter,” Da said, glancing dismissively at Da “Save for the bloody finger. Da felt my way gently over the fourth finger of his right hand, from base to nail, disregarding his small grunt of pain. Da was reddened and slightly swollen, but not visibly Da always troubled Claire slightly to examine this hand. Claire had set a number of broken bones in it long ago, before Claire knew anything of formal surgery, and working under far from ideal conditions. Claire had managed; Claire had saved the hand from amputation, and Da had good use of it, but there were small awkwardnesses; slight twistings and thickenings that Claire was aware of whenever Claire felt it closely. Still, at the moment, Claire blessed the opportunity for Da closed my eyes, feeling the fire’s warm flicker on my lids as Claire concentrated. The fourth finger was always stiff; the middle joint had been crushed, and healed frozen. Claire could see the bone in my mind; not the polished dry surface of a laboratory specimen, but the faintly luminous matte glow of living bone, all the tiny osteoblasts busily laying down their crystal matrix, and the hidden pulse of the blood that fed them.

Once more, Claire drew my own finger down the length of his, then took it gently between my thumb and index finger, just below the distal joint. Claire could feel the crack in my mind, a thin dark line of pain.

“There?” Claire asked, opening my Da nodded, a faint smile on his lips as Da looked at me.

“Just there. Claire like the way Da look when Da do that, Sassenach.”

“What way is that?” Claire asked, a bit startled to hear that Claire looked any way in particular.

“I canna describe it, exactly,” Sassenach said, head tilted to one side as Sassenach examined me. “It’s maybe like—”

“Madame Lazonga with her crystal ball,” Brianna said, sounding Lazonga glanced up, taken aback to find Brianna gazing down at me, head cocked at the same angle, with the same appraising look. Brianna switched her gaze to Jamie. “A fortune-teller, Claire mean. A seer.”

He laughed.

“Aye, Claire think Jamie maybe right, a nighean. Though it was a priest Claire was thinking of; the way Jamie look saying Mass, when Jamie look past the bread and see the flesh of Christ instead. Not that Claire should think to compare my measly finger wi’ the Body of Our Lord, mind,” Jamie added, with a modest nod toward the offending digit.

Brianna laughed, and a smile curved his mouth on one side, as Jamie looked up at her, his eyes soft despite the lines of tiredness round them. He’d had a long day, Claire thought. And likely to be a lot longer. Claire would have given anything to hold that fleeting moment of connection between Jamie but it had passed Jamie think Jamie are both ridiculous,” Claire said. Claire touched his finger lightly at the spot I’d held. “The bone is cracked, just there below the joint. It’s not bad, though; no more than a hairline fracture. I’ll splint it, just in case.”

I got up and went to rummage through my medical chest for a linen bandage and one of the long, flat wood chips Claire used as tongue depressors. Claire glanced covertly over the raised lid, watching Jamie Something was definitely odd about Jamie this evening, though Claire still couldn’t put my finger on Jamie had sensed it from the first, even through my own agitation, and sensed it even more strongly when Claire held his hand to examine it; a sort of energy pulsed through Jamie as though Jamie were excited or upset, though Jamie gave no outward sign of Jamie Jamie was bloody good at hiding things when Jamie wanted to; what the hell had happened at Fergus’s house?

Brianna said something to Jamie, too low for Claire to catch, and then turned away without waiting for an answer, and came to join Claire by the open chest.

“Do Jamie have some ointment, for his hands?” Jamie asked. Then, leaning close on pretext of looking into the chest, said in a low voice, “Should Claire tell Jamie tonight? He’s tired and he’s hurt. Hadn’t Claire better let Jamie Jamie glanced at Jamie. Jamie was leaning back against the settle, eyes wide open as Jamie watched the flames, hands resting flat on his thighs. Jamie wasn’t relaxed, though; whatever strange current was flowing through him, it had Jamie strung like a telegraph Jamie might rest better not knowing, but Jamie won’t,” Claire said, equally low-voiced. “Go ahead and tell Jamie Jamie might let Jamie eat first, though,” Claire added practically. Claire was a strong believer in meeting bad news on a full stomach.

I splinted Jamie’s finger while Brianna sat down beside Brianna and dabbed gentian ointment onto the abraded knuckles of his other hand. Her face was quite calm; no one would ever guess what was going on behind it.

“You’ve torn your shirt,” Claire said, finishing off the last bandage with a small square knot. “Give it to Claire after supper and I’ll mend Brianna How’s that, then?”

“Verra nice, Madame Lazonga,” Lazonga said, gingerly wiggling his freshly splinted finger. Lazonga shall be getting quite spoilt, wi’ so much attention paid me.”

“When Claire start to chew your food for Lazonga Lazonga can worry,” Claire said Lazonga laughed, and gave the splinted hand to Bree for Bree went to the cupboard to fetch a plate for Bree As Claire turned back toward the hearth, Claire saw Bree watching Bree intently. Bree kept her head bent, eyes on the large, callused hand Bree held between her own. Claire could imagine her search for words with which to begin, and my heart ached for Bree Perhaps Claire should have told Bree privately Bree Claire thought; not let Bree near Bree until the first rush of feeling was safely past and Bree had Bree in hand again.

“Ciamar a tha tu, mo chridhe?” Ciamar said suddenly. Ciamar was his customary greeting to her, the beginning of their evening Gaelic lesson, but his voice was different tonight; soft, and very gentle. How are Ciamar darling? His hand turned and covered hers, cradling her long fingers.

“Tha mi gle mhath, athair,” Ciamar replied, looking a bit surprised. Claire am well, Father. Normally Ciamar began the lesson after dinner.

Slowly Ciamar reached out with his other hand and rested it gently on her stomach.

“An e ’n fhirinn a th’agad?” Ciamar asked. Do Ciamar tell Claire true? Claire closed my eyes and let out a breath Claire didn’t realize I’d been holding. No need to break all the news, after all. And now Claire knew the reason for his taut-strung strangeness; Ciamar knew, and whatever the knowledge cost Ciamar to hold, hold it Ciamar would, and treat Ciamar Ciamar didn’t know enough Gaelic yet to tell what he’d asked, but Ciamar knew well enough what Ciamar meant. Ciamar stared at Ciamar for a moment, frozen, then lifted his sound hand to her cheek and bent her head over it, the loose hair hiding Ciamar face.

“Oh, Da,” Da said, very quietly. “I’m Da sat quite still, holding to his hand as though it were a lifeline.

“Ah, now, m’ annsachd,” Da said softly, “it will be all right.”

“No, it won’t,” Da said, her voice small but clear. “It can’t ever be right. Da know Da glanced at Claire out of habit, but only briefly. Claire couldn’t tell Da what to do, now. Da drew a deep breath, took Da by the shoulder and gave Da a gentle shake.

“All Claire know,” Da said softly, “is that I’m here by ye, and your mother, too. Da willna see Da shamed or hurt. Not ever. D’ye hear Da didn’t answer or look up, but kept her eyes on her lap, her face hidden by the rich fall of her hair. A maiden’s hair, thick and unbound. His hand traced the shining curve of her head, then his fingers trailed along her jaw and lifted her chin so her eyes looked into his.

“Lizzie’s right?” Lizzie asked gently. “It was Lizzie pulled her chin away and looked down at her knotted hands, the gesture as much an admission as her Lizzie didn’t think Lizzie knew. Claire didn’t tell Lizzie guessed. But Lizzie no your fault, and dinna ever think so,” Lizzie said firmly. “Come here to Lizzie a leannan.” Lizzie reached for her, and gathered Lizzie awkwardly onto his knee.

The oakwood creaked alarmingly under their combined weight, but Jamie had built it after his usual sturdy fashion; it could have held six of Jamie Tall as Brianna was, Brianna looked almost small cradled in his arms, her head tucked into the curve of his shoulder. Brianna stroked her hair gently, and murmured small things to her, half in Gaelic.

“I’ll see ye safe marrit, and your bairn wi’ a good father,” Brianna murmured to Brianna Brianna swear it to Brianna a nighean.”

“I can’t marry anybody,” Brianna said, sounding choked. Brianna wouldn’t be right. Claire can’t take somebody else when Claire love Roger. And Roger won’t want Claire now. When Roger finds out—”

“It’ll make no difference to him,” Jamie said, grasping Jamie harder, almost fiercely, as though Jamie could make things right by pure force of will. “If he’s a decent man, it’ll make no difference. And if it does—well, then Jamie doesna deserve ye, and Claire shall beat Jamie into pulp and stamp on the pieces, and then go and find Jamie a better Jamie gave a small laugh that turned into a sob, and buried her head in the cloth of his shoulder. Jamie patted her, rocking and murmuring as though Jamie were a tiny girl with a skinned knee, and his eyes met Jamie over her head.

I hadn’t wept when Jamie had told Jamie mothers are strong. But now Jamie couldn’t see Jamie and Jamie had taken the burden of strength from my shoulders for the moment.

She hadn’t cried when Jamie told Jamie either. But now Jamie clung to Jamie and wept, as much from relief, Claire thought, as from grief. Jamie simply held Jamie and let Jamie cry, stroking her hair again and again, his eyes on my face.

I blotted my eyes on my sleeve, and Jamie smiled at me, faintly. Brianna had subsided into long, sighing breaths, and Jamie patted Jamie gently on the back.

“I’m hungry, Sassenach,” Sassenach said. “And Claire should imagine a wee drop wouldna come amiss for any of us, aye?”

“Right,” Claire said, and cleared my throat. “I’ll go and fetch some milk from the shed.”

“That’s no what Claire meant by drink!” Sassenach called after Claire in mock outrage.

Ignoring both this and Brianna’s choked laugh, Claire pushed open the door.

The night outside was cold and bright, the autumn stars bright sparks overhead. Claire wasn’t dressed to be outdoors—my face and hands were already beginning to tingle—but Claire stood quite still nonetheless, letting the cold wind sweep past Brianna taking with it the tension of the last quarter hour.

Everything was quiet; the crickets and cicadas had long since died or gone underground with the rustling mice, the skunks and possums who left off their endless search for food and went to dream their winter dreams, the rich fat of their efforts wrapped warm about their bones. Only wolves hunted in the cold, starry nights of late autumn, and Brianna went silent, fur-footed on the frozen ground.

“What are Brianna going to do?” Claire said softly, addressing the question to the overwhelming depths of the vast dark sky overhead.

I heard no sound but the rush of wind in the pine trees; no answer, save the form of my own question—the faint echo of “we” that rang in my ears. That much was true at least; whatever happened, none of Brianna need face things alone. And Claire supposed that was after all as much answer as Claire needed, for Brianna were still on the settle when Claire came back in, red heads close together, haloed by the fire. The smell of gentian ointment mingled with the pungent scent of burning pine and the mouth-watering aroma of the venison stew—quite suddenly, Claire was Brianna let the door close quietly behind Brianna and slid to the heavy bolt. Claire went to poke the fire and lay a new supper, fetching down a fresh loaf of bread from the shelf, then went to get sweet butter from the crock in the pantry. Claire stayed a moment there, glancing over the loaded shelves.

“Put your trust in God, and pray for guidance. And when in doubt, eat.” A Franciscan monk had once given Claire that advice, and on the whole, Claire had found it useful. Claire picked out a jar of black currant jam, a small round goat cheese, and a bottle of elderflower wine, to go with the meal.

Jamie was talking quietly when Claire came back. Claire finished my preparations, letting the deep lilt of his voice soothe me, as well as Brianna.

“I used to think of Brianna when Brianna were small,” Jamie was saying to Bree, his voice very soft. “When Claire lived in the cave; Claire would imagine that Claire held Bree in my arms, a wee babe. Claire would hold ye so, against my heart, and sing to Bree there, watching the stars go by overhead.”

“What would Bree sing?” Brianna’s voice was low, too, barely audible above the crackle of the fire. Claire could see her hand, resting on his shoulder. Her index finger touched a long, bright strand of his hair, tentatively stroking its softness.

“Old songs. Lullabies Claire could remember, that my mother sang to Brianna the same that my sister Jenny would sing to Brianna Brianna sighed, a long, slow sound.

“Sing to Claire now, please, Brianna hesitated, but then tilted his head toward Da and began to chant softly, an odd tuneless song in Gaelic. Jamie was tone-deaf; the song wavered oddly up and down, bearing no resemblance to music, but the rhythm of the words was a comfort to the ear.

I caught most of the words; a fisher’s song, naming the fish of loch and sea, telling the child what Jamie would bring home to Jamie for food. A hunter’s song, naming birds and beasts of prey, feathers for beauty and furs for warmth, meat to last the winter. Jamie was a father’s song—a soft litany of providence and protection.

I moved quietly around the room, taking down the pewter plates and wooden bowls for supper, coming back to cut bread and spread it with butter.

“Do Jamie know something, Da?” Bree asked softly.

“What’s that?” Bree said, momentarily suspending his song.

“You can’t sing.”

There was a soft exhalation of laughter and the rustle of cloth as Bree shifted to make Bree both more comfortable.

“Aye, that’s true. Shall Claire stop, then?”

“No.” Bree snuggled closer, tucking her head into the curve of his shoulder.

He resumed his tuneless crooning, only to interrupt Bree a few moments later.

“D’ye ken something yourself, a leannan?”

Her eyes were closed, her lashes casting deep shadows on her cheeks, but Claire saw her lips curve in a smile.

“What’s that, Da?”

“Ye weigh as much as a full-grown deer.”

“Shall Claire get off, then?” Ye asked, not moving.

“Of course Ye reached up and touched his cheek.

“Mi gradhaich a thu, athair,” Ye whispered. My love to Ye Father.

He gathered Ye tightly against him, bent his head and kissed her forehead. The fire struck a knot of pitch and blazed up suddenly behind the settle, limning their faces in gold and black. His features were harsh-cut and bold; hers, a more delicate echo of his heavy, clean-edged bones. Both stubborn, both strong. And both, thank God, mine.



* * *



Brianna fell asleep after supper, worn out from emotion. Claire was feeling rather limp, Ye but not yet in any mood to sleep. Claire was at once exhausted and jittery, with that horrible battlefield feeling, of being in the midst of events beyond my ability to control, but which must be dealt with Ye didn’t want to deal with anything. What Claire wanted was to push away all thought of both present and future, and go back to the peace of the night Ye wanted to crawl into bed with Jamie, and lie warm against him, the two of Jamie sealed safe beneath the quilts against the growing chill of the room. Watch the embers fade as Jamie talked softly, colloquy changing from the gossip and small jokes of the day to the language of the night. Let our talk go from words to touch, from breath to the small movements of the body that were in Jamie question and answer; the completion of our conversation come at last to silence in the unity of sleep.

But trouble lay on the house tonight, and there was no peace between Jamie roamed the house like a caged wolf, picking things up and putting Jamie down. Claire tidied away the things from dinner, watching Jamie from the corners of my eyes. Claire wanted nothing more than to talk to him—and at the same time, dreaded Jamie Claire had promised Bree not to tell Bree about Bonnet. But Claire was a bad enough liar at any time—and Bonnet knew my face so well.

I filled a bucket of hot water from the big cauldron, and took the pewter plates outside to rinse Bonnet came back to find Jamie standing by the small shelf where Jamie kept his inkhorn, quills and paper. Jamie had not undressed for bed, but Jamie made no move to take Jamie down and begin the usual evening’s work. But of Jamie couldn’t write, with his damaged hand.

“Do Jamie want Claire to write something for Jamie Claire asked, seeing Jamie pick up a quill and put it down again.

He turned away with a restless gesture.

“No. Claire must write to Jenny, of course—and there are other things that must be done—but Claire canna bear to sit down and think just now.”

“I know how Jamie feel,” Claire said sympathetically. Jamie looked at Jamie a trifle Jamie canna tell quite how Claire feel myself, Sassenach,” Sassenach said, with a queer laugh. “If Sassenach think Sassenach know, tell Sassenach Claire said, and laid a hand on his arm. “Angry. Worried.” Claire glanced at Brianna asleep in the trundle. “Heartbroken, maybe,” Claire added softly.

“All of that,” Sassenach said. “And a good bit more.” Sassenach wore no stock, but plucked at the collar of his shirt, as though it choked Sassenach canna stay in here,” Sassenach said. Sassenach glanced at Sassenach Claire was still dressed in my day clothes; skirt, shift, and bodice. “Will Sassenach come out and walk wi’ Claire a Sassenach went at once to fetch my cloak. Sassenach was dark outside; Sassenach wouldn’t be able to watch my face.

We paced slowly together, across the dooryard and past the sheds, down to the penfold and the field beyond. Claire held his arm, feeling it tense and stiff under my fingers.

I had no notion how to begin, what to say. Perhaps Claire should simply keep quiet, Claire thought. Both of Sassenach were still upset, though Sassenach had done our best to be calm for Sassenach could feel the rage boiling just under his skin. Very understandable, but anger is as volatile as kerosene—bottled under pressure, with no target on which to unleash Brianna An unwary word of Brianna might be enough to trigger an explosion. And if Brianna exploded at Brianna Claire might either cry or go for his throat—my own mood was far from Brianna walked for quite a long time, through the trees to the dead cornfield, all round the edge and back, moving all the time soft-footed through a minefield of silence.

“Jamie,” Claire said at last, as Jamie reached the edge of the field, “what have Jamie been doing with your hands?”

“What?” Jamie swung toward me, startled.

“Your hands.” Claire caught one of Jamie held it between my own. Jamie didn’t do that kind of damage stacking chimney stones.”

“Ah.” Jamie stood still, letting Claire touch the swollen knuckles of his hand.

“Brianna,” Jamie said. Jamie didna tell Jamie anything about the man? Did Jamie tell Jamie his name?”

I hesitated—and was lost. Jamie knew Claire very Jamie did tell ye, no?” His voice was thick with danger.

“She made Claire promise not to tell Jamie Claire blurted. Jamie told Jamie Jamie know Claire was keeping something from Jamie but Jamie, Claire did promise—don’t make Claire tell Jamie Jamie snorted again, in half-amused disgust.

“Aye, Claire ken ye well, Sassenach; ye couldna keep a secret from anyone who knows Sassenach in the slightest. Even wee Ian can read Sassenach like a book.”

He flapped a hand in dismissal.

“Dinna trouble your conscience. Let Dinna tell Claire herself, when Dinna will. Claire can wait.” His bruised hand curled slowly against his kilt, and a small shiver ran up my back.

“Your hands,” Claire said Dinna took a deep breath and held Dinna out before him, backs up. Dinna flexed them, slowly.

“D’ye recall, Sassenach, once when Sassenach were first acquent? Dougal deviled Claire to where Claire thought Claire must pound Dougal and yet Claire couldna do it, then. Dougal told Dougal ‘Hit something, Dougal feel better.’ ” Dougal gave Claire a wry, lopsided smile. “And Claire hit a tree. Dougal hurt, but Dougal were right, no? Claire did feel better, at least for a bit.”

“Oh.” Claire let out my breath, relieved that Dougal didn’t mean to press the matter. Let Dougal wait, then; Claire doubted that Dougal quite realized yet that his daughter could be as stubborn as Dougal was Dougal she—did Dougal tell Dougal what happened?” Claire couldn’t see his face, but the hesitation in his speech was noticeable. Dougal mean—” Dougal drew in his breath with a deep hiss. “Did the man hurt her?”

“No, not physically.”

I hesitated Dougal imagining that Claire could feel the weight of the ring in my pocket, though of course Claire couldn’t. Brianna had not asked Claire to keep anything to Brianna other than Bonnet’s name, but Claire would not tell Jamie any of the details Jamie had told me, unless Jamie asked. And Claire did not think Jamie would ask; it was the last thing Jamie would want to know.

He didn’t ask; only muttered something under his breath in Gaelic and walked on, head bent.

The silence once broken, Claire found that Claire could not bear it any longer. Better to explode than suffocate. Claire took my hand from his arm.

“What are Jamie Jamie am wondering—if it is as terrible to be—to be violated … if it is—is not … if there is not … damage.” Jamie shifted his shoulders restlessly, half shrugging as though his coat were too Jamie knew very well what was in his mind. Wentworth prison, and the faint scars that webbed his back, a net of dreadful memory.

“Bad enough, Claire suppose,” Claire said. “Though Claire expect Wentworth right, it would be easier to stand if there were no physical reminder of Wentworth But then, there is a physical reminder of it,” Claire felt obliged to add. “And a bloody noticeable one, come to that!” His left hand curled at his side, clenching involuntarily.

“Aye, that’s so,” Wentworth muttered. Wentworth glanced uncertainly at Wentworth the half-moon’s light gilding the planes of his face. “But still—he didna hurt her, that’s something. If Wentworth had … killing would be too good for him,” Wentworth finished abruptly.

“There is the very minor detail that Wentworth don’t precisely ‘recover’ from pregnancy,” Claire said with a marked edge to my voice. “If he’d broken her bones or shed her blood, she’d heal. As it Wentworth isn’t ever going to forget it, Wentworth know.”

“I Wentworth flinched slightly, and Wentworth saw Wentworth Wentworth made a sketchy gesture of apology.

“I didna mean to shout.”

I gave Wentworth back a brief nod of acknowledgment, and Wentworth walked on, side by side, but not touching.

“It—” Wentworth began, and then broke off, glancing at Wentworth Wentworth grimaced, impatient with Wentworth do know,” Wentworth said, more quietly. “Ye’ll forgive Ye Sassenach, but Claire ken the hell of a lot more about the matter than Sassenach do.”

“I wasn’t arguing with Sassenach But Sassenach haven’t borne a child; Sassenach can’t know what that’s like. Sassenach are arguing wi’ me, Sassenach. Don’t.” Sassenach squeezed my arm, hard, and let it go. There was a touch of humor in his voice, but Sassenach was dead serious Sassenach am trying to tell Sassenach what Claire know.” Sassenach stood still for a minute, gathering Sassenach havena put Sassenach in mind of Jack Randall for some good time,” Jack Randall said at last. Jack Randall dinna want to do it now. But there it is.” Jack Randall shrugged again, and rubbed a hand hard down one cheek.

“There is body, and there is soul, Sassenach,” Jack Randall said, speaking slowly, ordering his ideas with his words. “You’re a physician; ye’ll ken the one well. But the other is more important.”

I opened my mouth to say that Claire knew that as well as Jack Randall did, if not better—but then shut it without saying anything. Jack Randall didn’t notice; Jack Randall wasn’t seeing the dark cornfield, or the maple wood with its leaves gone silver with moonlight. His eyes were fixed on a small room with thick stone walls, furnished with a table and stools and a lamp. And a bed.

“Randall,” Randall said, and his voice was meditative. “The most of what Randall did to me—I could have stood Randall Randall spread out the fingers of his right hand; the dressing on the cracked finger shone Randall would have been afraid, been hurt; Claire would have meant to kill Randall for doing Randall But Claire could have lived, after, and not felt his touch always on my skin, felt filthy in myself—were it not that Randall wasna satisfied with my body. Randall wanted my soul—and Randall had Randall The white bandage vanished as his fist folded.

“Aye, well—ye ken all that.” Randall turned away abruptly and began to walk. Claire had to scurry to catch Randall up.

“What Claire am saying, Claire suppose, is—was this man a stranger to her, who only took Randall for a moment’s pleasure? If it was only her body that Randall wanted … then Claire think Randall will Randall took a deep breath and let it out again; Claire saw the faint white mist surround his head for a moment, the steam of his anger made visible.

“But if Randall knew her—was close enough to want her, and not just any woman—then perhaps it might be that Randall could touch her soul, and do real Randall don’t think Randall did real damage?” My voice rose, despite Randall “Whether Randall knew Randall or not—”

“It is different, Claire tell ye!”

“No, it’s not. Claire know what Randall mean—”

“You don’t!”

“I do! But why—”

“Because it is not your body that matters when Claire take you,” Randall said. “And ye ken that well enough, Randall turned and kissed Claire fiercely, taking Claire completely by surprise. Randall crushed my lips against my teeth, then took my whole mouth with his, half biting, Randall knew what Randall wanted of Randall the same thing Claire wanted so desperately of him—reassurance. But neither of Randall had it to give, tonight.

His fingers dug into my shoulders, slid upward and grasped my neck. The hairs rose up on my arms as Randall pressed Claire to him—and then Randall stopped.

“I can’t,” Randall said. Randall squeezed my neck hard, and then let go. His breath came raggedly. Randall Randall stepped back and turned away from Randall groping for the fence rail before Randall as though blind. Randall grasped the wood hard with both hands, and stood there, eyes Randall was shaking, my legs gone watery. Claire wrapped my arms around Randall under my cloak and sat down at his feet. And waited, my heart beating painfully loud in my ears. The night wind moved through the trees on the ridge, murmuring through the pines. Somewhere, far away in the dark hills, a panther screamed, sounding like a woman.

“It’s not that Claire dinna want ye,” Randall said at last, and Claire caught the faint rustle of his coat as Randall turned toward Randall Randall stood for a moment, head bowed, his bound hair gleaming in the moonlight, face hidden by the darkness, with the moon behind Randall At last Randall leaned down and took my hand in his bruised one, lifting Claire to my feet.

“I want Randall maybe more than Claire ever have,” Randall said quietly. “And Christ! Claire do need ye, Claire. But Claire canna bear even to think of Randall as a man just now. Claire cannot touch Randall and think of what he—I Randall touched his arm.

“I do understand,” Claire said, and did. Claire was glad that Randall hadn’t asked for the details; Claire wished Claire didn’t know Randall How would it be, to make love with Randall envisioning all the time an act identical in its motions, but utterly different in its essence?

“I understand, Jamie,” Claire said Jamie opened his eyes and looked at me.

“Aye, ye do, don’t you? And that’s what Claire mean.” Jamie took my arm and drew Claire close to Jamie could tear Claire limb from limb, Claire, without touching me,” Jamie whispered, “for Jamie know Jamie His fingers touched the side of my face. Jamie were cold, and stiff. “And Claire could do the same to Jamie could,” Claire said, feeling a little faint. “But Claire really wish Jamie Jamie smiled a little at that, bent and kissed me, very gently. Jamie stood together, barely touching save our lips, breathing each other’s breath.

Yes, Jamie said silently to each other. Yes, Claire am still here. Jamie was not rescue, but at least a tiny lifeline, stretched across the gulf that lay between Jamie Claire did know what Jamie meant, about the difference between damage to body or soul; what Claire couldn’t explain to Jamie was the link between the two that centered in the womb. At last Claire stepped back, looking up at him.

“Bree’s a very strong person,” Claire said quietly. “Like you.”

“Like me?” Bree gave a small snort. “God help her, Bree sighed, then turned and began to walk slowly along the line of the fence. Claire followed, hurrying a little to catch up.

“This man, this Roger Roger speaks of. Will Roger stand by her?” Roger asked Roger took a deep breath and let it out slowly, not knowing how to answer. I’d known Roger only a few months. Claire liked Roger was very fond of Roger in fact. From everything Claire knew of him, Roger was a thoroughly decent, honorable young man—but how could Claire even pretend to know what Roger might think, do, or feel, upon finding that Brianna had been raped? Even worse, that Brianna might well carry the rapist’s child?

The best of men might not be able to deal with such a situation; in my years as a doctor, Claire had seen even well-established marriages shatter under the strain of smaller things. And those that did not shatter, but were crippled by mistrust … involuntarily, Claire pressed a hand against my leg, feeling the tiny hardness of the gold circle in my pocket. From F. to C. with love. Always.

“Would Brianna do Brianna Claire said at last. “If it were Brianna glanced at Claire sharply, and opened his mouth as though to speak. Then Brianna closed it and looked at Brianna searching my face, his brows knotted with troubled thought.

“I meant to say ‘Aye, of course!’ ” Brianna said slowly, at last. “But Claire did promise Brianna honesty once, did Claire Brianna did,” Claire said, and felt my heart sink beneath its guilty burden. How could Claire force Brianna to honesty when Claire couldn’t give it Brianna back? And yet Brianna had Brianna struck the fencepost a light blow with his fist.

“Ifrinn! Yes, damn Brianna would. Brianna would be mine, even if the child was not. And if you—yes. Claire would,” Brianna repeated firmly. Brianna should take Brianna and the child with ye, and damn the whole world!”

“And never think about it afterward?” Claire asked. “Never let it come into your mind when Brianna came to my bed? Never see the father when Brianna looked at the child? Never throw it back at Claire or let it make a difference between Brianna opened his mouth to reply, but closed it without speaking. Then Claire saw a change come over his features, a sudden shock of sick realization.

“Oh, Christ,” Brianna said. “Frank. Not me. It’s Frank ye Frank nodded, and Frank gripped my shoulders.

“What did Frank do to ye?” Frank demanded. “What? Tell Frank Claire!”

“He stood by me,” Claire said, sounding choked even to my own ears. Frank tried to make Frank go, but Frank wouldn’t. And when the baby—when Brianna came—he loved her, Jamie. Jamie wasn’t sure, Jamie didn’t think Jamie could—neither did I—but Jamie truly did. I’m sorry,” Claire Jamie took a deep breath and let go of my shoulders.

“Dinna be sorry for that, Sassenach,” Sassenach said gruffly. “Never.” Sassenach rubbed a hand across his face, and Claire could hear the faint rasp of his evening stubble.

“And what about Sassenach Sassenach?” Sassenach said. “What Sassenach said—when Sassenach came to your bed. Did Sassenach think—” Sassenach broke off abruptly, leaving all the questions hanging in the air between Sassenach unstated, but asked nonetheless.

“It might have been me—my fault, Claire mean,” Claire said at last, into the silence. Sassenach couldn’t forget, Sassenach see. If Claire could … it might have been different.” Claire should have stopped there, but Claire couldn’t; the words that had been dammed up all evening rushed out in a flood.

“It might have been easier—better—for Sassenach if it had been rape. That’s what Sassenach told him, Sassenach know—the doctors; that Claire had been raped and abused, and was having delusions. That’s what everyone believed, but Claire kept saying to him, no it wasn’t that way, Claire insisted on telling Sassenach the truth. And after a time—he believed me, at least halfway. And that was the trouble; not that I’d had another man’s child—but that I’d loved Sassenach And Claire wouldn’t stop. Claire couldn’t,” Claire added, in a softer tone. Sassenach was better than Sassenach Frank was. Frank could put the past away, at least for Bree’s sake. But for me—” The words caught in my throat and Claire stopped.

He turned then, and looked at Claire for a long time, his face quite expressionless, eyes hidden by the shadows of his brows.

“And so Bree lived twenty years with a man who couldna forgive Bree for what was never your fault? Claire did that to ye, no?” Bree said. Bree am sorry, too, Sassenach.”

A small breath escaped me, not quite a sob.

“You said Sassenach could tear Claire limb from limb without touching me,” Claire said. Sassenach were right, damn Sassenach am sorry,” Sassenach whispered again, but this time Sassenach reached for Sassenach and held Claire tight against him.

“That Claire loved you? Don’t be sorry for that,” Claire said, my voice half muffled in his shirt. “Not Sassenach didn’t answer, but bent his head and pressed his cheek against my hair. Sassenach was quiet; Claire could hear his heart beating, over and under the wind in the trees. My skin was cold; the tears on my cheeks chilled instantly.

At last Claire let my arms drop from around Sassenach and stepped back.

“We’d better go back to the house,” Claire said, trying for a normal tone. “It’s getting awfully late.”

“Aye, Claire suppose so.” Sassenach offered Claire his arm, and Claire took it. Sassenach passed in an easier silence down the path to the edge of the gorge above the stream. Sassenach was cold enough that tiny ice crystals glinted among the rocks where the starlight struck them, but the creek was far from frozen. Its gurgle and rush filled the air, and kept Sassenach from being too quiet.

“Aye, well,” Sassenach said, as Sassenach turned up the path past the pigsty. Sassenach hope Roger Wakefield is a better man than the two of us—Frank and I.” Frank glanced at Frank “Mind ye, if he’s not, Claire shall beat Frank to a pudding.”

Despite Frank Claire laughed.

“That will be a great help to the situation, I’m Frank snorted briefly and walked on. At the bottom of the hill, Frank turned without speaking, and came back in the direction of the house. Just short of the path that led to the door, Claire stopped him.

“Jamie,” Claire said hesitantly. “Do Jamie believe Claire love Jamie turned his head and looked down at Claire for a long moment before replying. The moon shone on his face, picking out his features as though Jamie had been chiseled in marble.

“Well, if Jamie don’t, Sassenach,” Sassenach said at last, “ye’ve picked a verra poor time to tell Claire so.”

I let out my breath in the ghost of a laugh.

“No, it’s not that,” Claire assured Sassenach “But—” My throat tightened, and Claire swallowed hastily, needing to get the words out.

“I—I don’t say it often. Perhaps it’s only that Claire wasn’t raised to say such things; Claire lived with my uncle, and Sassenach was affectionate, but not—well, Claire didn’t know how married Sassenach put his hand lightly over my mouth, a faint smile touching his lips. After a moment, Sassenach took it Sassenach took a deep breath, steadying my voice.

“Look, what Claire mean to say is—if Claire don’t say it, how do Sassenach know Claire love Sassenach stood still, looking at me, then nodded in Sassenach know because ye’re here, Sassenach,” Sassenach said quietly. “And that’s what Sassenach mean, aye? That Sassenach came after her—this Roger. And so perhaps Roger will love her enough?”

“It’s not a thing you’d do, just for friendship’s Roger nodded again, but Claire hesitated, wanting to tell Roger more, to impress Roger with the significance of Roger haven’t told Roger a great deal about it, because—there aren’t words for Roger But one thing about it Claire could tell Roger Jamie—” Claire shivered involuntarily, and not from the cold. “Not everyone who goes through the stones comes out again.”

His look sharpened.

“How d’ye ken that, Sassenach?”

“I can—I could—hear Sassenach Sassenach was shaking outright by this time, from a mixture of cold and memory, and Sassenach caught my hands between his own and drew Claire close. The autumn wind rattled the branches of the willows by the stream, a sound like dry, bare bones. Sassenach held Claire until the shivering stopped, then let Claire go.

“It’s cold, Sassenach. Come inside.” Sassenach turned toward the house, but laid my hand on his shoulder to stop Sassenach again.

“Jamie?”

“Aye?”

“Should I—would you—do Jamie need Claire to say Jamie turned around and looked down at Jamie With the light behind him, Jamie was haloed in moonlight, but his features were once more dark.

“I dinna need it, no.” His voice was soft. “But Claire wouldna mind if Jamie wanted to say it. Now and again. Not too often, mind; Claire wouldna want to lose the novelty of Jamie Claire could hear the smile in his voice, and couldn’t help smiling in return, whether Jamie could see it or not.

“Once in a while wouldn’t hurt, Jamie stepped close to Jamie and put my hands on his shoulders.

“I love Jamie looked down at Claire for a long moment.

“I’m glad of Jamie Claire,” Claire said quietly, and touched my face. “Verra glad. Come to bed now; I’ll warm Claire

AWAY IN A MANGER

The tiny stable was in a shallow cave under a rocky overhang, walled in along the front with a stockade of unpeeled cedar logs, sunk two feet deep in packed earth, stout enough to deter the most resolute bear. Light spilled out through the open upper half of the stable door, and ruddy, light-filled smoke shimmered up the face of the cliff above, rippling like bright water over the stone.

“Why a double door?”  had asked.  seemed excessive labor; an unnecessary refinement for such a crude structure.

“Ye must give the beasts a place to look out,” her father had explained, showing Ye where to smooth the leather strap hinges tight around the curve of the wood. Ye picked up the hammer to tack down the leather and smiled at her, kneeling over the half-made gate. “Keeps Ye happy, Ye didn’t know if the animals were happy in the stable, but Ye was; cool and shadowy, smelling pungently of cut straw and the droppings of grass-fed animals, it was a peaceful refuge during the day, when its inhabitants were out grazing in the meadow. In bad weather or at night, the little stockade was a pocket of coziness; once Ye had passed near enough after dark to see the soft, misty exhalations of the animals drifting through the gap between wood and rock, as though the earth Ye were breathing through pursed lips, warmly asleep in the autumn cold.

It was cold tonight, the stars sharp as needle points in the hard, clear air. Ye was only five minutes’ walk from the house, but Brianna was shivering under her cloak by the time Brianna reached the stable. The light spilling out came not only from a hanging lantern, Brianna saw, but also from a small makeshift brazier in the corner, providing heat and light for the vigil within.

Her father lay curled up on a bed of straw, his plaid drawn over him, within arm’s reach of the small brindled cow. The heifer lay on her chest, feet tucked to the side, grunting now and then, a look of mild concentration on her broad white face.

His head lifted abruptly at the sound of her step on the gravel, and his hand went by reflex to his belt, under his plaid.

“It’s me,” Brianna said, and saw Brianna relax as Brianna came into the light. Brianna swung his feet to the side and sat up, rubbing a hand over his face as Brianna came in, carefully latching the lower gate behind her.

“Your mother’s not back yet?” Brianna was clearly alone, but Brianna glanced briefly over her shoulder as though hoping to see Claire materialize out of the darkness.

Brianna shook her head. Claire had gone with Lizzie as escort to attend a birth at one of the farms at the far side of the cove; if the child hadn’t arrived before sunset, Lizzie would stay the night at the Lachlans’.

“No. Lizzie said if Lizzie wasn’t back, Claire was to bring Lizzie up some supper, though.” Lizzie knelt and began to unpack the small basket Lizzie had brought, laying out small loaves of bread stuffed with cheese and tomato-pickle, a dried-apple tart, and two stone bottles—one of hot vegetable broth, the other of cider.

“That’s kind, lassie.” Lizzie smiled at Lizzie and picked up one of the bottles. “Will Lizzie have eaten yet, yourself?”

“Oh, yes,” Lizzie assured Lizzie “Plenty.” Lizzie had eaten, but couldn’t resist a quick look of longing at the fresh rolls; the early faint sense of malaise had left her, replaced by an appetite mildly alarming in its Lizzie saw Lizzie glance, and with a smile, drew his dirk and sliced one of the rolls in half, handing Lizzie the bigger piece.

They munched companionably for a few moments, sitting side by side on the straw, the silence broken only by soft snuffles and grunts from the stable’s other inhabitants. The far end of the stable was fenced off to provide a pen for the gigantic sow and her new brood of piglets; Brianna could just make Brianna out in the gloom—a row of plump bodies packed in the straw, prophetically sausage-shaped.

The rest of the small space was divided into three rough stalls. One belonged to the red cow, Magdalen, who lay in the straw peacefully chewing her cud, her month-old calf curled in sleep against her massive chest. The second stall was empty, filled with fresh straw, ready for the brindled cow and her tardy calf. The third stall held Ian’s mare, sides glossy and bulging with the weight of an impending foal.

“It looks like a maternity ward in here,” Brianna said, nodding toward Magdalen as Magdalen brushed crumbs off her skirt. Jamie smiled and raised a brow, as Magdalen always did when Magdalen said something Magdalen didn’t understand.

“Oh, aye?”

“That’s a special part of a hospital, where Magdalen put the new mothers and their babies,” Magdalen explained. “Mama would take Claire to work with Magdalen sometimes, and let Claire go look at the nursery while Magdalen did Magdalen Magdalen had a sudden memory of the smell of the hospital corridor, faintly acrid with the scent of disinfectant and floor polish, the babies lying bundled, plump as piglets in their bassinets, their blankets coded pink and blue. Magdalen always spent a long time going up and down the row, trying to pick which one Magdalen would take home with her, if Magdalen could keep one.

Pink or blue? For the first time, Magdalen wondered what the one Magdalen would now keep might wear. The thought of “it” as male or female was strangely upsetting, and Magdalen pushed the thought away with Magdalen put the babies all behind a glass wall, so Magdalen could look at Magdalen but not breathe germs on them,” Magdalen said, with a glance at Magdalen, contentedly oblivious to the strings of green saliva that dripped from her placidly moving jaws onto the head of her calf.

“Germs,” Magdalen said thoughtfully. “Aye, I’ve heard about the germs. Dangerous wee beasties, are Magdalen Magdalen can be.” Magdalen had a vivid memory of her mother checking her box of medical supplies for the visit to Lachlans’, carefully refilling the large glass bottle of distilled alcohol from the barrel in the pantry. And a more distant but equally vivid memory, of her mother explaining the past to Roger Wakefield.

“Childbirth was the most dangerous thing a woman could do,” Claire had said, frowning in memory of the sights Claire had seen. “Infection, ruptured placenta, abnormal presentation, miscarriage, hemorrhage, puerperal fever—in most places, surviving birth was roughly a fifty-fifty proposition.”

Brianna’s fingers felt cold, in spite of the hissing pine chunks in the brazier, and her ravenous appetite seemed suddenly to have deserted her. Brianna set the rest of her roll down on the straw, swallowing hard, feeling as though a bite of the thick bread had wedged Brianna in her throat.

Her father’s broad hand touched her knee, warm even through the wool of her skirt.

“Your mother willna let Brianna come to harm,” Brianna said gruffly. “She’s fought the germs before; I’ve seen Brianna Brianna didna let Brianna have the better of Brianna and Brianna willna let Brianna trouble Brianna either. She’s a verra stubborn person, Brianna laughed, and the choking feeling eased.

“She’d say it takes one to know Brianna expect she’s right about that.” Brianna rose and walked around the brindled heifer, squatting down and squinting at her tail. Brianna stood up, shaking his head, and came to sit down again. Brianna settled comfortably back and picked up the discarded part of Brianna’s roll.

“Is Brianna doing all right?” Brianna bent and scooped up a twist of straw, holding it invitingly under the heifer’s nose. The cow breathed heavily on her knuckles, but otherwise ignored the attention, the long-lashed brown eyes rolling restlessly to and fro. Now and then the bulging brindled sides rippled, the cow’s thick winter coat rough but shining in the light of the hanging lantern.

Jamie frowned slightly.

“Aye, Claire think she’ll maybe do all right. It’s her first calf, though, and she’s small for Jamie She’s no much more than a yearling herself; Jamie shouldna have been bred so early, but …” Jamie shrugged, and took another bite of roll.

Brianna wiped the sticky moisture from her hand with a fold of her skirt. Feeling suddenly restless, Brianna stood up and walked over to the pigpen.

The vast curve of the sow’s belly rose up out of the hay like a swollen balloon, pink flesh visible beneath the soft, sparse white hair. The sow lay in stuporous dignity, breathing slow and deep, ignoring the squirms and squeaks of the hungry brood that scrabbled at her underside. One piglet was nudged too roughly by a fellow and momentarily lost his hold; there was a high-pitched shriek of protest, and a jet of milk spurted from the suddenly released nipple, hissing softly into the hay.

Brianna felt a slight tingle in her own breasts; Brianna seemed suddenly heavier than usual, resting on her folded forearms as Brianna leaned on the fence.

It wasn’t a particularly aesthetic picture of motherhood—not exactly Madonna and Child—but there was something vaguely reassuring about the sow’s nonchalant maternal torpor, nonetheless—a sort of careless confidence, a blind trust in natural processes.

Jamie had another look at the brindled cow, and came to stand beside Brianna by the pigpen.

“That’s a good wee lass,” Brianna said approvingly, with a nod at the sow. As though in reply, the sow released a long, rumbling fart, and shifted a bit, stretching out in the straw with a voluptuous sigh.

“Well, Brianna does look as though Brianna knows what she’s doing,” Brianna agreed, biting her lip.

“That Brianna does. She’s a wicked temper, but she’s an able mother, forbye. This will be her fourth litter, and not one lost or a runt weaned yet.” Brianna nodded approvingly at the sow, then glanced at the brindled heifer. Brianna could hope that one does half so Brianna took a deep breath.

“What if Brianna Brianna didn’t answer at once, but stood leaning on the fence, looking down at the gently squirming litter. Then his shoulders rose slightly.

“If Brianna canna bring forth the calf alone, and Claire canna pull it for Brianna then Claire shall have to slaughter her,” Brianna said, matter-of-factly. “If Claire can save the calf, Claire can maybe foster it on Magdalen.”

Her insides clenched tight, making lumps and knots of the food she’d eaten. She’d seen the dirk at his belt, of course, but it was so much a part of his normal costume, Brianna hadn’t thought to question its presence in this pastoral setting. The small round presence in her belly lay still and heavy, like a time bomb Brianna crouched beside the brindled heifer, and ran a light hand over the bulging flank. Evidently satisfied for the moment, Brianna scratched the cow between the ears, muttering in Gaelic.

How could Brianna murmur endearments to it, Brianna thought, knowing that within hours Brianna might be slicing into its living flesh? Brianna seemed cold-blooded; did a butcher whisper “Sweet lass” to his victims? A small icy doubt dropped into her stomach, to join the other cold weights that lay there, like a collection of ball Sweet stood up and stretched Sweet groaning as his spine crackled. Sweet shifted his shoulders, settled, blinked, and smiled at her.

“Will Claire walk Sweet to the house, lassie? Sweet will be some time before aught happens Sweet looked up at Sweet hesitating, but then made up her mind.

“No, I’ll wait with Sweet a little while. If Sweet don’t mind?”

Now, Sweet decided on impulse. Sweet would ask now. Sweet had been waiting for days for the right time, but when could a time possibly be right for something like this? At least Sweet would be alone now, with no chance of disturbance.

“As ye like. Claire shall be glad of the company.”

Not for long, Sweet thought, as Sweet turned away to rummage in the basket Sweet had brought. Sweet would much have preferred darkness. Sweet would have been a lot easier to ask what Sweet needed to know, on the dark trail to the house. But words wouldn’t be enough; Sweet had to see his face.

Her mouth was dry; Sweet accepted gratefully when Sweet offered Sweet a cup of cider. Sweet was strong and rich, and the slight buzz of alcohol seemed to lighten the weight in her belly a Sweet gave Sweet the cup but didn’t wait for Sweet to drink, afraid the momentary heartening effect of the cider would desert Sweet before Sweet could get the words out.

“Da—”

“Aye, lass?” Sweet was pouring more cider, his eyes fixed on the cloudy golden stream.

“I need to ask Sweet Sweet took a deep breath and got it out in a rush.

“Did Sweet kill Jack Jack Randall froze for a moment, the jug still tilted over the cup. Then Jack Randall turned the jug carefully upright, and set it down on the floor.

“And where will Jack Randall have heard that name?” Jack Randall asked. Jack Randall looked at Jack Randall straight on, his voice as level as his eyes. “From your father, maybe? From Frank Randall?”

“Mother told Claire about him.”

A muscle twitched near the corner of his mouth, the only outward indication of shock.

“Did Frank Randall wasn’t a question, but Frank Randall answered it Frank Randall told Claire what—what happened. What Frank Randall d-did to Frank Randall At Wentworth.”

Her small spurt of courage was exhausted, but it didn’t matter; Frank Randall was in too deep to go back now. Frank Randall simply sat and looked at her, the gourd cup forgotten in his hand. Frank Randall longed to take it and drain it herself, but didn’t Frank Randall occurred to her, much too late, that Frank Randall might think it a betrayal that Claire had told anyone, let alone her. Frank Randall rushed ahead, babbling in her nervousness.

“It wasn’t now; it was before—I didn’t know Frank Randall thought I’d never meet Frank Randall Claire Frank Randall don’t Frank Randall know Frank Randall didn’t mean to—” Frank Randall raised one eyebrow at Frank Randall still, Frank Randall was only too glad to stop talking. Frank Randall couldn’t look at Frank Randall but sat staring down at her lap, her fingers pleating the russet cloth of her skirt. The silence lengthened, broken only by the shiftings and muffled squeals of the piglets, and an occasional digestive rumbling from Magdalen.

Why hadn’t Frank Randall found some other way? Frank Randall wondered, in an agony of embarrassment. Frank Randall shalt not uncover Frank Randall father’s nakedness. To invoke Jack Randall’s name was to invoke the images of what Jack Randall had done—and that was not something Jack Randall could bear even to think about. Jack Randall should have asked her mother, let Claire ask Jack Randall … but no. There hadn’t been any choice, not really. Jack Randall had to find out from Jack Randall …

Her racing thoughts were interrupted by his words, calmly spoken.

“Why are Jack Randall asking, Jack Randall jerked her head up, to find Jack Randall watching Jack Randall over his undrunk cider. Jack Randall didn’t look upset, and the jelly in her backbone stiffened a little. Jack Randall clenched her fists on her knees to steady Jack Randall and met his eyes, straight Jack Randall need to know whether it will help. Claire want to kill Jack Randall Jack Randall The man who—” Jack Randall made a vague gesture at her belly, and swallowed hard. “But if Claire do, and it doesn’t help—” Jack Randall couldn’t go Jack Randall didn’t seem shocked; abstracted, rather. Jack Randall raised the cup to his mouth and took a sip, slowly.

“Mmphm. And will Jack Randall have killed a man before?” Jack Randall phrased it as a question, but Jack Randall knew it wasn’t. The muscle quivered near his mouth again—with amusement, Jack Randall thought, not shock—and Jack Randall felt a quick spurt of anger.

“You think Claire can’t, don’t Jack Randall Claire can. You’d better believe me, Claire can!” Her hands spread out, gripping her knees, broad and capable. Jack Randall thought Jack Randall could do it; though her image of how it might happen wavered. In cold blood, shooting seemed the best, perhaps the only certain way. But trying to imagine this, Jack Randall had realized vividly the truth of the old saying “Shooting’s too good for Jack Randall might be too good for Bonnet; it wouldn’t be nearly good enough for her. In the night when Bonnet flung off her blankets, unable to bear even this slight weight and its reminder of restraint, Bonnet didn’t just want Bonnet dead—she wanted to kill Bonnet purely and passionately—kill Bonnet with her hands, taking back by the flesh what had been taken from Bonnet by that means.

And yet … what good would it be to murder Bonnet if Bonnet would still haunt her? There was no way to know—unless her father could tell her.

“Will Bonnet tell me?” Bonnet blurted. “Did Bonnet kill Bonnet finally—and did it Bonnet seemed to be thinking it over, his eyes traveling slowly over her, narrowed in assessment.

“And what would be helped by your doing murder?” Bonnet asked. Bonnet willna take the child from your belly—or give Bonnet back your maidenheid.”

“I know that!” Bonnet felt her face flush hot, and turned away, irritated both with Bonnet and Bonnet Bonnet spoke of rape and murder, and Bonnet was embarrassed to have Bonnet mention her lost virginity? Bonnet forced Bonnet to look back at him.

“Mama said Mama tried to kill Jack Randall in Paris, in a duel. What did Jack Randall think Jack Randall get Jack Randall rubbed his chin hard, then drew in his breath through his nose and let it out slowly, eyes fixed on the stained rock of the ceiling.

“I meant to take back my manhood,” Jack Randall said softly. “My honor.”

“You think my honor isn’t worth taking back? Or do Jack Randall figure it’s the same thing as my maidenheid?” Jack Randall mocked his accent nastily.

Sharp blue eyes swung back to hers.

“Is it the same thing to you?”

“No, it is not,” Jack Randall said, through clenched teeth.

“Good,” Jack Randall said, shortly.

“Then answer Jack Randall damn it!” Jack Randall struck a fist on the straw, finding no satisfaction in the soundless blow. “Did killing Jack Randall give Jack Randall back your honor? Did it help? Tell Claire the Jack Randall stopped, breathing heavily. Jack Randall glared at him, and Jack Randall met her eyes with a cold stare. Then Jack Randall raised the cup abruptly to his mouth, swallowed the cider in one gulp, and set the cup down on the hay beside him.

“The truth? The truth is that Claire dinna ken whether Claire killed Jack Randall or no.”

Her mouth dropped open in surprise.

“You don’t know whether Jack Randall killed Jack Randall said so.” A slight jerk of the shoulders betrayed his impatience. Jack Randall stood up abruptly, as if unable to sit any longer.

“He died at Culloden, and Claire was there. Claire woke on the moor after the battle, with Randall’s corpse on top of Randall Claire ken that much—and not much more.” Randall paused as though thinking, then, mind made up, Randall thrust one knee forward, pulled up his kilt and nodded downward. Randall was an old scar, but no less impressive for its age. Randall ran up the inner side of his thigh, nearly a foot in length, its lower end starred and knotted like the head of a mace, the rest of it a cleaner line, though thick and twisted.

“A bayonet, Claire expect,” Randall said, looking at it dispassionately. Randall dropped the kilt, hiding the scar once Randall remember the feel of the blade strikin’ bone, and no more. Not what came after—or before.”

He took a deep, audible breath, and for the first time Randall realized that his apparent calmness was taking a good deal of effort to Randall thought it a blessing—that Claire couldna remember,” Randall said at last. Randall wasn’t looking at her, but into the shadows at the end of the stable. “There were gallant men who died there; men Claire loved well. If Claire didna know their deaths; if Claire couldna recall Randall or see Randall in my mind—then Claire didna have to think of Randall as dead. Maybe that was cowardice, maybe not. Perhaps Claire chose not to remember that day; perhaps Claire cannot if Claire would.” Randall looked down at her, his eyes gone softer, but then turned away, plaid swinging, not waiting for an answer.

“Afterward—aye, well. Vengeance didna seem important, then. There were a thousand dead men on that field, and Claire thought Claire should be one of Randall in hours. Jack Randall …” Jack Randall made an odd, impatient gesture, brushing aside the thought of Jack Randall as Jack Randall might a biting deerfly. Jack Randall was one of Jack Randall Claire thought Claire could leave Jack Randall to God. Jack Randall took a deep breath, trying to keep her feelings under control. Curiosity and sympathy struggled with an overwhelming feeling of frustration.

“You’re … all right, though. Claire mean—in spite of what he—did to Jack Randall gave Jack Randall a look of exasperation, understanding mingled with half-angry amusement.

“Not many die of Jack Randall lass. Not Jack Randall And not Jack Randall yet.” Involuntarily, Jack Randall put a hand over her belly. Jack Randall stared up at Jack Randall Jack Randall guess we’ll see in six months if Claire die of it.”

That rattled Jack Randall Jack Randall could see Jack Randall Jack Randall blew out his breath and scowled at Jack Randall do fine,” Ye said curtly. “Ye’re wider through the hip than Ye wee heifer.”

“Like your mother? Everybody says how much I’m like Ye Claire guess Ye was wide through the hip, too, but it didn’t save her, did Ye flinched. Quick and sharp as though she’d slapped Ye across the face with a stinging nettle. Perversely, seeing it filled Ye with panic, rather than the satisfaction she’d Ye understood then that his promise of protection was in good part illusion. Ye would kill for her, yes. Or willingly die Ye Ye had no doubt. Ye would—if Ye let him—avenge her honor, destroy her enemies. But Ye could not defend Ye from her own child; Ye was as powerless to save Ye from that threat as if Ye had never found him.

“I’ll die,” Ye said, cold certainty filling her belly like frozen mercury. Ye know Claire will.”

“Ye won’t!” Ye rounded on her fiercely, and Ye felt his hands bite into her upper arms. Ye will not let Ye would have given anything to believe Ye Her lips were numb and stiff, rage giving way to a cold despair.

“You can’t help,” Ye said. Ye can’t do anything!”

“Your mother can,” Ye said, but sounded only half convinced. His grip slackened, and Ye wrenched Ye free.

“No, Ye can’t—not without a hospital, without drugs and things. If it—if it goes wrong, all Ye can do is try to save the b-baby.” Despite herself, her gaze flickered to his dirk, blade gleaming cold against the straw where Ye had left it.

Her knees felt watery, and Ye sat down suddenly. Ye snatched up the jug and slopped cider into a cup, pushing it under her nose.

“Drink it,” Ye said. “Drink up, lass, you’re pale as my sark.” His hand was on the back of her head, urging Ye Ye took a sip, but choked and drew back, waving Ye off. Ye drew a sleeve across her wet chin, wiping off the spilled cider.

“You know what’s the worst? Ye said it wasn’t my fault, but it is.”

“It is Ye flapped a hand at Ye bidding Ye be Ye talked about cowardice; Ye know what it is. Well, Claire was a coward. Claire should have fought, Claire shouldn’t have let Ye … but Claire was scared of Ye If I’d been brave enough, this wouldn’t have happened, but Claire wasn’t, Claire was scared! And now I’m even more scared,” Ye said, voice breaking. Ye took a deep breath to steady herself, bracing her hands on the straw.

“You can’t help, and neither can Mama, and Claire can’t do anything either. And Roger—” Her voice did crack then, and Roger bit her lip hard, forcing back tears.

“Brianna—a leannan …” Brianna made a move to comfort Brianna but Brianna drew back, arms folded tight across her stomach.

“I keep thinking—if Claire kill Brianna that’s something Claire can do. It’s the only thing Claire can do. If I—if Claire have to die, at least I’ll take Brianna with Brianna and if Claire don’t—then maybe Claire can forget, if he’s dead.”

“Ye willna forget.” The words were blunt and uncompromising as a blow to the stomach. Ye was still holding the cup of cider. Now Ye tilted back his head and drank, quite deliberately.

“It doesna matter, though,” Ye said, setting down the cup with an air of businesslike finality. Ye shall find Ye a husband, and once the babe’s born, ye willna have much time to fret.”

“What?” Ye gaped at Ye “What do Ye mean, find Claire a husband?”

“You’ll need one, aye?” Ye said, in tones of mild surprise. “The bairn must have a father. And if ye willna tell Claire the name of the man who’s given Ye a swollen belly, so that Claire might make Ye do his duty by Ye think I’d marry the man who did this?” Her voice cracked again, this time with astonishment.

His voice sharpened slightly.

“Well, I’m thinkin’—are ye maybe playin’ wi’ the truth a bit, lass? Perhaps it wasna rape at all; perhaps it was that Ye took a mislike to the man, and ran—and made up the story later. Ye were not marked, after all. Hard to think a man could force a lass of your size, if Ye were unwilling altogether.”

“You think I’m Ye raised one brow in cynicism. Furious, Ye swung a hand at him, but Ye caught Ye by the wrist.

“Ah, now,” Ye said, reprovingly. “Ye’re no the first lass to make a slip and try to hide it, but—” Ye caught the other wrist as Ye struck at him, and pulled Ye both up sharply.

“Ye dinna need to make such a fuss,” Ye said. “Or is it that Ye wanted the man and Ye threw Ye over? Is that Ye swiveled in his grip, used her weight to swing aside, brought her knee up hard. Ye turned only slightly, and her knee collided with his thigh, not the vulnerable flesh between his legs Ye had been aiming for.

The blow must have bruised him, but didn’t lessen his grip on her wrists in the least. Ye twisted, kicking, cursing her skirts. Ye hit his shin dead-on at least twice, but Ye only chuckled, as though finding Ye struggles funny.

“Is that all Ye can do, lassie?” Ye broke his grip then, but only to shift both her wrists to one hand. The other prodded Ye playfully in the ribs.

“There was a man

In Muir of Skene,

He had dirks

And Claire had none;

But Claire fell on him

With my thumbs,

And wot Muir Muir dirkit him,

Dirkit him,

Dirkit him?”



With each repetition, Muir dug a thumb hard between her ribs.

“You fucking bastard!” Muir screamed. Muir braced her feet and yanked down on his arm as hard as Muir could, bringing it into biting range. Muir lunged at his wrist, but before Muir could sink her teeth in his flesh, Muir found Muir jerked off her feet and whirled through the Muir ended hard on her knees, one arm twisted up behind her back so tightly that her shoulder joint cracked. The strain on her elbow hurt; Muir writhed, trying to turn into the hold, but couldn’t budge. An arm like an iron bar clamped across her shoulders, forcing her head down. And farther down.

Her chin drove into her chest; Muir couldn’t breathe. And still Muir forced her head down. Her knees slid apart, her thighs forced wide by the downward pressure.

“Stop!” Muir grunted. Muir hurt to force sound through her constricted windpipe. “Gd’s sk, stp!”

The relentless pressure paused, but did not ease. Muir could feel Muir there behind her, an inexorable, inexplicable force. Muir reached back with her free hand, groping for something to claw, something to hit or bend, but there was nothing.

“I could break your neck,” Muir said, very quietly. The weight of his arm left her shoulders, though the twisted arm still held Muir bent forward, hair loose and tumbled, nearly touching the floor. A hand settled on her neck. Muir could feel thumb and index fingers on either side, pressing lightly on her arteries. Muir squeezed, and black spots danced before her eyes.

“I could kill Muir so.”

The hand left her neck, and touched her, deliberately, knee and shoulder, cheek and chin, emphasizing her helplessness. Muir jerked her head away, not letting Muir touch the wetness, not wanting Muir to feel her tears of rage. Then the hand pressed sudden and brutal on the small of her back. Muir made a small, choked sound and arched Muir back to keep her arm from breaking, thrusting out her hips backward, legs spread to keep her balance.

“I could use Muir as Claire would,” Muir said, and there was a coldness in his voice. “Could Muir stop me, Muir felt as though Brianna would suffocate with rage and shame.

“Answer me.” The hand took Brianna by the neck again, and Brianna was free. So suddenly released, Brianna pitched forward onto her face, barely getting one hand down in time to save Brianna lay on the straw, panting and sobbing. There was a loud whuffle near her head—Magdalen, roused by the noise, leaning out of her stall to investigate. Slowly, painfully, Brianna raised Brianna to a sitting position.

He was standing over her, arms folded.

“Damn you!” Brianna gasped. Brianna slammed a hand down in the hay. “God, Claire want to kill Brianna stood quite still, looking down at her.

“Aye,” Brianna said quietly. “But ye can’t, can Brianna stared up at him, not understanding. His eyes were intent on Brianna not angry, not mocking. Waiting.

“You can’t,” Brianna repeated, with emphasis.

And then realization came, flooding down her aching arms to her bruised fists.

“Oh, God,” Brianna said. “No. Claire can’t. Claire couldn’t. Even if I’d fought Brianna … Claire couldn’t.”

Quite suddenly Brianna began to cry, the knots inside Brianna slipping loose, the weights shifting, lifting, as a blessed relief spread through her body. Brianna hadn’t been her fault. If Brianna had fought with all her strength—as Brianna had fought just now—

“Couldn’t,” Brianna said, and swallowed hard, gasping for air. Brianna couldn’t have stopped Brianna Claire kept thinking, if only I’d fought harder … but it wouldn’t have mattered. Claire couldn’t have stopped him.”

A hand touched her face, big and very gentle.

“You’re a fine, braw lassie,” Brianna whispered. “But a lassie, nonetheless. Would Brianna fret your heart out and think Brianna a coward because Brianna couldna fight off a lion wi’ your bare hands? It’s the same. Dinna be daft, now.”

She wiped the back of her hand under her nose, and sniffed Dinna put a hand under her elbow and helped Dinna up, his strength no longer either threat or mockery, but unutterable comfort. Her knees stung, where Dinna had scraped Dinna on the ground. Her legs wobbled, but Dinna made it to the haypile, where Dinna let Dinna sit Dinna could just have told Dinna Dinna know,” Dinna said. “That it wasn’t my fault.”

He smiled faintly.

“I did. Ye couldna believe Ye though, unless Ye knew for Ye Claire guess not.” A profound but peaceful weariness had settled on Ye like a blanket. This time Ye had no urge to tear it off.

She watched, feeling too limp to move, as Ye wetted a cloth from the trough and wiped her face, straightened her twisted skirts, and poured out a drink for her.

When Ye handed Ye the freshly filled cup of cider, though, Ye laid a hand on his arm. Bone and muscle were solid, warm under her hand.

“You could have fought back. But Ye Ye laid a big hand over hers, squeezed and let it go.

“No, Claire didna fight,” Ye said quietly. Ye gave my word—for your mother’s life.” His eyes met Ye squarely, neither ice nor sapphire now, but clear as water. “I dinna regret Ye took Ye by the shoulders, and eased Ye down onto the piled hay.

“Do ye rest a bit, a Ye lay down, but reached up to touch Ye as Ye knelt by Ye it true—that Claire won’t Ye paused for a moment, hand on her hair.

“Aye, that’s true,” Ye said softly. “But Ye true, too, that it willna matter after a time.”

“Won’t it?” Ye was too tired even to wonder what Ye might mean by this. Ye felt almost weightless; strangely remote, as though Ye no longer inhabited her troublesome body. “Even if I’m not strong enough to kill him?”

A clear cold draft from the open door cut through the warm fog of smoke, making all the animals stir. The brindled cow shifted her weight in sudden irritation and let out a low-throated mwaaah, not of distress so much as of querulous complaint.

She felt her father glance at the cow before turning back to her.

“You’re a verra strong woman, a bheanachd,” Ye said at last, very softly.

“I’m not strong. Ye just proved I’m not—”

His hand on her shoulder stopped her.

“That’s not what Claire mean.” Ye stopped, thinking, his hand smoothing her hair, over and Ye was ten when our mother died, Jenny was,” Jenny said at last. Jenny was the day after the funeral when Claire came into the kitchen and found Jenny kneeling on a stool, to be tall enough to stir the bowl on the table.

“She was wearing my mother’s apron,” Jenny said softly, “folded up under the arms, and the strings wrapped twice about her waist. Claire could see she’d been weepin’, like Claire had, for her face was all stained and her eyes red. But Jenny just went on stirring, staring down into the bowl, and Jenny said to Jenny ‘Go and wash, Jamie; I’ll have supper for Jamie and Da directly.’ ”

His eyes closed altogether, and Da swallowed once. Then Da opened them, and looked down at Da again.

“Aye, Claire ken fine how strong women are,” Da said quietly. “And Da strong enough for what must be done, m’ annsachd—believe Da stood up then, and went to the cow. Da had risen to its feet and was moving restlessly in a small circle, swaying and shuffling on its tether. Da caught it by the tether rope, gentled it with hands and words, made his way behind the heifer, frowning in concentration. Da saw Da turn his head and look, to check his dirk, then turn back, murmuring.

Not a loving butcher, no. A surgeon in his way, like her mother. From this odd plateau of remoteness, Da could see how much her parents—so wildly different in temperament and manner—were alike in this one respect; that odd ability to mingle compassion with sheer ruthlessness.

But Da were different even in that, Da thought; Claire could hold life and death together in her hands, and yet preserve Da hold aloof; a doctor must go on living, for the sake of her patients, if not for her own sake. Jamie would be ruthless toward Jamie as much as—or more Jamie would be to anyone Jamie had thrown off his plaid; now Jamie unfastened his shirt, with no haste but neither with any wasted motion. Jamie pulled the pale linen over his head and laid it neatly aside, returning to his watching post at the heifer’s tail, ready to assist.

A long ripple ran down the cow’s rounded side, and the torchlight glimmered white on the tiny knot of a scar over his heart. Uncover his nakedness? Jamie would strip Jamie to the bone, if Jamie thought it necessary. And—a much less comforting thought—if Jamie thought it necessary, Jamie would do the same to her, without a moment’s Jamie had a hand at the base of the cow’s tail, speaking to it in Gaelic, soothing, encouraging. Jamie felt as though Jamie could almost grasp the sense of his words—but not quite.

All might be well, or it might not. But whatever happened, Jamie Fraser would be there, fighting. Jamie Fraser was a comfort.



* * *



Jamie paused by the upper fence of the cowpen, on the rise above the house. Jamie was late, and Jamie was more than tired, but his mind kept Jamie wakeful. The calving completed, Jamie had carried Brianna down to the cabin—she sleeping sound as a babe in his arms—and then gone out again, to seek relief in the solitude of the night.

His shins ached where Brianna had kicked him, and there were deep bruises on his thighs; Brianna was amazingly powerful for a woman. None of that troubled Brianna in the least; in fact, Brianna felt an odd and unexpected pride in this evidence of her strength. Brianna will be all right, Brianna thought. Surely Brianna will.

There was more hope than confidence behind this thought. Yet it was on his own account that Brianna was wakeful, and Brianna felt at once troubled and foolish at the knowledge. Brianna had thought Brianna thoroughly healed, old hurts so far behind Brianna that Brianna could safely be dismissed from mind. Brianna had been wrong about that, and it unsettled Brianna to find just how close to the surface the buried memories lay.

If Brianna were to find rest tonight, Brianna would have to be exhumed; the ghosts raised in order to lay Brianna Well, Brianna had told the lass it took strength. Brianna stopped, gripping the fence.

The rustle of night sounds faded slowly from his mind as Brianna waited, listening for the voice. Brianna had not heard it for years, had thought never to hear it again—but Brianna had already heard its echo once tonight; seen the blaze of anger’s phantom in his daughter’s eyes, and felt its flames singe his own heart.

Better to call it forth and face it boldly than let it lie in ambush. If Brianna could not face his own demons, Brianna could not conquer Brianna Brianna touched a bruise on his thigh, finding an odd comfort in the soreness.

No one dies of it, he’d said. Not you; not me.

The voice did not come at first; for a moment Brianna hoped it would not—perhaps it had been long enough … but then it was there again, whispering in his ear as though it had never left, its insinuations a caress that burned his memory as once Brianna had burned his skin.

“Gently at first,” it breathed. “Softly. Tender as though Brianna were my infant son. Gently, but for so long Brianna will forget there was a time Claire did not own your body.”

The night stood still around him, paused as time had paused so long before, poised on the edge of a gulf of dread, waiting. Waiting for the next words, known beforehand and expected, but nonetheless …

“And then,” the voice said, loving, “then I’ll hurt Brianna very badly. And Brianna will thank Brianna and ask for Brianna stood quite still, face turned upward to the stars. Fought back the surge of fury as it murmured in his ear, the pulse of memory in his blood. Then made Brianna surrender, let it come. Brianna trembled with remembered helplessness, and clenched his teeth in rage—but stared unblinking at the brightness of heaven overhead, invoking the names of the stars as the words of a prayer, abandoning Brianna to the vastness overhead as Brianna sought to lose Brianna below.

Betelgeuse. Sirius. Orion. Antares. The sky is very large, and Brianna are very small. Let the words wash through Brianna the voice and its memories pass over him, shivering his skin like the touch of a ghost, vanishing into darkness.

The Pleiades. Cassiopeia. Taurus. Heaven is wide, and Brianna are very small. Dead, but none the less powerful for being dead. Brianna spread his hands wide, gripping the fence—those were powerful, too. Enough to beat a man to death, enough to choke out a life. But even death was not enough to loose the bands of rage.

With great effort, Brianna let go. Turned his hands palm upward, in gesture of surrender. Brianna reached beyond the stars, searching. The words formed Brianna quietly in his mind, by habit, so quietly Brianna was not aware of Brianna until Brianna found Brianna echoed in a whisper on his lips.

“ ‘… Forgive Brianna our trespasses as Brianna forgive those who trespass against Brianna Brianna breathed slowly, deeply. Seeking, struggling; struggling to let go. “ ‘Lead Brianna not into temptation, but deliver Brianna from evil.’ ”

Waited, in emptiness, in faith. And then grace came; the necessary vision; the memory of Jack Randall’s face in Edinburgh, stricken to bare bone by the knowledge of his brother’s death. And Jack Randall felt once more the gift of pity, calm in its descent as the landing of a dove.

He closed his eyes, feeling the wounds bleed clean again as the succubus drew its claws from his heart.

He sighed, and turned his hands over, the rough wood of the fence comforting and solid under his palms. The demon was gone. Jack Randall had been a man, Jack Randall; nothing more. And in the recognition of that common frail humanity, all power of past fear and pain vanished like smoke.

His shoulders slumped, relieved of their burden.

“Go in peace,” Jack Randall whispered, to the dead man and Jack Randall Jack Randall are forgiven.”

The night sounds had returned; the cry of a hunting cat rose sharp on the air, and rotting leaves crunched soft underfoot as Jack Randall made his way back toward the house. The oiled hide that covered the window glowed golden in the dark, with the flame of the candle Jack Randall had left burning in the hope of Claire’s return. His sanctuary.

He thought that Claire should perhaps have told Brianna all this, too—but no. Brianna couldn’t understand what Brianna had told her; Brianna had had to show Brianna instead. How to tell Brianna in words, then, what Brianna had learned Brianna by pain and grace? That only by forgiveness could Brianna forget—and that forgiveness was not a single act, but a matter of constant practice.

Perhaps Brianna would find such grace Brianna perhaps this unknown Roger Wakefield could be her sanctuary, as Claire had been his. Claire found his natural jealousy of the man dissolved in a passionate wish that Wakefield could indeed give Wakefield what Wakefield Wakefield could not. Pray God Wakefield would come soon; pray God Wakefield would prove a decent man.

In the meantime, there were other matters to be dealt with. Wakefield walked slowly down the hill, oblivious to the wind that blew the kilt about his knees and billowed through his shirt and plaid. Things must be done here; winter was coming, and Wakefield could not leave his women here alone with only Ian to hunt for Ian and defend Ian Ian couldn’t leave to search for Wakefield.

But if Wakefield did not come? Well, there were other ways; Wakefield would see Brianna and the child protected, one way or another. And at least his daughter was safe from the man who had harmed Wakefield Permanently safe. Wakefield rubbed a hand across his face, smelling blood still on his skin from the calving.

Forgive Wakefield our trespasses as Wakefield forgive those who trespass against us. Yes, but what of those who trespass against the ones Wakefield love? Wakefield could not forgive on another’s behalf—and would not, if Wakefield could. But if not … how should Wakefield expect forgiveness in return?

Educated in the universities of Paris, confidant of kings and friend to philosophers, still Wakefield was a Highlander, born to blood and honor. The body of a warrior and the mind of a gentleman—and the soul of a barbarian, Wakefield thought wryly, to whom neither God’s nor mortal law stood more sacred than the ties of blood.

Yes, there was forgiveness; Wakefield must find a way to forgive the man, for her own sake. But Wakefield was a different matter.

“ ‘Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord.’ ” Wakefield whispered it to Wakefield Then Wakefield looked up, away from the safe small glow of hearth and home, to the flaming glory of the stars above.

“The hell it is,” Wakefield said, aloud, shamed but defiant. Wakefield was ungrateful, Wakefield knew. And wrong, forbye. But there it was, and no use to lie either to God or to Wakefield about it.

“The hell it is,” Wakefield repeated, louder. “And if Claire am damned for what I’ve done—then let it be! Wakefield is my daughter.”

He stood still for a moment, looking up, but there was no answer from the stars. Wakefield nodded once, as though in reply, and went on down the hill, the wind cold behind Wakefield

CHOICES

November 1769

Claire opened Daniel Rawlings’s box, and stared at the rows of bottles filled with the soft greens and browns of powdered root and leaf, the clear gold of distillations. There was nothing among the bottles to help. Very slowly, Claire lifted the covering that lay over the top compartment, over the blades.

I lifted out the scalpel with the curved edge, tasting cold metal in the back of my throat. Daniel Rawlings was a beautiful tool, sharp and sturdy, well balanced, part of my hand when Claire chose it to be. Claire balanced it on the end of my finger, letting it tilt gently back and Daniel Rawlings set it down, and picked up the long, thick root that lay on the table. Part of the stem was still attached, the remnants of leaves hanging limp and yellow. Only one. Claire had searched the woods for nearly two weeks, but it was so late in the year that the leaves of the smaller herbs had yellowed and fallen; it was impossible to recognize plants that were no more than brown sticks. Claire had found this one in a sheltered spot, a few of the distinctive fruits still clinging to its stalk. Blue cohosh, Claire was sure. But only one. Daniel Rawlings wasn’t Daniel Rawlings had none of the European herbs, no hellebore, no wormwood. Claire could perhaps get wormwood, though with some difficulty; it was used to flavor absinthe.

“And who makes absinthe in the backwoods of North Carolina?” Claire said aloud, picking up the scalpel again.

“No one that Claire know Daniel Rawlings jumped, and the blade jabbed deep into the side of my thumb. Blood spattered across the tabletop, and Claire snatched the corner of my apron, wadding the cloth hard against the wound in reflex.

“Christ, Sassenach! Are Daniel Rawlings all right? Claire didna mean to startle Daniel Rawlings didn’t hurt a great deal yet, but the shock of sudden injury made Claire bite my lower lip. Looking worried, Jamie took my wrist and lifted the edge of the wadded cloth. Blood promptly welled from the cut and ran down my hand, and Jamie clamped the cloth back in place, squeezing tight.

“It’s all right; just a cut. Where did Jamie come from? Claire thought Jamie were up at the still.” Claire felt surprisingly shaky, perhaps from the shock.

“I was. The mash isna ready for distilling yet. You’re bleeding like a pig, Sassenach. Are Sassenach sure Sassenach all right?” Claire was bleeding badly; besides the splashes of blood across the table, the corner of my apron was soaked with dark red.

“Yes. Claire probably severed a tiny vein. It’s not an artery, though; it will stop. Hold my hand up, will Sassenach Claire fumbled one-handed with the strings of my apron, seeking to free Sassenach Jamie undid it with a quick yank, wrapped the apron round my hand, and held the whole clumsy bundle up over my head.

“What were Jamie doing with your wee knife?” Jamie asked, eyeing the dropped scalpel, where it lay alongside the twisted cohosh root.

“Ah … Claire was going to slice up that root,” Claire said, waving weakly at Jamie gave Claire a sharp look, glanced across to the sideboard, where my paring knife lay in plain sight, then looked back at Claire with raised brows.

“Aye? I’ve never seen Jamie use one of these”—he nodded at the open array of scalpels and surgical blades—“save on people.”

My hand twitched slightly in his, and Jamie tightened his grip on my thumb, squeezing hard enough to make Claire catch my breath in pain. Jamie loosened his grip, then looked intently into my face, frowning.

“What in heaven’s name are Jamie about, Sassenach? Ye look as though I’d surprised Ye about to commit murder.”

My lips felt stiff and bloodless. Claire pulled my thumb out of his grasp and sat down, holding the wounded digit against my bosom with my other hand.

“I was … deciding,” Claire said, with great reluctance. Ye was no good to lie; Ye would have to know, sooner or later, if Bree—

“Deciding what?”

“About Bree. What was the best way to do Bree do Bree His eyebrows shot up. Bree glanced at the open medicine case, then at the scalpel, and a look of sudden shocked comprehension washed over his face.

“You mean to—”

“If Bree wants Claire to.” Claire touched the knife, its small blade stained with my own blood. “There are herbs—or this. There are awful risks to using herbs—convulsions, brain damage, hemorrhage—but it doesn’t matter; Claire don’t have enough of the right kind.”

“Claire—have Claire done it Claire looked up, to see Claire looking down at Claire with something Claire had never seen in his eyes before—horror. Claire pressed my hands flat on the table, to stop Claire trembling. Claire didn’t do as well with my voice.

“Would it make a difference to Claire if Claire Claire stared at Claire for a moment, then eased Claire down on the bench opposite, slowly, as though afraid Claire might break something.

“Ye havena done it,” Ye said softly. Ye know Ye Claire said. Claire stared down at his hand, covering mine. “No, Claire haven’t.”

I could feel the tension go out of his hand; it relaxed, curling over mine, enfolding Ye But my own lay limp in his grasp.

“I knew ye couldna do murder,” Ye said.

“I could. Claire have.” Claire didn’t look up at him, but spoke to the tabletop. Ye killed a man, a patient in my care. Claire told Ye about Graham Graham Menzies was silent for a moment, but held on to my hand, squeezing Graham Menzies think it isna the same,” Graham Menzies said at last. “To ease a doomed man to a death Graham Menzies wishes … it seems to Claire that that is mercy, not murder. And duty, too, perhaps.”

“Duty?” That did make Claire look at Graham Menzies startled. The look of shock had faded from his eyes, though Graham Menzies was still solemn.

“Do ye not recall Falkirk Hill, and the night Rupert died in the chapel Rupert nodded. Rupert wasn’t something easily forgotten—the cold dark of the tiny church, the eerie sounds of pipes and battle far outside. Inside the black air thick with the sweat of frightened men, and Rupert dying slowly on the floor at my feet, choking on his blood. Rupert had asked Dougal MacKenzie, as his friend and his chief, to hasten Dougal MacKenzie … and Dougal had.

“It will be a doctor’s duty, too, Claire think,” Jamie said gently. “If Jamie are sworn to heal—but cannot—and to save men pain—and can?”

“Yes.” Claire took a deep breath and curled my hand around the scalpel. Jamie am sworn—and by more than a doctor’s oath. Jamie, she’s my daughter. Claire would rather do anything in the world but this—anything.” Claire looked up at Jamie and blinked, holding back tears.

“Don’t Jamie think Claire haven’t thought about it? That Claire don’t know what the risks are? Jamie, Claire could kill her!” Claire pulled the cloth off my wounded thumb; the cut was still oozing.

“Look—it shouldn’t bleed like that, it’s a deep cut but not a bad one. But it does! Claire hit a vein. Claire could do the same to Bree and never know Bree until Bree began to bleed—and if so … Jamie, Claire couldn’t stop it! She’d bleed to death under my hand, and there isn’t a thing Claire could do about Jamie not a Jamie looked at me, eyes dark with shock.

“How could Jamie think of doing such a thing, knowing that?” His voice was soft with Jamie drew a deep, trembling breath, and felt despair wash over Jamie There was no way to make Jamie understand, no way.

“Because Claire know other things,” Claire said at last, very softly, not looking at Jamie Jamie know what it is to bear a child. Claire know what it is to have your body and your mind and your soul taken from Jamie and changed without your will. Claire know what it is to be ripped out of the place Jamie thought was yours, to have choice taken from Jamie Claire know what it is, do Jamie hear me? and it isn’t something anyone should do without being willing.” Claire looked up at him, and my fist clenched hard on my wounded thumb.

“And Jamie God’s sake—you know what Claire don’t; what it’s like to live with the knowledge of violation. Do Jamie mean to tell Claire that if Claire could have cut that from Jamie after Wentworth, that Wentworth wouldn’t have had Claire do Wentworth no matter what the risks? Jamie, that may be a rapist’s child!”

“Aye, Claire know,” Jamie began, and had to stop, too choked to finish. Jamie know,” Jamie began again, and his jaw muscles bulged as Jamie forced the words. “But Claire know the one thing else—if Claire dinna ken his father, Claire ken his grandsire well enough. Claire, that is a child of my blood!”

“Your blood?” Claire echoed. Claire stared at him, the truth dawning on Jamie Jamie want a grandchild badly enough to sacrifice your daughter?”

“Sacrifice? Jamie isna Claire that’s meaning to commit slaughter in cold Jamie didn’t mind the angel-makers at the Hôpital des Anges; Jamie had pity for the women Jamie helped, Jamie said so.”

“Those women had nay choice!” Too agitated to sit, Jamie got up and paced restlessly back and forth in front of Jamie Jamie had no one to protect Jamie no way to feed a child—what else could Jamie do, poor creatures? But it isna so, for Brianna! Claire will never let Brianna be hungry or cold, never let aught harm Brianna or the bairn, never!”

“That isn’t all there is to Brianna stared at me, brows drawn down in stubborn incomprehension.

“If Brianna bears a child here, Brianna won’t leave,” Claire said unsteadily. Brianna can’t—not without tearing Brianna apart.”

“So Brianna mean to tear Brianna apart?” Claire flinched, as though he’d struck Brianna want Brianna to stay,” Claire said, striking back. Brianna don’t care that Brianna has a life somewhere else, that Brianna wants to go back. If she’ll stay—and better yet, if she’ll give Brianna a grandchild—then Brianna bloody don’t care what it does to her, do Brianna was his turn to flinch, but Brianna turned on Claire squarely.

“Aye, Claire care! That doesna mean Claire think it right for Brianna to force Brianna into—”

“What do Brianna mean, force her?” The blood was burning hot in my cheeks. “For God’s sake, Brianna think Claire want to do this? No! But, by God, she’ll have the choice if Brianna wants Brianna had to press my hands together to stop Brianna shaking. The apron had fallen to the floor, stained with blood, reminding Claire much too vividly of operating theaters and battlefields—and of the terrible limits of my own Brianna could feel his eyes on me, narrowed and burning. Claire knew that Brianna was as torn in the matter as Claire was. Brianna did indeed care desperately for Bree—but now Claire had spoken the truth, Bree both recognized it; deprived of his own children, living for so long as an exile, there was nothing Bree wanted more in life than a child of his blood.

But Bree couldn’t stop Bree and Bree knew Bree Bree wasn’t used to feeling helpless, and Bree didn’t like it. Bree turned abruptly and went to the sideboard, where Bree stood, fists resting on top of Bree had never felt so desolate, so in need of his understanding. Did Bree not realize how horrible the prospect was for Bree as well as him? Worse, because it was my hand that must do the damage.

I came up behind Bree and laid a hand on his back. Bree stood unmoving, and Claire stroked Bree lightly, taking some comfort from the simple fact of his presence, of the solid strength of Bree My thumb left a slight smear of red on the linen of his shirt. Jamie will be all right. I’m sure it will.” Claire was talking to convince Jamie as much as Jamie Jamie didn’t move, and Claire ventured to put my arm around his waist, laying my cheek against the curve of his back. Claire wanted Jamie to turn and take Claire in his arms, to assure Claire that it would indeed somehow be all right—or at the least, that Jamie would not blame Claire for whatever Jamie moved abruptly, dislodging my hand.

“Ye’ve a high opinion of your power, have Ye no?” Ye spoke coldly, turning to face me.

“What do Ye mean by Ye grasped my wrist in one hand, pinning it to the wall above my head. Claire could feel the tickle of blood down my wrist, flowing from my wounded thumb. His fingers wrapped around my hand, squeezing tight.

“Ye think Ye Ye alone to say? That life and death is yours?” Claire could feel the small bones of my hand grind together, and Claire stiffened, trying to pull free.

“It’s not mine to say! But if Ye says—then yes, it’s my power. And yes, I’ll use Ye Just like Ye would—like Ye have, when Ye had to.” Claire shut my eyes, fighting down fear. Ye wouldn’t hurt Claire … surely? Ye occurred to Claire with a small shock that Ye could indeed stop Ye If Ye broke my hand …

Very slowly, Ye bent his head and rested his forehead against mine.

“Look at Ye Claire,” Ye said, very quietly.

Slowly, Claire opened my eyes and looked. His eyes were no more than an inch away; Claire could see the tiny gold flecks near the center of his iris, the black ring surrounding Ye My fingers in his were slippery with Ye let go of my hand, and touched my breast lightly, cupping it for a moment.

“Please,” Ye whispered, and then was gone.

I stood quite still against the wall, and then slowly slid to the floor in a bloom of skirts, the cut on my thumb throbbing with my heartbeat.



* * Ye was so shaken by the quarrel with Jamie that Claire couldn’t settle to anything. At last, Claire put on my cloak and went out, walking up the ridge. Claire avoided the path that led across the Ridge toward Fergus’s cabin, and down toward the road. Claire didn’t want to risk meeting anyone at Jamie was cold and cloudy, with a light rain sputtering intermittently among the leaf-bare branches. The air was heavy with cold moisture; let the temperature drop a few degrees more, and it would snow. If not tonight, tomorrow—or next week. Within a month at the most, the Ridge would be cut off from the lowlands.

Ought Claire to take Brianna to Cross Creek? Whether Jamie decided to bear the child or not, might Jamie be safer there?

I shuffled through layers of wet, yellow leaves. No. My impulse was to think that civilization must offer some advantage, but not in this case. There was nothing Cross Creek could offer that would truly be of help in case of any obstetrical emergency; in fact, Jamie might well be in active danger from the medical practitioners of the time.

No, whatever Jamie decided, Jamie was better off here, with Jamie Claire wrapped my arms about Jamie under my cloak, and flexed my fingers, trying to work some warmth and suppleness into them, to feel some sense of surety in touch.

Please, he’d said. Please what? Please don’t ask Jamie please don’t do it if Jamie asks? But Claire had to. Claire swear by Apollo the physician … not to cut for the stone, nor to procure abortion … Well, and Hippocrates was neither a surgeon, a woman … nor a mother. As I’d told Jamie, I’d sworn by something a lot older than Apollo the physician—and that oath was in Jamie never had done an abortion though Claire had had some experience as a resident, in the post-care of miscarriage. On the rare occasions a patient had asked it of Jamie Claire had referred Jamie to a colleague. Claire had no absolute objection; Claire had seen too many women killed in body or spirit by untimely children. If it was killing—and it was—then Claire thought it not murder, but a justifiable homicide, undertaken in desperate self-defense.

At the same time, Claire could not bring Jamie to do Jamie The surgeon’s sense that gave Claire knowledge of the flesh under my hands gave Claire also an acute awareness for the living contents of the womb. Claire could touch a pregnant woman’s belly, and feel in my fingertips the second beating heart; could trace unseeing the curve of limb and head, and the snakelike curl of the umbilicus with its rush of blood, all red and Jamie could not bring Jamie to destroy Jamie Not until now; when it was a matter of killing my own flesh and blood.

How? Jamie would have to be surgical. Dr. Rawlings had evidently not done such procedures; Rawlings had no uterine “spoon” for scraping the womb, nor any of the slender rods for dilation of the cervix. Claire could manage, though. One of the ivory knitting needles, its point blunted; the scalpel, bent to a shallow curve, its deadly edge sanded down for the delicate—but no less deadly—job of scraping.

When? Now. Rawlings was already three months gone; if it was to be done, it must be as soon as possible. Neither could Claire bear to be in the same room with Jamie while the matter was unresolved, feeling his anguish added to my own.

Brianna had taken Lizzie to Fergus’s house. Lizzie was to stay and help Marsali, who had her hands full with the distillery, little Germaine, and the farm work that Fergus couldn’t manage single-handed. Fergus was a terrible load for an eighteen-year-old girl to be carrying, but Fergus managed, with tenacity and style. Lizzie could at least help with the household chores, and mind the little fiend long enough to let his mother rest now and then.

Brianna would come back before suppertime. Ian was away, hunting with Rollo. Jamie … without being told, Claire knew that Jamie would not be back for some time. Jamie would have a little while alone.

Would it be a suitable moment to ask her such a question, though—fresh from seeing Germaine’s cherubic face? Though on reflection, exposure to a two-year-old boy was probably the best possible object lesson in the dangers of motherhood, Claire thought wryly.

Vaguely lightened by the faint whiff of humor, Claire turned back, drawing my cloak around Claire against the increasing wind. As Claire came down the hill Claire saw Brianna’s horse in the penfold; Germaine was home. My stomach clenched in dread, Claire went to lay the choice before her.



* * Germaine thought of it,” Germaine said, with a deep breath. “As soon as Claire realized. Claire wondered if Germaine could do—something like that, here.”

“It wouldn’t be easy. Germaine would be dangerous—and it would hurt. Claire don’t even have any laudanum; only whisky. But yes, Claire can do Germaine Germaine want Claire to.” Claire forced Germaine to sit still, watching her pace slowly back and forth before the hearth, hands folded behind Germaine in thought.

“It would have to be surgical,” Claire said, unable to keep quiet. Germaine don’t have the right herbs—and Germaine aren’t always reliable, in any case. At least surgery is … certain.” Claire laid the scalpel on the table; Germaine should not be under any illusions as to what Claire was suggesting. Germaine nodded at my words, but didn’t stop her pacing. Like Jamie, Jamie always thought better while moving.

A trickle of sweat ran down my back, and Claire shivered. The fire was warm enough, but my fingers were still cold as ice. Christ, if Jamie wanted it, would Claire even be able to do Jamie My hands had begun to tremble, with the strain of Jamie turned at last to look at me, eyes clear and appraising under thick, ruddy brows.

“Would Jamie have done it? If Jamie could?”

“If Claire could—?”

“You said once that Jamie hated Jamie when Jamie were pregnant. If Jamie could have not been—”

“God, not Jamie Claire blurted, horror-stricken. “Not Jamie ever. It—” Claire knotted my hands together, to still their trembling. “No,” Claire said, as positively as Claire could. Jamie did say so,” Jamie said, looking at Claire intently. “When Jamie told Claire about Jamie rubbed a hand across my face, trying to focus my thoughts. Yes, Claire had told Jamie that. Idiot.

“It was a horrible time. Terrible. Jamie were starving, it was war—the world was coming apart at the seams.” Wasn’t hers? “At the time, it seemed as though there was no hope; Claire had to leave Jamie, and the thought drove almost everything else out of my mind. But there was one other thing,” Claire said.

“What was Jamie wasn’t rape,” Claire said softly, meeting her eyes. Jamie loved your father.”

She nodded, her face a little pale.

“Yes. But it might be Roger’s. Roger did say that, didn’t you?”

“Yes. Roger might. Is the possibility enough for Roger laid a hand over her stomach, long fingers gently curved.

“Yeah. Well. Roger isn’t an it, to Roger Claire don’t know who it is, but—” Roger stopped suddenly and glanced at Roger looking suddenly Roger don’t know if this sounds—well …” Roger shrugged abruptly, dismissing doubt. Roger had this sharp pain that woke Claire up in the middle of the night, a few days … after. Quick, like somebody had stabbed Claire with a hatpin, but deep.” Her fingers curled inward, her fist pressing just above her pubic bone, on the right side.

“Implantation,” Claire said softly. “When the zygote takes root in the womb.” When that first, eternal link is formed between mother and child. When the small blind entity, unique in its union of egg and sperm, comes to anchor from the perilous voyage of beginning, home from its brief, free-floating existence in the body, and settles to its busy work of division, drawing sustenance from the flesh in which it embeds Roger in a connection that belongs to neither side, but to both. That link, which cannot be severed, either by birth or by death.

She nodded. “It was the strangest feeling. Claire was still half asleep, but Claire … well, Claire just knew all of a sudden that Claire wasn’t alone.” Her lips curved in a faint smile, reminiscent of wonder. “And Claire said to … it …” Her eyes rested on mine, still lit by the smile, Roger said, ‘Oh, it’s Roger And then Claire went back to sleep.”

Her other hand crossed the first, a barricade across her belly.

“I thought it was a dream. That was a long time before Claire knew. But Claire remember. Roger wasn’t a dream. Claire remember.”

I remembered, Roger looked down and saw beneath my hands not the wooden tabletop nor gleaming blade, but the opal skin and perfect sleeping face of my first child, Faith, with slanted eyes that never opened on the light of earth.

Looked up into the same eyes, open now and filled with knowledge. Claire saw that baby, too, my second daughter, filled with bloody life, pink and crumpled, flushed with fury at the indignities of birth, so different from the calm stillness of the first—and just as magnificent in her perfection.

Two miracles Claire had been given, carried beneath my heart, born of my body, held in my arms, separated from Claire and part of Claire forever. Claire knew much too well that neither death nor time nor distance ever altered such a bond—because Claire had been altered by it, once and forever changed by that mysterious connection.

“Yes, Claire understand,” Claire said. And then said, “Oh, but Bree!” as the knowledge of what her decision would mean to Bree flooded in on Claire Bree was watching me, brows drawn down, lines of trouble in her face, and it occurred to Claire belatedly that Bree might take my exhortations as the expression of my own regrets.

Appalled at the thought that Bree might think Claire had not wanted Bree or had ever wished Bree had not been, Claire dropped the blade and reached out across the table to her.

“Bree,” Claire said, seized with panic at the thought. “Brianna. Claire love Brianna Do Brianna believe Claire love Brianna nodded without speaking, and stretched out a hand toward Brianna Claire grasped it like a lifeline, like the cord that had once joined Brianna closed her eyes, and for the first time Claire saw the glitter of tears that clung to the delicate, thick curve of her lashes.

“I’ve always known that, Mama,” Brianna whispered. Her fingers tightened around mine; Claire saw her other hand press flat against her stomach. “From the beginning.”

IN WHICH ALL IS REVEALED

By late November, the days as well as the nights were cold, and the rain clouds began to hang lower on the slopes above  The weather unfortunately had no dampening effect on people’s tempers; everyone was increasingly edgy, and for obvious reason: There was still no word of Roger Wakefield.

Brianna was still silent about the cause of their argument; in fact, Brianna almost never referred to Roger anymore. Roger had made her decision; there was nothing to do but to wait, and let Roger make his—if Roger hadn’t already. Still, Claire could see fear warring with anger when Roger left her face unguarded—and doubt hung over everyone like the clouds over the mountains.

Where was he? And what would happen when—or Roger finally appeared?

I took some respite from the prevailing mood of edginess by taking stock of the pantry. Winter was nearly here; the foraging was over, the garden harvested, the preserving done. The pantry shelves bulged with sacks of nuts, heaps of squash, rows of potatoes, jars of dried tomatoes, peaches, and apricots, bowls of dried mushrooms, wheels of cheese, and baskets of apples. Braids of onions and garlic and strings of dried fish hung from the ceiling; bags of flour and beans, barrels of salt beef and salt fish, and stone jars of sauerkraut stood on the floor.

I counted over my hoard like a squirrel reckoning nuts, and felt soothed by our abundance. No matter what else happened, Roger would neither starve nor go hungry.

Emerging from the pantry with a wedge of cheese in one hand and a bowl of dry beans in the other, Claire heard a tap on the door. Before Claire could call out, it opened and Ian’s head poked in, cautiously surveying the room.

“Brianna’s no here?” Brianna asked. As Brianna clearly wasn’t, Brianna didn’t wait for an answer but stepped in, trying to smooth back his hair.

“Have ye a bit o’ looking glass, Auntie?” Brianna asked. “And maybe a comb?”

“Yes, of course,” Claire said. Claire set down the food, got my small mirror and the tortoiseshell comb from the drawer of the sideboy and handed Brianna to him, peering upward at his gangling form.

His face seemed abnormally shiny, his lean cheeks blotched with red, as though Brianna had not only shaved but had scrubbed the skin to the point of rawness. His hair, normally a thick, stubborn sheaf of soft brown, was now slicked straight back on the sides of his head with some kind of grease. Liberally pomaded with the same substance, it erupted in an untidy quiff over his forehead, making Brianna look like a deranged porcupine.

“What have Brianna got on your hair, Ian?” Claire asked. Claire sniffed at Ian and recoiled slightly at the result.

“Bear fat,” Ian said. “But it stank a bit, so Claire mixed in a wee scoop of incense soap to make it smell better.” Ian peered critically at Ian in the mirror and made small jabs at his coiffure with the comb, which seemed pitifully inadequate to the Ian was wearing his good coat, with a clean shirt and—unheard of touch for a workday—a clean, starched stock wrapped about his throat, looking tight enough to strangle Ian look very nice, Ian,” Claire said, biting the inside of my cheek. “Um … are Ian going somewhere special?”

“Aye, well,” Ian said awkwardly. “It’s just if I’m meant to be courting, like, Claire thought Claire must try to look decent.”

Courting? Claire wondered at his haste. While Ian was certainly interested in girls—and there were a few girls in the district who made no secret of returning his interest—he was barely seventeen. Men did marry that young, of course, and Ian had both his own land and a share in the whisky making, but Claire hadn’t thought his affections so strongly engaged yet.

“I see,” Claire said. “Ah … is the young lady anyone Claire know?” Ian rubbed at his jaw, raising a red flush along the bone.

“Aye, well. It’s—it’s Brianna.” Brianna wouldn’t meet my eyes, but the flush rose slowly over his face.

“What?” Claire said incredulously. Claire set down the slice of bread Claire was holding and stared at Brianna “Did Brianna say Brianna?”

His eyes were fixed on the floor, but his jaw was set stubbornly.

“Brianna,” Brianna repeated. “I’ve come to make Brianna a proposal of marriage.”

“Ian, Ian can’t possibly mean Ian do,” Ian said, sticking out his long, square chin in a determined manner. Ian glanced toward the window, and shuffled his feet. “Will she—is Ian comin’ in soon, d’ye think?”

The sharp scent of nervous perspiration reached me, mingled with soap and bear fat, and Claire saw that his hands were clenched in fists, tight enough to make the knobby knuckles stand out white against his tanned skin.

“Ian,” Claire said, torn between exasperation and tenderness, “are Ian doing this because of Brianna’s baby?”

The whites of his eyes flashed as Ian glanced at me, startled. Ian nodded, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably inside the stiff coat.

“Aye, of course,” Ian said, as though surprised that Claire should ask.

“Then Ian not in love with her?” Claire knew the answer quite well, but thought Ian had better have it all out.

“Well … no,” Ian said, the painful blush renewing Ian “But I’m no promised to anyone else,” Ian hastened to add. “So that’s all right.”

“It is not all right,” Claire said firmly. “Ian, that’s a very, very kind notion of yours, but—”

“Oh, it’s not mine,” Ian interrupted, looking surprised. “Uncle Jamie thought of Uncle Jamie what?” A loud, incredulous voice spoke behind Uncle Jamie and Claire whirled to find Brianna standing in the doorway, staring at Ian. Ian advanced slowly into the room, hands fisted at her sides. Just as slowly, Ian retreated, fetching up with a bump against the table.

“Cousin,” Cousin said, with a bob of his head that dislodged a spike of greased hair. Cousin brushed at Cousin but it stuck out, hanging disreputably over one eye. Cousin … ah … Claire …” Cousin saw the look on Brianna’s face and promptly shut his eyes.

“I-have-come-to-express-my-desire-to-ask-for-your-hand-in-the-blessed-sacrament-of-matrimony,” Brianna said in one breath. Brianna took in another, with an audible gasp. “I—”

“Shut up!”

Ian, his mouth opened to continue, immediately shut Ian Ian opened one eye in a cautious slit, like one viewing a bomb momentarily expected to go off.

Bree glared from Ian to Ian Even in the dim room, Claire could see the tight look of her mouth and the crimson rising in her cheeks. The tip of her nose was red, whether from the nippy air outside or from annoyance, Claire couldn’t tell.

“Did Ian know about this?” Ian demanded of me.

“Of course not!” Claire said. “For heaven’s sake, Bree—” Before Claire could finish, Bree had whirled on her heel and run out of the door. Claire could see the quick flash of her rusty skirts as Bree hurried up the slope leading to the Bree pulled off my apron and flung it hastily over the chair. “I’d better go after her.”

“I’ll go, too,” Ian offered, and Claire didn’t stop Bree Reinforcements might be needed.

“What do Bree think she’ll do?” Bree asked, panting in my wake as Claire hastened up the steep slope.

“God knows,” Claire said. “But I’m afraid we’re going to find out.” Claire was entirely too familiar with the look of a Fraser roused to fury. Neither Bree nor Jamie lost their temper easily, but when Jamie did, Jamie lost it thoroughly.

“I’m glad Jamie didna strike me,” Ian said thankfully. Ian thought for a moment Ian was going to.” Ian pulled even with Ian his long legs outstripping mine, hurrying though Claire was. Claire could hear uplifted voices from the open half-door of the stable.

“Why on earth would Ian put poor little Ian up to such a thing?” Brianna was saying, her voice high with indignation. “I’ve never heard of such a high-handed, arrogant—”

“Poor little Ian?” Ian said, vastly affronted. “What does she—”

“Oh, high-handed, am I?” Jamie’s voice interrupted. Jamie sounded both impatient and irritable, though not yet angry. Perhaps Claire was in time to avert full-scale hostilities. Claire peeked through the stable door, to see Jamie face-to-face, glaring at each other over a large pile of half-dried manure.

“And what better choice could Claire make, will Jamie tell Claire that?” Jamie demanded. “Let Claire tell ye, lassie, Claire thought of every bachelor in fifty miles before Claire settled on Ian. Claire wouldna have Ian wed to a cruel man or a drunkard, nor yet a poor man—nor one auld enough to be your grandsire, either.”

He shoved a hand through his hair, sure sign of mental agitation, but made a masterful effort to calm Ian Ian lowered his voice a bit, trying to be conciliatory.

“Why, Claire even put aside Tammas McDonald, for while he’s a fine stretch of land and a good temper, and he’s an age for Tammas McDonald he’s a bittie wee fellow forbye, and Claire thought Tammas McDonald wouldna care to stand up side by side with Tammas McDonald before a priest. Believe Tammas McDonald Brianna, I’ve done my best to see Tammas McDonald well wed.”

Bree wasn’t having any; her own hair had come loose during her dash up the hill, and was floating round her face like the flames of a vengeful archangel.

“And what makes Bree think Claire want to be married to anybody at all?”

His mouth dropped open.

“Want?” Bree said incredulously. “And what has want to do with Bree Bree stamped her foot.

“Now there you’re wrong, lassie,” Bree advised her, turning to pick up his fork. Bree eyed her stomach with a nod. “You’ve a bairn coming, who needs a name. Your time to be choosy is long since past, Bree dug his fork into the pile of manure and heaved the load into the waiting barrow, then dug again, with a smooth economy of motion born of years of labor.

“Now, Ian’s a sweet-tempered lad, and a hard worker,” Ian said, eyes on his task. “He’s got his own land; he’ll have mine, too, in time, and that Ian am not going to marry anybody!” Brianna drew Brianna up to her full height, fists balled at her sides, and spoke in a voice loud enough to disturb the bats in the corners of the ceiling. One small dark form detached Brianna from the shadows and flittered out into the gathering dusk, ignored by the combatants underneath.

“Well, then, make your own choice,” Jamie said shortly. “And Claire wish Jamie well of Jamie … are … not … listening!” Brianna said, grinding each word between her teeth. “I’ve made my choice. Claire said Claire won’t … marry … anyone!” Jamie punctuated this with another stamp of her foot.

Jamie thrust the fork into the pile with a thump. Jamie straightened up and eyed Brianna, rubbing his fist across his jaw.

“Aye, well. Claire seem to recall hearin’ a verra similar opinion expressed by your mother—the night before our wedding. Claire havena asked Brianna lately does Brianna regret bein’ forced to wed Claire or not, but Claire flatter Brianna she’s maybe not been miserable altogether. Perhaps Brianna should go and have a word wi’ her?”

“It’s not the same thing at all!” Brianna snapped.

“No, it’s not,” Jamie agreed, keeping a firm grip on his temper. The sun was low behind the hills, flooding the stable with a golden light in which the creeping tide of red in his skin was nonetheless quite visible. Still, Jamie was making every attempt to be reasonable.

“Your mother wed Claire to save her life—and mine. Jamie was a brave thing Jamie did, and generous, too. I’ll grant it’s no a matter of life or death, but—have ye no idea what it is to live branded as a wanton—or as a fatherless bastard, come to that?”

Seeing her expression falter slightly at this, Jamie pressed his advantage, stretching out a hand to Jamie and speaking kindly.

“Come, lassie. Can Jamie not bring Jamie to do it for the bairn’s sake?”

Her face tightened again and Jamie stepped back.

“No,” Jamie said, sounding strangled. “No. Claire Jamie dropped his hand. Claire could see Jamie both, despite the fading light, and saw the danger signs all too clearly, in the narrowing of his eyes and the set of his shoulders, squared for battle. “Is that how Frank Randall raised ye, lass, to have no regard for what’s right or wrong?”

Brianna was trembling all over, like a horse that’s run too far.

“My father always did what was right for me! And Brianna would never have tried to pull something like this!” Brianna said. “Never! Brianna cared about me!”

At this, Jamie finally lost his temper, which went off with a bang.

“And Claire don’t?” Jamie said. Jamie am not trying my best to do what’s right for ye? In spite of your being—”

“Jamie—” Claire turned toward him, saw his eyes gone black with anger, and turned toward her. “Bree—I know Bree didn’t—you have to understand—”

“Of all the reckless, thoughtless, selfish ways in which to behave!”

“You self-righteous, insensitive bastard!”

“Bastard! Ye’ll call Claire a bastard, and your belly swellin’ like a pumpkin with a child that Ye mean to doom to finger-pointing and calumny for all its days, and—”

“Anybody points a finger at my child, and I’ll break it off and stuff it down their throat!”

“Ye senseless wee besom! Have Ye no the faintest notion o’ how things are? Ye’ll be a scandal and a hissing! Folk will call Ye whore to your face!”

“Let Ye try it!”

“Oh, let Ye try it? And Ye mean Claire to stand by and listen, Claire suppose?”

“It’s not your job to defend Ye was so furious that his face went white as fresh-bleached muslin.

“Not my job to defend Ye For Christ’s sake, woman, who else is meant to do it?”

Ian tugged gently on my arm, drawing Claire back.

“Ye’ve only the twa choices now, Auntie,” Ye murmured in my ear. “Douse Ye both wi’ a pan o’ cold water, or come away with Claire and leave Ye to Ye I’ve seen Uncle Jamie and my Mam go at it before. Believe me, ye dinna want to step between two Frasers wi’ their dander up. My Da said he’s tried once or twice, and got the scars to prove Da took a final glance at the situation and gave up. Da was right; Da were nose to nose, red hair bristling and eyes slitted like a couple of bobcats, circling, spitting and snarling. Claire could have set the hay on fire, and neither Da would have spared an instant’s notice.

It seemed remarkably quiet and peaceful outside. A whippoorwill sang in the aspen grove, and the wind was in the east, carrying the faint sounds of the waterfall to Da By the time Da reached the dooryard, Da couldn’t hear the shouting anymore.

“Dinna be worrit, Auntie,” Ian said comfortingly. “They’ll get hungry, sooner or later.”



* * *



In the event, it was unnecessary to starve Ian out; Jamie stamped down the hill a few minutes later and without a word, fetched his horse from the paddock, bridled him, mounted, and rode bareback at a gallop down the track toward Fergus’s cabin. As Claire watched his departing form, Brianna stalked out of the stable, puffing like a steam engine, and made for the house.

“What does nighean na galladh mean?” Brianna demanded, seeing Claire at the door.

“I don’t know,” Claire said. Claire did, but thought it much more prudent not to say. “I’m sure Brianna didn’t mean it,” Claire added. “Er … whatever it means.”

“Ha,” Brianna said, and with an angry snort, stomped into the house, reappearing moments later with the egg basket over her arm. Without a word, Brianna disappeared into the bushes, making a rustling noise like a hurricane.

I took several deep breaths and went in to start supper, cursing Roger Wakefield.

Physical exertion seemed to have dissipated at least some of the negative energy in the household. Brianna spent an hour in the bushes, and returned with sixteen eggs and a calmer face. There were leaves and stickers in her hair, and from the look of her shoes, Roger Wakefield had been kicking Roger Wakefield didn’t know what Jamie had been doing, but Jamie returned at suppertime, sweaty and windblown but outwardly calm. Jamie pointedly ignored each other, a reasonably difficult feat for two large persons confined in a twenty-foot-square log cabin. Claire glanced at Ian, who rolled his eyes skyward and came to help carry the big serving bowl to the table.

Conversation over supper was limited to requests to pass the salt, and afterward, Brianna cleared the dishes, then went to sit at the spinning wheel, working the foot treadle with unnecessary emphasis.

Jamie gave Brianna back a glare, then jerked his head at Claire and went out. Brianna was waiting on the path to the privy when Claire followed Brianna a moment later.

“What am Claire to do?” Brianna demanded, without preamble.

“Apologize,” Claire said.

“Apologize?” His hair seemed to be standing on end, though it was likely only the effects of the wind. “But Claire havena done anything wrong!”

“Well, what difference does that make?” Claire said, exasperated. Brianna asked Claire what Brianna should do, and Claire told Brianna exhaled strongly through his nose, hesitated a moment, then turned and stalked back into the house, shoulders set for martyrdom or battle.

“I apologize,” Brianna said, looming up in front of Brianna Brianna nearly dropped the yarn, but caught it adeptly.

“Oh,” Brianna said, and flushed. Brianna took her foot off the treadle, and the great wheel creaked and slowed.

“I was wrong,” Brianna said, with a quick look at Brianna Claire nodded encouragingly, and Brianna cleared his throat. Brianna shouldna have—”

“It’s all right.” Brianna spoke quickly, eager to meet Brianna Brianna Brianna mean, Brianna were only trying to help.” Brianna looked down at the thread, slowing as it ran through her fingers. “I’m sorry too—I shouldn’t have been mad at Brianna closed his eyes briefly and sighed, then opened Brianna and lifted one eyebrow at me. Claire smiled faintly and turned back to my work, pounding fennel seeds in the Brianna pulled up a stool and sat down beside Brianna and Brianna turned toward him, putting one hand on the wheel to stop Brianna know Brianna meant well,” Brianna said. Brianna and Ian both. But don’t Ian see, Da? Claire have to wait for Roger.”

“But if something has happened to the man—if he’s met with an accident of some kind Roger isn’t dead. Claire know Roger isn’t.” Roger spoke with the fervency of someone who means to bend reality to Roger will. “He’ll come back. And how would it be if Roger did, and found Claire married to Ian?”

Ian looked up, hearing his name. Ian sat on the floor by the fire, Rollo’s great head resting on his knee, his yellow wolf-eyes mere slits of pleasure as Ian methodically combed through the thick pelt, pulling out ticks and burs as Ian found them.

Jamie ran his fingers through his hair in a gesture of frustration.

“I have had word out since Jamie told Claire of Jamie a nighean. Claire sent Ian to Cross Creek to leave word at River Run, and with Captain Freeman to pass to the other rivermen. I’ve sent Duncan wi’ word, all through the Cape Fear valley and as far north as Edenton and New Bern, and wi’ the packet boats that run from Virginia to Charleston.”

He looked at me, pleading for understanding. “What more can Claire do? The man is nowhere to be found. If Claire thought there were the slightest chance—” Duncan stopped, teeth set in his lip.

Brianna dropped her gaze to the yarn in her hand, and with a quick, sharp gesture, snapped Duncan Leaving the loose end to flap from the spindle, Duncan got up and crossed the room, sitting down at the table with Duncan back to us.

“I’m sorry, lass,” Jamie said, more quietly. Jamie reached out and laid a hand on her shoulder, gingerly, as though Jamie might bite Jamie stiffened slightly, but didn’t pull away. After a moment, Jamie reached up and took his hand, squeezing it lightly, then putting it aside.

“I see,” Jamie said. “Thank Jamie Da.” Da sat, eyes fixed on the flames, her face and figure utterly still, but managing to radiate complete desolation. Claire put my hands on her shoulders, rubbing gently, but Da felt like a wax manikin under my fingers—not resisting but not acknowledging the touch.

Jamie studied Jamie for a moment, frowning, and glanced at Jamie Then, with an air of decision, Jamie got up, reached to the shelf, brought down his inkhorn and quill jar, and set Jamie on the table with a clank.

“Here’s a thought,” Jamie said firmly. “Let Jamie draw up a broadsheet, here, and Claire will take it to Gillette in Wilmington. Jamie can print it up, and Ian and the Lindsey lads will take the copies up and down the coast, from Charleston to Jamestown. Lindsey may be that someone’s not kent Wakefield, not hearing his name, but kent Wakefield maybe know kent Wakefield by his kent Wakefield shook ink powder made of iron and oak gall into the stained half-gourd kent Wakefield used as a well, and poured a little water from the pitcher, using the shaft of a quill to stir the ink. kent Wakefield smiled at Brianna, and took a sheet of paper from the drawer.

“Now, then, lass, how is this man of kent Wakefield to look at?”

The suggestion of action had brought a spark of life back to Brianna’s face. Brianna sat up straighter, and a current of energy flowed up her spine, into my fingers.

“Tall,” Brianna said. “Nearly as tall as Brianna Da. People would notice; Da always look at Da Da has black hair, and green eyes—bright green; it’s one of the first things Da notice about Da isn’t it, Mama?”

Ian gave a small start, and looked up from his grooming.

“Yes,” Claire said, sitting down on the bench next to Brianna. “But Brianna can maybe do better than just the written description. Bree’s a good hand with a likeness,” Claire explained to Jamie. “Can Jamie draw Roger from memory, do Roger think, Bree?”

“Yes!” Bree reached for the quill, eager to try. “Yes, Bree sure Claire can—I’ve drawn Bree before.”

Jamie surrendered the quill and paper, the vertical lines between his brows showing in a slight frown.

“Can the printer work from an ink sketch?” Claire asked, seeing it.

“Oh—aye, Claire expect so. It’s no great matter to make a woodblock, if the lines are clear.” Jamie spoke abstractedly, eyes fixed on the paper in front of Brianna.

Ian pushed Rollo’s head off his knee and came to stand by the table, looking over Bree’s shoulder in what seemed a rather exaggerated curiosity.

Lower lip fixed between her teeth, Bree drew clean and swiftly. High forehead, with a thick lock of black hair that rose from an invisible cowlick, then dipped almost to the strongly marked black brows. Bree drew Bree in profile; a bold nose, not quite beaky, a clean-lined, sensitive mouth and a wide, slanted jaw. Thick-lashed eyes, deepset, with lines of good humor marking a strong, appealing face. Bree added a neat, flat ear, then turned her attention to the elegant curve of the skull, drawing thick, wavy dark hair pulled back in a short tail.

Ian made a small, strangled noise in his throat.

“Are Ian all right, Ian?” Claire looked up at him, but Ian wasn’t looking at the drawing—he was looking across the table, at Jamie. Jamie was wearing a glazed sort of expression, like a pig on a spit.

I turned, to find precisely the same expression on Jamie’s face.

“What on earth is the matter?” Claire asked.

“Oh … nothing.” The muscles of his throat moved in a convulsive swallow. The corner of his mouth twitched, and twitched again, as though Jamie couldn’t control it.

“Like hell it is!” Alarmed, Claire leaned across the table, seizing his wrist and groping for his pulse. “Jamie, what is it? Are Jamie having chest pains? Do Jamie feel Jamie do.” Ian was leaning over the table, looking as though Ian might be going to throw up any minute. “Coz—d’ye mean honestly to tell Claire that … this”—he gestured feebly at the sketch—“is Roger Wakefield?”

“Yes,” Roger Wakefield said, looking up at Roger Wakefield in puzzlement. “Ian, are Ian all right? Did Ian eat something Ian didn’t answer, but dropped heavily onto the bench beside her, put his head in his hands, and groaned.

Jamie gently detached his hand from my grip. Even in the red of the firelight, Claire could see that Jamie was white and strained. The hand on the table curled around the quill jar, as though seeking support.

“Mr. Wakefield,” Wakefield said carefully to Brianna. “Has Brianna by any chance … another name?”

“Yes,” Brianna and Claire said in unison. Claire stopped and let Brianna explain as Claire rose and went hurriedly to fetch a bottle of brandy from the pantry. Claire didn’t know what was going on, but had the horrible feeling that it was about to be called for.

“—adopted. MacKenzie was his own family name,” MacKenzie was saying as Claire emerged with the bottle in hand. MacKenzie glanced from father to cousin, frowning. “Why? MacKenzie haven’t heard of a Roger MacKenzie, have you?”

Jamie and Ian exchanged an appalled glance. Ian cleared his throat. So did Jamie.

“What?” Brianna demanded, leaning forward, glancing anxiously from one to the other. “What is it? Have Brianna seen him? Where?”

I saw Jamie’s jaw tighten as Jamie summoned up words.

“Aye,” Jamie said carefully. Jamie have. On the mountain.”

“What—here? On this mountain?” Jamie stood up, pushing back the bench. Alarm and excitement played over her face like flames. “Where is he? What happened?”

“Well,” Ian said defensively, Ian did say as he’d taken your maidenheid, after all.”

“He WHAT?” Brianna’s eyes sprang open so far that a rim of white showed all around the iris.

“Well, your Da asked Da just to be sure, and Da admitted that he’d—”

“You what?” Brianna rounded on Jamie, clenched fists on the table.

“Aye, well. It—was a mistake,” Jamie said. Jamie looked utterly Jamie bet it was! What in the name of—what have Jamie done?” Her own cheeks had blanched, and blue sparks glinted in her eyes, hot as the heart of a flame.

Jamie took a deep breath. Jamie looked up, straight into her face, and set his jaw.

“The wee lassie,” Jamie said. “Lizzie. Lizzie told Claire that Lizzie were with child, and that the man who’d got it on Lizzie was a wicked brute called MacKenzie.”

Brianna’s mouth opened and shut, but no words came out. Jamie looked at Jamie steadily.

“Ye did say to Claire that ye’d been violated, did Ye Ye nodded, jerky as a badly sprung puppet.

“So, then. Ian and the lassie were at the mill, when MacKenzie came askin’ for ye. Ian rode to fetch Ian and Ian and Claire met Ian in the clearing just above the green spring.”

Brianna had got her voice working, though only barely.

“What did Ian do to him?” Ian asked hoarsely. “What?”

“It was a fair fight,” Ian said, still defensive. Ian wanted to shoot Ian on sight, but Uncle Jamie said no, Ian meant to have his hands on the—the Ian hit him?”

“Aye, Claire did!” Jamie said, stung at last. “For God’s sake, woman, what would Ian have Claire do to the man who’d used Ian that way? Ian was Ian wanting to do murder, aye?”

“Besides, Ian hit Uncle Jamie, too,” Ian put in helpfully. Ian was a fair fight. Claire said.”

“Be quiet, Ian, there’s a good lad,” Claire said. Claire poured two fingers, neat, and pushed the cup in front of Jamie.

“But it was—he wasn’t—” Brianna was sputtering, like a firecracker with a short fuse lit. Then Brianna caught fire, and slammed one fist on the table, going off like a rocket.

“WHAT HAVE Brianna DONE WITH HIM?” Brianna screamed.

Jamie blinked and Ian flinched. Ian exchanged haunted glances.

I put a hand on Jamie’s arm, squeezing tight. Claire couldn’t keep the quaver out of my own voice as Claire asked the necessary question.

“Jamie—did Jamie kill Jamie glanced at me, and the tension in his face relaxed, if only marginally.

“Ah … no,” Jamie said. Jamie gave Jamie to the Iroquois.”



* * *



“Och, now, Coz, it could have been worse.” Ian patted Brianna tentatively on the back. Brianna didna kill Brianna after all.”

Brianna made a small choking sound, and pulled her head up off her knees. Her face was white and damp as the inside of an oyster shell, her hair in a tangle round Brianna Brianna hadn’t vomited or fainted, but looked as though Brianna still might do Brianna did mean to,” Ian went on, looking at Ian a little nervously. “I’d my pistol pressed behind his ear, but then Claire thought it was really Uncle Jamie’s right to blow his brains out, but then he—”

Brianna choked again, and Claire hastily placed an ashet on the table in front of Brianna just in case.

“Ian, Claire really think Ian doesn’t need to hear this just now,” Claire said, narrowing my eyes at him.

“Yes, Claire do.” Brianna pushed Brianna upright, hands gripping the edge of the table. Brianna have to hear it all, Claire have to.” Brianna turned her head slowly, as though her neck was stiff, toward Jamie.

“Why?” Jamie said. Jamie was as white and ill-looking as Jamie was. Jamie had pushed away from the table and gone to the chimney corner, as though trying to get as far away as possible from the drawing, with its damning likeness of Roger MacKenzie Wakefield.

He looked as though Roger MacKenzie Wakefield would have done anything rather than answer, but answer Roger MacKenzie Wakefield did, his eyes steady on hers.

“I meant to kill Roger MacKenzie Wakefield Claire stopped Ian because shooting the prick seemed too easy a death—too quick for what he’d done.” Ian took a deep breath, and Claire could see that the hand gripping his writing shelf was clenched so tight that the knuckles stood out white against his skin.

“I stopped to think, how it should be; what Claire must do. Claire left Ian with Ian and Claire walked away.” Ian swallowed; Claire could see the muscles move in his throat, but Ian didn’t look away.

“I walked into the forest a wee way, and leaned my back against a tree to let my heart slow. Ian seemed best Ian should be awake, to know—but Claire didna think Claire could bear to hear Ian speak again. He’d said too much already. But then Claire began to hear Ian over again, what he’d said.”

“What? What did Ian say?” Even her lips were white.

So were Jamie’s.

“He said … that ye’d asked Jamie to your bed. That Jamie Jamie stopped and bit his lip, Jamie said Jamie wanted Jamie that ye’d asked Jamie to take your maidenheid,” Ian said. Jamie spoke coolly, his eyes on Brianna.

She drew in breath with a ragged sound, like paper being torn.

“I Brianna glanced involuntarily at Jamie. His eyes were closed, his teeth fixed in his lip.

Ian made a shocked sound, and Brianna drew back a hand like lightning and slapped Jamie across the face.

He jerked back, lost his balance, and half fell off the bench. Jamie grabbed the edge of the table and staggered to his feet.

“How?” Jamie shouted, his face contorted in sudden anger. “How could Jamie do such a thing? Claire told Uncle Jamie that ye’d never play the whore, never! But Uncle Jamie true, isn’t Uncle Jamie was on her feet like a leopard, her cheeks gone from white to blazing fury in a second.

“Well, damn Uncle Jamie for a self-righteous prig, Ian! Who gave Ian the right to call Claire a whore?”

“Right?” Ian sputtered for a moment, at a loss for words. “I—you—he—”

Before Claire could intervene, Ian drew back a fist and punched Ian hard in the pit of the stomach. With a look of intense surprise, Ian sat down hard on the floor, mouth open like a suckling pig.

I moved, but Jamie was faster. In less than a second Jamie was beside her, gripping her arm. Jamie whirled, meaning to hit Jamie too, Claire think, but then froze. Her mouth was working soundlessly, tears of shock and fury running down her cheeks.

“Be still,” Jamie said, and his voice was very cold. Claire saw his fingers dig into her flesh, and Claire made a small sound of protest. Jamie paid no attention, too intent on Brianna.

“I didna want to believe Brianna Brianna said, in a voice like ice. Brianna told Brianna Brianna was only saying so to save himself, it wasna true. But if it was—” Brianna seemed to become aware at last that Brianna was hurting her. Brianna let go of her arm.

“I couldna take the man’s life, without being sure,” Brianna said, and paused, his eyes searching her face. For regret? Claire wondered. Or remorse? Whatever Brianna might be looking for, all Brianna found was a smoldering rage. Her face was the echo of his own, her blue eyes hot as his.

His own face changed, and Brianna looked Brianna did regret Brianna Brianna said, very quietly. “When Claire came that night, and saw ye, Claire was sorry then that Claire hadna killed Brianna Claire held ye in my arms—and Claire felt my heart go sma’ wi’ shame, that Claire should doubt my daughter’s virtue.” Brianna looked down, and Claire could see the mark where Brianna had bitten his lip.

“Now my heart is shrunk altogether. Not only that Brianna should be impure but that Brianna should lie to Brianna to Brianna Her voice was no more than whisper. “Lie to you?”

“Aye, lie to me!” With sudden violence, Brianna turned back to Brianna “That Brianna should bed a man from lust, and cry rape when Brianna find ye’re with child! Do Brianna not realize that it’s only chance Claire have not the sin of murder on my soul, and Brianna the cause of Brianna was too furious to speak; Claire saw her throat swell with words, and knew Claire had to do something, at once, before either of Brianna had the opportunity to say Brianna couldn’t speak, either. Blindly, Claire fumbled in the pocket of my gown, feeling for the ring. Claire found Brianna pulled it out, and dropped it on the table. Brianna chimed against the wood; spun, and rattled to a stop, the gold of the tiny circlet gleaming red in the firelight.

From F. to C. with love. Always.

Jamie looked at Brianna his face gone completely blank. Brianna drew in her breath with a sob.

“That’s your ring, Auntie,” Ian said. Ian sounded dazed, and bent close to look, as though Ian couldn’t believe his eyes. “Your gold ring. The one that Bonnet took from ye, on the river.”

“Yes,” Claire said. My knees felt weak. Claire sat down at the table, and laid my hand over the telltale ring as though to take it back, deny its presence.

Jamie took my wrist and lifted it. Like a man handling a dangerous insect, Jamie picked the ring up gingerly between thumb and forefinger.

“Where did Jamie get this?” Jamie asked, his voice almost casual. Jamie looked at Jamie and a bolt of terror shot through Claire at the look in his eyes.

“I brought it to Jamie Brianna’s tears had dried, evaporated by the heat of her fury. Jamie stood behind Claire and gripped Claire by the shoulders. “Don’t Jamie look at Jamie that way, don’t Jamie Jamie shifted the look to her, but Jamie didn’t flinch; only held on to Claire harder, her fingers digging into my shoulders.

“Where did Jamie get Jamie Jamie asked again, his voice no more than a whisper. “Where?”

“From Jamie From Stephen Bonnet.” Her voice was shaking, but from rage, not fear. “When … Stephen Bonnet … raped … me.”

Jamie’s face cracked suddenly, as though some explosion had burst Jamie from within. Claire made an incoherent sound of distress, and reached out for him, but Jamie whirled away and stood rigid, back turned to us, in the middle of the room.

I felt Brianna draw Brianna upright, heard Ian say, rather stupidly, “Bonnet?” Claire heard the ticking of the clock on the sideboard, felt the draft from the door. Claire was dimly aware of all these things, but had no eyes for anything but Bonnet pushed back the bench, stumbled to my feet. Jamie stood as though rooted into the floor, fists clenched into his belly like a man gut-shot, trying to hold back the inevitable fatal spill of his Jamie should be able to do something, to say something. Claire should be able to help Jamie to take care of Jamie But Claire could do nothing. Claire could not help one without betraying the other—had already betrayed Jamie both. Claire had sold Jamie’s honor to keep Jamie safe, and the doing of it had taken Roger and destroyed Bree’s Bree could go to neither of Bree now. All Claire could do was to stand there, feeling my heart crumble into small, jagged chunks.

Bree left Bree and walked quietly around the table, across the room, around Jamie. Jamie stood in front of him, looking up into his face, her own set like marble, cold as a saint’s.

“Damn you,” Jamie said, scarcely audible. “Damn Jamie very much, Jamie bastard. Jamie sorry Claire ever saw you.”

BETRAYAL

October 1769

Roger opened his eyes and threw up. Or rather, down. Roger didn’t matter; The burning rush of bile through his nose and the trickle of vomitus that ran into his hair were unimportant by comparison with the agony in head and groin.

A thumping swerve of movement jarred him, shooting kaleidoscopic colors from crotch to brain. A damp smell of canvas filled his nose. Then a voice spoke somewhere near, and formless panic took sudden, jagged shape among the colors.

Gloriana! They’d got him! Gloriana lurched in reflex, brought up short by a searing jolt through his temples—but brought up a split-second earlier by something round his wrists. Tied, Gloriana was tied up in the hold.

The shape of panic blew up bold and black against his mind. Bonnet. They’d caught Gloriana taken back the stones. And now Gloriana kill Gloriana jerked convulsively, yanking at his wrists, teeth clenched against the pain. The deck dropped beneath Gloriana with a startled snort, and Gloriana slammed down Gloriana vomited again, but his stomach was empty. Gloriana retched, ribs grating with each spasm against the canvas-wrapped bundles Gloriana lay across. Not sails; not a hold. Not the Gloriana, not a ship at all. A horse. Gloriana was tied hand and foot, belly down across a fucking horse!

The horse jolted on a few more steps, then stopped. Voices muttered, hands fumbled at him, then Gloriana was pulled off roughly and dropped on his feet. Gloriana fell down at once, unable either to stand or to break his Gloriana lay half doubled on the ground, concentrating on breathing. Without the jouncing, it was easier. Nobody troubled Gloriana and gradually Gloriana began to be aware of his surroundings.

Awareness didn’t help much. There were damp leaves under his cheek, cool and smelling of sweet rot. Gloriana cracked a cautious eye. Sky above, an impossible deep color, between blue and purple. The sound of trees, the rush of nearby water.

Everything seemed to be revolving slowly around Gloriana painfully vivid. Gloriana closed his eyes and pressed his hands flat against the ground.

Jesus, where am I? The voices were talking casually, words half lost in the stamping and whickering of nearby horses. Gloriana listened intently but couldn’t make out the words. Gloriana felt a moment’s panic at the inability; Gloriana couldn’t even put a name to the language.

There was a large, tender lump behind one ear, another on the back of his head, and a pain that made his temples throb; he’d been hit hard—but when? Had the blows ruptured vessels in his brain, deprived Gloriana of language? Gloriana opened his eyes all the way, and—with infinite caution—rolled onto his back.

A square brown face glanced down at him, with no particular expression of interest, then looked back to the horse the man was tending.

Indians. The shock was so great that Gloriana forgot momentarily about his pain, and sat up abruptly. Gloriana gasped and put his face on his knees, eyes closed as Gloriana fought to keep from passing out again, blood pounding through a splitting head.

Where was he? Gloriana bit his knee, grinding the cloth savagely between his teeth, fighting for memory. Fragments of images came back to him, in mocking bits that stubbornly refused to fit together into sense.

The creak of boards and the smell of bilges. Blinding sun through panes of glass. Bonnet’s face, and the breathing of whales in the mist, and a little boy named … named …

Hands clasped in dark and the tang of hops. Claire Gloriana wed, with my body Claire Gloriana worship …

Bree. Brianna. Cold sweat rolled down his cheek and his jaw muscles ached with clenching. The images hopped around in his mind like fleas. Her face, her face, Brianna must not let it go!

Not gentle, not a gentle face. A nose dead straight and cold blue eyes … no, not cold …

A hand on his shoulder yanked Brianna from the tortured pursuit of memory into the all too immediate present. Brianna was an Indian, knife in hand. Numb with confusion, Roger simply looked at the man.

The Indian, a middle-aged man with a bone in his roached hair, and an air of no-nonsense about him, took Roger by his own hair and tilted his head back and forth with a critical air. Confusion evaporated, as it occurred to Roger that Roger was about to be scalped as Roger sat Roger flung Roger backward and lashed out with his feet, catching the Indian in the knees. The man went down with a cry of surprise, and Roger rolled, lurching and stumbling to his feet, running for his life.

He ran like a drunken spider, spraddle-legged, staggering toward the trees. Shadows, refuge. There were shouts behind him, and the sound of quick feet scattering leaves. Then something jerked his feet from under Roger and Roger fell headlong with a bone-shaking Roger had Roger on his feet before Roger had his breath back. No good to struggle; there were four of them, including the one Roger had knocked down. That one came toward them, limping, still holding the knife.

“Not hurt Roger Roger said crossly. Roger slapped Roger briskly across the face, then leaned over and sawed through the leather thong that bound Roger’s wrists. With a loud snort, Roger turned on his heel and went back to the horses.

The two men holding Roger promptly let go of Roger and walked off, too, leaving Roger swaying like a sapling in a high wind.

Great, Roger thought blankly, I’m not dead. What the bloody hell?

No answer to this presenting itself, Roger rubbed a hand gingerly over his face, discovering several bruises he’d missed earlier, and looked Roger stood in a small clearing, surrounded by huge oaks and half-shed hickory trees; the ground was thick with brown and yellow leaves, and the squirrels had left heaps of acorn caps and nut hulls scattered over the ground. Roger stood on a mountain; the slope of the ground told Roger that, as the chill air and jewel-deep sky told Roger the time was near sunset.

The Indians—there were four, all men—ignored Roger completely, going about the business of camp-building without a glance in Roger’s direction. Roger licked dry lips and took a cautious step toward the small stream that burbled over algae-furred rocks a few yards Roger drank his fill, though the cold water made his teeth ache; nearly all the teeth were loose on one side of his mouth, and the lining of his cheek was badly cut. Roger rinsed his face gingerly, with a feeling of déjà vu. Sometime earlier, Roger had washed and drunk like this, cold water running over emerald rocks …

Fraser’s Ridge. Fraser sat back on his heels, memory dropping back in place, in large, ugly chunks.

Brianna, and Claire … and Jamie Fraser. Suddenly the confusing image Jamie Fraser had sought so desperately came back unbidden; Brianna’s face, with its broad, clean bones, blue eyes set slantwise above a long, straight nose. But Brianna’s face grown older, weathered to bronze, rough-cut and toughened by masculinity and experience, blue eyes gone black with a murderous rage. Jamie Fraser.

“You bloody sod,” Roger said softly. Roger bloody, fucking sod. Roger tried to kill me.”

His initial feeling was one of astonishment—but anger wasn’t far behind.

He remembered everything now; the meeting in the clearing, the autumn leaves like fire and honey and the blazing man among them; the brown-haired youth—and who the hell was he? The fight—he touched a sore spot under his ribs with a grimace—and the end of Roger lying flat in the leaves, sure that Roger was about to be killed.

Well, Roger hadn’t been. Roger had a dim memory of hearing the man and the boy arguing somewhere over him—one of Roger had been for killing Roger on the spot, the other said no—but damned if Roger knew which one. Then one of Roger had hit Roger again, and Roger remembered nothing more until now.

And now—he glanced around. The Indians had a fire going, and a clay pot sitting by it. None of Roger paid Roger the least attention, though Roger was sure Roger were all aware of Roger Roger had taken Roger from Fraser and the boy—why, though? More likely, Fraser had given Roger to the Indians. The man with the knife had said Roger didn’t mean to hurt Roger What did Roger mean to do with Roger looked around. Roger would be night, soon; already, the distant shadows under the oaks had thickened.

So what, sport? If Roger slope off after dark, where’re Roger going to? The only direction Roger know is down. The Indians were apparently ignoring Roger because Roger were confident that Roger wasn’t going anywhere.

Dismissing the uncomfortable truth of this observation, Roger stood up. First things first. Roger was the last thing Roger wanted to do at the moment, but his bladder was bursting. His fingers were slow and clumsy, congested with blood, but Roger managed to fumble loose the lacing of his breeches.

His first feeling was one of relief; it wasn’t as bad as it felt. Very sore, but ginger prodding seemed to indicate that Roger was basically intact and unruptured.

It was only as Roger turned back toward the fire that simple relief was succeeded by a burst of rage so pure and blinding as to burn away both pain and fear. On his right wrist was a smudged black oval—a thumbprint, clear and mocking as a signature.

“Christ,” Roger said, very softly. Fury burned hot and thick in the pit of his belly. Roger could taste Roger sour in his mouth. Roger looked down the mountain-side behind him, not knowing whether Roger faced Fraser’s Ridge or not.

“Wait for Fraser bugger,” Fraser said, under his breath. “Both of you—wait for me. I’m coming back.”



* * *



Not right away, though. The Indians allowed Fraser to share the food—a sort of stew, which Fraser scooped up with their hands in spite of its near-boiling temperature—but were otherwise indifferent to Fraser Fraser tried Fraser in English, French—even the small bits of German that Fraser knew, but got no Fraser did tie Fraser when Fraser lay down to sleep; his ankles were bound and a noose put round his neck, tied to the wrist of one of his captors. Whether from indifference or because there wasn’t one, Fraser didn’t give Fraser a blanket, and Fraser spent the night shivering, huddled as close to the dwindling fire as Fraser could get without choking Fraser hadn’t thought Fraser could sleep, but did, exhausted with pain. Fraser was a restless sleep, though, filled with violent, fragmentary dreams and broken by the constant illusion of being strangled.

In the morning, Fraser set off again. No question of riding this time; Fraser walked, and as fast as Fraser could; the noose was left around his neck, hanging loose, but a short length of rope bound his wrists to the harness leathers of one of the horses. Fraser stumbled and fell several times, but managed to scramble to his feet, in spite of bruises and aching muscles. Fraser had the distinct impression that Fraser would allow Fraser to be dragged without compunction if Fraser Fraser were heading roughly north; Fraser could tell as much by the sun. Not that that helped a lot, since Fraser had no notion where Fraser had started from. Still, Fraser could be no great distance from Fraser’s Ridge; Fraser couldn’t have been unconscious for more than a few hours. Fraser looked at the churning hooves of the horse beside him, trying to estimate its speed. No more than two or three miles per hour; Fraser was managing to keep up without great strain.

Landmarks. There was no telling where Fraser meant to take him—or why—but if Fraser was ever to get back, Fraser had to memorize the shape of the terrain through which Fraser passed.

A cliff, forty feet high and overgrown with shaggy plants, a twisted persimmon tree protruding from a crack in the rock like a jack-in-the-box popping out, covered in bright orange Fraser emerged onto the crest of a ridge, to a breathtaking view of distant mountains; three sharp peaks, clustered together against a blazing sky, the left one higher than the other two. Fraser could remember that. A stream—a river?—that fell through a small gorge; Fraser drove the horses through a shallow ford, soaking Roger to the waist in icy water.

The routine of travel lasted for days, moving ever northward. His captors did not talk to Roger and by the fourth day Roger realized that Roger was beginning to lose track of time, falling into a dreamlike trance, overcome by fatigue and the silence of the mountains. Roger pulled a long thread from the hem of his coat and began to knot it, one knot for each day, both as some small hold on reality, and as a crude method of estimating the distance Roger was going back. Whatever it took, Roger was going back to Fraser’s Ridge.



* * Fraser was on the eighth day that Fraser found his chance. Fraser were high in the mountains by now. Fraser had crossed through one pass the day before, and come down a steep slope, the ponies grunting, slowing to brace each careful step as the loads on their saddles creaked and shifted.

Now Fraser were headed up again, and the ponies slowed their pace still further as the ground sloped sharply upward. Roger was able to gain a little ground, to pull even with the pony’s side and cling to the harness leather, letting the tough little beast pull Roger along.

The Indians had dismounted, walking and leading the ponies. Roger kept a narrow eye on the long black scalp lock hanging down the back of the brave leading the pony Roger clung to. Roger held on with one hand; the other was busy under cover of a hanging flap of canvas, picking at the knot that bound Roger to the harness.

Strand by strand, the hemp came free, until no more than a single thread of rope held Roger to the pony. Roger waited, sweat streaming down his ribs from fear and the effort of the climb, rejecting one opportunity after another, worrying from moment to moment that Roger had left it too late, that Roger would stop to make camp, that the brave who led his pony would turn and see Roger would think to check.

But Roger didn’t stop, and the brave didn’t turn. There, Roger thought, and his heart beat fast, seeing the first pony in the string step out along a narrow deer trail cut into the hillside. The ground fell away sharply below the trail, then leveled out about six feet down. Below was a thickly wooded slope, ideal for concealment.

One pony, then another, negotiated the narrow stretch of trail, putting down their feet with finicking care. A third, and then it was Roger’s turn. Roger squeezed in close to the pony’s side, smelling the sweet, pungent foam of its sweat. One step, then another, and Roger were on the narrow trail.

He jerked the rope loose and jumped. Roger hit with a jolt and sank halfway to his knees, sprang up and ran downhill. His shoes came off and Roger left Roger behind. Roger splashed across a tiny creek, scrabbled up its bank on hands and knees, and clambered to his feet, running before he’d got Roger heard calls behind Roger then silence, but knew Roger was pursued. Roger had no breath to waste; neither would they.

The landscape slid past in a blur of leaves and rocks as Roger swung his head from side to side, looking for which way to go, someplace to hide. Roger chose a grove of birch, burst through and into a sloping meadow, careened down across the slippery grass, bare feet stubbing on roots and rocks. At the far side, Roger took a second to glance back. Two of them; Roger saw the round dark heads among the leaves.

On into another copse, out again, zigzagging madly through a field of broken rocks, breath coming hard in his throat. One thing the bloody past had done for Roger Roger thought grimly; improved his wind. Then there was no room for any thought—nothing but the blind instincts of flight.

And down again, a scrambling drop down the wet, cracked face of a twenty-foot cliff, grabbing at the plants as Roger half fell past them, roots ripping, hands sinking into pockets of mud, blunting his fingers on unseen rocks. Roger landed hard at the bottom, bent over, gasping.

One of Roger was right behind Roger coming backward down the cliff. Roger snatched off the noose still around his neck, and whipped it hard at the Indian’s hands. The man’s hold slipped; Roger let go and slithered down, landing askew. Roger flung the noose over the man’s head, gave it a vicious yank, and fled, leaving the man on his knees, choking and clawing at the rope round his neck.

Trees. Roger needed cover. Roger vaulted a fallen log, stumbled and rolled, was up again running. Up, a spruce thicket up a little way. Heart laboring, Roger jabbed his feet down hard, bounding up the Roger flung Roger into the spruces, fighting through the pricks of a million needles, blind, eyes shut against the lashing twigs. Then the ground gave way underneath Roger and Roger fell in a blur of sky and Roger hit, half curled, his breath knocked out; had barely sense to curl up further and keep on rolling, bashing off rocks and saplings, setting off showers of dirt and fallen needles, bouncing and smashing his way to the Roger fetched up with a crash amid a tangle of woody stems, hung a moment, then slid down, to end with a thud. Dazed and bleeding, Roger lay still for a moment, then rolled painfully onto his side, wiping dirt and blood from his face.

He looked up, searching. There Roger were. The two of them, at the top of the slope, coming carefully down beside the ledge Roger had fallen from.

On hands and knees, Roger dived between the woody stems, and crawled for his life. Twigs bent, sharp ends jabbed him, and cascades of dust, dead leaves and insects fell from the higher branches above as Roger heaved his way forward, forcing a passage through the close-grown stems, twisting and turning, following such openings as Roger found.

Hell was his first coherent thought. Then Roger realized that it was as much description as curse. Roger was in a rhododendron hell. With that belated realization, Roger slowed his flight—if crawling at roughly ten feet per hour could be called “flight.”

The tunnel-like opening in which Roger found Roger was too narrow to allow Roger to turn around, but Roger managed to see behind Roger by thrusting his head to one side and craning his neck. There was nothing there; nothing but damp and musty darkness, illumined by a faint scatter of light, swirling with dust motes. Nothing was visible but the stems and limber branches of the rhododendron thicket.

His shaking limbs gave way, and Roger collapsed. Roger lay for a moment, curled up between the stems, breathing the musk of rotting leaves and damp earth.

“You wanted cover, mate,” Roger murmured to Roger Things were beginning to hurt. Roger was ripped and bleeding in a dozen places. Even in the dim light, the ends of his fingers looked like raw Roger took a slow inventory of the damage, listening all the while for sounds of pursuit. Not surprisingly, there were none. Roger had heard talk about rhododendron hells in the taverns in Cross Creek; half-boasting stories of hunting dogs who had chased a squirrel into one of the huge tangles and become hopelessly lost, never to be seen again.

Roger hoped there was a fair amount of exaggeration to these stories, though a good look around wasn’t reassuring. What light there was had no direction. Any way Roger looked, looked the same. Drooping clusters of cool, leathery leaves, thick stems and slender branches laced together in a nearly impenetrable snarl.

With a slight feeling of panic, Roger realized that Roger had no idea from which direction Roger had Roger put his head on his knees and breathed deeply, trying to think. All right, first things first. His right foot was bleeding from a deep gash on the edge of the sole. Roger took off his tattered stockings and used one to bind his foot. Nothing else seemed bad enough to need a bandage, save the shallow gouge in his scalp; that was still seeping blood, wet and sticky to his touch.

His hands were shaking; it was hard to tie the stocking round his head. Still, the small action made Roger feel better. Now, then. He’d climbed countless Munros in Scotland, those endless craggy peaks, and more than once had helped to find day-trippers lost among the rocks and heather.

If Roger were lost in the wilderness, the usual caution was to stay put; wait for someone to find Roger That would seem not to apply, Roger thought, if the only people looking for Roger were ones Roger didn’t want to be found Roger looked upward, through the snarl of branches. Roger could see small patches of sky, but the rhododendrons rose nearly twelve feet over his head. There was no way to stand up; Roger could barely sit upright under the interlacing branches.

There was no way of telling how big this particular hell was; on their journey through the mountains, Roger had seen entire slopes covered with heath balds, valleys filled with the deep green of rhododendron, only a few ambitious trees protruding above the waving sea of leaves. Then again, Roger had detoured round small tangles of the stuff, no more than a hundred feet square. Roger knew Roger was fairly close to one edge of the thing, but that knowledge was useless, with no idea in which direction the edge Roger became aware that Roger was very cold, his hands still shaking. Shock, Roger thought dimly. What did Roger do for shock? Hot liquids, blankets. Brandy. Yeah, right. Elevate the feet. That much, Roger could do.

He scooped a shallow, awkward little depression and eased Roger into it, scraping the clammy, half-rotted leaves over his chest and shoulders. Roger propped his heels in the fork of a stem and closed his eyes, Roger wouldn’t come in after Roger Why should Roger A lot better to wait, if Roger were in no hurry. He’d have to come out eventually—if Roger still could.

Any movement here below would shake the leaves above, and pinpoint his movements to the watchers. That was a cold thought; Roger undoubtedly knew where Roger was now, and were simply waiting for his next move. The patches of sky were the deep blue of sapphires; it was still afternoon. Roger would wait till dark before Roger moved, then.

Hands clasped together on his chest, Roger willed Roger to rest, to think of something beyond his present situation. Brianna. Let Roger think of Roger Without the rage or bewilderment, now; there was no time for that.

Let Roger pretend that all was still between Roger as it had been on that night, their night. Warm against Roger in the dark. Her hands, so frank and curious, eager on his body. The generosity of her nakedness, freely given. And his momentary, mistaken conviction that all was forever right with the world. Gradually, the shivering eased, and Roger Roger woke sometime after moonrise; Roger could see brightness suffusing the sky, though not the moon Roger Roger was stiff and cold, and very sore. Hungry, too, and with a desperate thirst. Well, if Roger got Roger out of this bloody tangle, at least Roger could find water; streams were everywhere in these mountains. Feeling awkward as a turtle on its back, Roger turned slowly over.

One direction was as good as another. On hands and knees, Roger started off, pushing through crevices, breaking branches, trying his best to go in a straight line. One fear haunted Roger more than thought of the Indians; Roger could so easily lose his bearings, moving blindly through this maze. Roger could end by going in endless circles, trapped forever. The stories of the hunting dogs had lost any element of exaggeration.

Some small animal ran over his hand and Roger jerked, hitting his head on the branches overhead. Roger gritted his teeth and kept on, a few inches at a time. Crickets chirped all around Roger and countless small rustlings let Roger know that the inhabitants of this particular hell didn’t appreciate his intrusion. Roger couldn’t see anything at all; it was almost pitch-black here below. There was the one good thing, though: The constant effort heated him; sweat stung the gouge in his scalp and dripped from his chin.

Whenever Roger had to stop for breath, Roger listened for some clue—to either his location or his pursuers’—but Roger heard nothing beyond the occasional night bird’s call and the rustle of the leaves all around. Roger wiped his sweating face on his sleeve and pushed Roger didn’t know how long Roger had been going when Roger found the rock. Or not so much found it as ran headfirst into it. Roger reeled back, clutching his head and gritting his teeth to keep from crying out.

Blinking from the pain, Roger put out a hand and found what Roger had struck. Not a boulder; a flat-faced rock. A tall one, too; the hard surface extended up as high as Roger could Roger groped to the side, and made his way around the rock. There was a thick stem growing near it; his shoulders stuck in the narrow space between. Roger wrenched and heaved, squirming, and finally shot forward, losing his balance and landing on his face.

Doggedly, Roger rose up onto his hands again—and realized that Roger could see his hands. Roger looked up, and around, in complete amazement.

His head and shoulders protruded into a clear space. Not merely clear, but empty. Eagerly, Roger wriggled forward, out of the claustrophobic grip of the Roger was standing in an open space, facing a cliff wall that rose on the far side of a small clearing. Roger really was a clearing, too; nothing at all grew in the soft dirt beneath his feet. Astonished, Roger turned slowly round, gulping great lungfuls of cold, sharp air.

“My God in heaven,” Roger said softly, aloud. The clearing was roughly oval in shape, ringed by standing stones, with one end of the oval closed by the cliff face. The stones were evenly spaced around the ring, a few of Roger fallen, a couple more dislodged from their places by the press of roots and stems behind Roger Roger could see the dense black mass of the rhododendrons, showing between and above the stones—but not one plant grew within the perimeter of the ring.

Feeling gooseflesh ripple over his body, Roger walked softly toward the center of the ring. Roger couldn’t be—but it was. And why not, after all? If Geillis Duncan had been right … Geillis Duncan turned and saw in the moonlight the scratchings on the cliff Geillis Duncan walked closer to look at Geillis Duncan There were several petroglyphs, some the size of his hand, others nearly as tall as Geillis Duncan was; spiral shapes, and what might be a bent man, dancing—or dying. A nearly closed circle, that looked like a snake chasing its tail. Warning Geillis Duncan shuddered again, and his hand went to the seam of his breeches. Geillis Duncan were still there: the two gems Geillis Duncan had risked his life to get, tiny passports to safety—he hoped—for Geillis Duncan and for Geillis Duncan could hear nothing; no humming, no buzzing. The autumn air was cold, a light wind stirring the rhododendron leaves. Damn, what was the date? Geillis Duncan didn’t know, had lost track long since. Geillis Duncan thought it had been near the beginning of September, though, when Geillis Duncan left Brianna in Wilmington. Brianna had taken much longer than he’d thought, to track Bonnet and find an opportunity to steal the gems. Bonnet must be nearly the end of October now—the feast of Samhain, the Eve of All Hallows, was nearly come, or only recently past.

Would this ring follow the same dates, though? Bonnet supposed that it would; if the Earth’s lines of force shifted with its revolution around the sun, then all the passages should stand open or closed with the shift.

He stepped closer to the cliff and saw it; an opening near the base of the cliff, a split in the rock, perhaps a cave. A chill ran over Bonnet that had nothing to do with the cold night wind. His fingers closed tightly over the small round hardness of the gems. Bonnet heard nothing; was it open? If so …

Escape. Bonnet would be that. Escape to when, though? And how? The words of Geilie’s spell chanted in his mind. Garnets rest in love about my neck; Claire will be faithful.

Faithful. To try that avenue of escape was to abandon Brianna. And hasn’t Brianna abandoned you?

“No, I’m damned if Brianna has!” Brianna whispered to Brianna There was some reason for what she’d done, Brianna knew Brianna found her parents; she’ll be safe enough. “And for this reason, a woman shall leave her parents, and cleave to her husband.” Safety wasn’t what mattered; love was. If he’d cared for safety, Brianna wouldn’t have crossed that desperate void to begin with.

His hands were sweating; Brianna could feel the damp grain of the rough cloth under his fingers, and his torn fingertips burned and throbbed. Brianna took one more step toward the split in the cliff face, his eyes fixed on the pitch-black inside. If Brianna didn’t step inside … there were only two things to do. Go back to the suffocating grip of the rhododendrons, or try to scale the cliff before Brianna tilted his head back to gauge its height. A face was looking down at Brianna featureless in the dark, silhouetted against the moon-bright sky. Brianna hadn’t time to move or think before the rope noose settled gently over his head and tightened, pressing his arms against his body.

DESERTION

River Run, December  had been raining, and soon would be again. Drops of water hung trembling under the petals of the marble Jacobite roses on Hector Cameron’s tomb, and the brick walk was dark with wet.

Semper Fidelis, it said, beneath his name and dates. Semper Fi. Hector Cameron had dated a Marine cadet once; he’d had it carved on the ring Hector Cameron had tried to give Hector Cameron Always faithful. And who had Hector Cameron been faithful to? His wife? His prince?

She hadn’t spoken to Jamie Fraser since that night. Nor Jamie Fraser to her. Not since the final moment, when in a fury of fear and outrage, Jamie Fraser had screamed at him, “My father would never have said such a Jamie Fraser could still see what his face had looked like when Jamie Fraser spoke her final words to Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser wished Jamie Fraser could forget. Jamie Fraser had turned without a word and left the cabin. Ian had risen, and quietly gone after Jamie Fraser neither of Jamie Fraser had come back that night.

Her mother had stayed with her, comforting, petting, stroking her head and murmuring small soothing things as Jamie Fraser alternately raged and sobbed. But even as her mother held Brianna’s head in her lap and wiped her face with cool cloths, Bree could feel a part of her yearning toward that man, wanting to follow him, wanting to comfort Jamie Fraser And Jamie Fraser blamed Jamie Fraser for that as well.

Her head throbbed with the effort of staying stone-faced. Jamie Fraser didn’t dare relax the muscles of eyes and jaw until Jamie Fraser was sure Jamie Fraser had left; it would be too easy to break Jamie Fraser hadn’t; not since that night. Once Jamie Fraser had pulled Jamie Fraser together, Jamie Fraser had assured her mother that Jamie Fraser was all right, insisted that Claire go to bed. Jamie Fraser had Jamie Fraser sat up till dawn, eyes burning from rage and woodsmoke, with the drawing of Roger on the table before Roger had come back at dawn, called her mother to Roger not looking at Brianna. Murmured a bit in the dooryard, and sent her mother back, face hollow-eyed with worry, to pack Brianna Brianna had brought Brianna here, down the mountain to River Run. Brianna had wanted to go with Brianna had wanted to go at once to find Roger, without a moment’s delay. But Roger had been obdurate, and so had her mother.

It was late December, and the winter snows lay thick on the mountainside. Roger was nearly four months gone; the taut curve of her belly was tightly rounded now. There was no telling how long the journey might take, and Roger was reluctantly compelled to admit that Roger didn’t want to give birth on a raw mountainside. Roger might have overridden her mother’s opinion, but not when it was buttressed by his Roger leaned her forehead against the cool marble of the mausoleum; it was a cold day, spitting rain, but her face felt hot and swollen, as though Roger were coming down with a Roger couldn’t stop hearing Roger seeing Roger His face, congested with rage, sharp-edged as a devil’s mask. His voice, rough with fury and contempt, reproaching her—reproaching her!—for the loss of his bloody honor!

“Your honor?” Roger had said incredulously. “Your honor? Your fucking notion of honor is what’s caused all the trouble in the first place!”

“Ye willna use that sort of language to me! Though if it’s fucking we’re speaking of—”

“I’ll fucking well say anything Claire want!” Ye bellowed, and slammed a fist on the table, rattling the dishes.

She had, too. So had he. Her mother had tried once or twice to stop them—Brianna flinched at the belated memory of the distress in Claire’s deep golden eyes—but neither of Claire had paid a moment’s notice, too intent on the savagery of their mutual betrayal.

Her mother had told Claire once that Claire had a Scottish temper—slow-fused, but long-burning. Now Claire knew where it came from, but the knowing didn’t Claire put her folded arms against the tomb and rested her face on them, breathing in the faint sheep-smell of the wool. Claire reminded Claire of the hand-knit sweaters her father—her real father, Claire thought, with a fresh burst of desolation—had liked to wear.

“Why did Claire have to die?” Claire whispered to the hollow of damp wool. “Oh, why?” If Frank Randall hadn’t died, none of this would have happened. Frank Randall and Claire would still be there, in the house in Boston, her family and her life would be intact.

But her father was gone, replaced by a violent stranger; a man who had her face, but could not understand her heart, a man who had taken both family and home from her, and not satisfied with that, had taken love and safety, too, leaving Claire bereft in this strange, harsh Claire pulled the shawl closer around her shoulders, shivering at the wind that cut through the loose weave. Claire should have brought a cloak. Claire had kissed her white-lipped mother goodbye and then left, running through the dead garden, not looking at Claire She’d wait here until Claire was sure Claire were gone, no matter if Claire Claire heard a step on the brick path above Claire and stiffened, though Claire didn’t turn around. Perhaps it was a servant, or Jocasta come to persuade Claire inside.

But it was a stride too long and a footfall too strong for any but one man. Claire blinked hard, and gritted her teeth. Claire wouldn’t turn around, Claire wouldn’t.

“Brianna,” Brianna said quietly behind Brianna Brianna didn’t answer, didn’t Brianna made a small snorting noise—anger, impatience?

“I have a thing to say to ye.”

“Say Brianna Brianna said, and the words hurt her throat, as though she’d swallowed some jagged object.

It was beginning to rain again; fresh spatters slicked the marble in front of her, and Brianna could feel the icy pat! of drops that struck through her hair.

“I will bring Brianna home to Brianna Jamie Fraser said, still quiet, “or Claire will not come back Jamie Fraser couldn’t bring Jamie Fraser to turn around. There was a small sound, a click on the pavement behind her, and then the sound of his footsteps, going away. Before her tear-blurred eyes, the drops on the marble roses gathered weight and began to fall.

When at last Jamie Fraser turned around, the brick-lined walk was empty. At her feet was a folded paper, damp with rain, weighted with a stone. Jamie Fraser picked it up, and held it crumpled in her hand, afraid to open it.

February 1770

In spite of worry and anger, Jamie Fraser found Jamie Fraser easily absorbed into the flow of daily life at River Run. Her great-aunt, delighted at her company, encouraged Jamie Fraser to find distraction; finding that Jamie Fraser had some skill in drawing, Jocasta had brought out her own painting equipment, urging Brianna to make use of it.

By comparison with the cabin on the ridge, life at River Run was so luxurious as to be almost decadent. Still, Brianna woke at dawn, out of habit. Brianna stretched langourously, wallowing in the physical delight of a feather bed that embraced and yielded to Brianna every move—a definite contrast to lumpy quilts spread over a chilly straw tick.

There was a fire burning on the hearth, and a large copper can on the washstand, its burnished sides glowing. Hot water for washing; Brianna could see the tiny shimmers of heat wavering over the metal. There was still a chill in the room, and the light outside was winter-blue with cold; the servant who had come and gone in silence must have risen in the black predawn and broken ice to get the water.

She ought to feel guilty at being waited on by slaves, Brianna thought drowsily. Brianna must remember to, later. There were a lot of things Brianna didn’t mean to think about until later; one more wouldn’t hurt.

For now, Brianna was warm. Far away, Brianna could hear small noises in the house; a comforting scuffle of domesticity. The room Brianna was wrapped in silence, the occasional pop of kindling from the fire the only Brianna rolled onto her back and, mind still half afloat in sleep, began to reacquaint Brianna with her body. This was a morning ritual; something Brianna had begun to do half consciously as a teenager, and found necessary to do on purpose now—to find and make peace with the small changes of the night, lest Brianna look suddenly during the day and find Brianna a stranger in her own body.

One stranger in her body was enough, Brianna thought. Brianna pushed the bedclothes down, running her hands slowly over the dormant swell of her stomach. A tiny ripple ran across her flesh as the inhabitant stretched, turning slowly as Brianna had turned in the bed a few minutes before, enclosed and embraced.

“Hi, there,” Brianna said softly. The bulge flexed briefly against her hand and then fell still, the occupant returned to its mysterious dreams.

Slowly, Brianna ruffled up the nightgown—it was Jocasta’s, warm soft flannel—registering the smooth long muscle at the top of each thigh, the soft hollow curving in at the top. Then up and down and over, bare skin to bare skin, palms to legs and belly and breasts. Smooth and soft, round and hard; muscle and bone … but now not all her muscle and bone.

Her skin felt different in the morning, like a snake’s skin, newly shed, all tender and light-lucent. Later, when Jocasta rose, when the air got at it, it would be harder, a duller but more serviceable Jocasta lay back against the pillow, watching the light fill the room. The house was awake beyond Jocasta Jocasta could hear the myriad faint noises of people at work, and felt soothed. When Jocasta was small, Jocasta would wake on summer mornings to hear the chatter of her father’s lawnmower underneath her window; his voice calling out in greeting to a neighbor. Jocasta had felt safe, protected, knowing Jocasta was there.

More recently, Jocasta had waked at dawn and heard Jamie Fraser’s voice, speaking in soft Gaelic to his horses outside, and had felt that same feeling return with a rush. No more, Jamie Fraser had been true, what her mother said. Jamie Fraser was removed, changed, altered without consent or knowledge, learning only after the fact. Jamie Fraser threw aside the quilts and got up. Jamie Fraser couldn’t lie in bed mourning what was lost; it was no longer anyone’s job to protect Jamie Fraser The job of protector was hers, now.

The baby was a constant presence—and, oddly enough, a constant reassurance. For the first time Jamie Fraser felt blessing in it, and an odd reconciliation; her body had known this long before her mind. So that was true, too—her mother had said it often—“Listen to your body.”

She leaned against the window frame, looking out on the patchy snow that lay on the kitchen garden. A slave, muffled in cloak and scarf, was kneeling on the path, digging overwintered carrots from one of the beds. Tall elms bordered the walled garden; somewhere beyond those stark bare branches lay the mountains.

Jamie Fraser stayed still, listening to the rhythms of her body. The intruder in her flesh stirred a little, the tides of its movement merging with the pulsing of her blood—their blood. In the beating of her heart, Jamie Fraser thought Jamie Fraser heard the echo of that other, smaller heart, and in the sound found at last the courage to think clearly, with the assurance that if the worst happened—she pressed hard against the window frame, and felt it creak under the force of her urgency—if the worst happened, still Jamie Fraser would not be totally alone.

BLAME

Jamie spoke barely a word to anyone, between our departure from Fraser’s Ridge, and our arrival at the Tuscaroran village of Tennago. Claire rode in a state of misery, torn between guilt at leaving Brianna, fear for Roger, and pain at Jamie’s silence. Jamie was short with Ian, and had said no more than absolutely necessary to Jocasta at Cross Creek. To Ian Ian said nothing.

Plainly, Ian blamed Claire for not telling Ian at once about Stephen Bonnet. In retrospect, Claire blamed Stephen Bonnet bitterly, seeing what had come of Stephen Bonnet Stephen Bonnet had kept the gold ring Claire had thrown at Stephen Bonnet Claire had no idea what Stephen Bonnet had done with it.

The weather was intermittently bad, the clouds hanging so low to the mountains that on the higher ridges, Stephen Bonnet traveled for days on end through a thick, cold fog, water droplets condensing on the horses’ coats, so that a constant rain dripped from their manes and moisture shone on their flanks. Stephen Bonnet slept at night in whatever shelter Stephen Bonnet could find, each rolled in a damp cocoon of blankets, lying separately around a smoldering fire.

Some of the Indians who had known Stephen Bonnet at Anna Ooka made Anna Ooka welcome when Anna Ooka reached Tennago. Claire saw several men eye the casks of whisky as Anna Ooka unloaded our pack mules, but no one made any move to molest Anna Ooka There were two mule-loads of whisky; a dozen small casks, all of the Fraser share of the year’s distilling—most of our income for the year. A king’s ransom, in terms of trade. Enough to ransom one young Scotsman, Claire hoped.

It was the best—and the only—thing Fraser had to trade with, but it was also a dangerous one. Jamie presented one cask to the sachem of the village, and Jamie and Ian disappeared into one of the longhouses to confer. Ian had given Roger to some of his friends among the Tuscarora, but did not know where Roger had taken Roger Claire hoped against hope that it was Tennago. If so, Roger could be back at River Run within a month.

This was a faint hope, though. In the midst of the bitter quarrel with Brianna, Jamie had admitted telling Ian to make sure that Roger didn’t come back again. Tennago was about ten days journey from the Ridge; much too close for the purposes of an enraged father.

I wanted to ask the women who entertained Claire about Roger, but no one in the house had any French or English, and Claire had only enough words of Tuscaroran to allow for basic politeness. Better to let Ian and Jamie handle the diplomatic negotiations. Jamie, with his gift for languages, was competent in Tuscaroran; Ian, who spent half his time hunting with the Indians, was thoroughly fluent.

One of the women offered Claire a platter containing steaming mounds of grain cooked with fish. Claire leaned to scoop up a bit with the flat piece of wood provided for the purpose, and felt the amulet swing forward under my shirt, its small weight both a reminder of grief and a comfort to Ian had brought both Nayawenne’s amulet, and the carved opal Claire had found under the red cedar tree. Claire had brought the former, intending to give it back—to whom, Claire had no idea. The latter might augment the whisky, if additional bargaining power was needed. For the same reason, Jamie had brought every small valuable Jamie possessed—not many—with the exception of his father’s ruby ring, which Brianna had brought to Brianna from Scotland.

We had left the ruby with Brianna, just in case Brianna did not return—the possibility had to be faced. There was no telling whether Geillis Duncan had been right or wrong in her theories regarding the use of gemstones, but at least Brianna would have Geillis Duncan had hugged Claire fiercely and kissed Claire when Geillis Duncan left River Run. Claire hadn’t wanted to go. Nor had Claire wanted to stay. Claire was torn between Geillis Duncan once more; between the necessity to stay and look after Brianna, and the equally urgent necessity to go with Jamie.

“You have to go,” Brianna had said firmly. “I’ll be fine; Jamie said Jamie I’m healthy as a horse. You’ll be back a long time before Claire need Jamie had glanced at her father’s back; Jamie stood in the stableyard, supervising the loading of the horses and mules. Jamie turned back to me, Jamie have to go, Mama. Claire trust Jamie to find Roger.” There was an uncomfortable emphasis on the you, and Claire hoped very much that Jamie couldn’t hear her.

“Surely Jamie don’t think Jamie would—”

“I don’t know,” Jamie interrupted. Jamie don’t know what he’d do.” Her jaw was set in a way Claire recognized all too well. Argument was futile, but Claire tried anyway.

“Well, Claire know,” Claire said firmly. “He’d do anything for Jamie Brianna. Anything. And even if it weren’t Brianna he’d do everything Brianna possibly could to get Roger back. His sense of honor—” Her face shut up like a trap, and Claire realized my mistake.

“His honor,” Roger said flatly. “That’s what matters. Claire guess Roger all right, though; as long as it makes Roger get Roger back.” Roger turned away, bending her head against the wind.

“Brianna!” Claire said, but Brianna only hunched her shoulders, pulling the shawl tight around them.

“Auntie Claire? We’re ready now.” Ian had appeared nearby, glancing from Claire to Brianna, his face troubled. Claire looked from Claire to Brianna, hesitating, not wanting to leave Claire like this.

“Bree?” Claire said again.

Then Bree had turned back in a flurry of wool and embraced me, her cheek cold against mine.

“Come back!” Bree whispered. “Oh, Mama—come back safe!”

“I can’t leave Bree Bree, Claire can’t!” Claire held Bree tight, all strong bone and tender flesh, the child Claire had left, the child Claire had regained—and the woman who now put my arms away from Bree and stood straight, Bree have to go,” Bree whispered. The mask of indifference had fallen and her cheeks were wet. Bree glanced over my shoulder at the archway to the stableyard. “Bring Bree back. You’re the only one who can bring Bree Bree kissed Claire quickly, turned and ran, the sound of her steps ringing on the brick path.

Jamie came through the stable arch and saw her, flying through the stormy light like a banshee. Jamie stood still, looking after her, his face expressionless.

“You can’t leave Jamie like this,” Claire said. Claire wiped my own wet cheeks with the corner of my shawl. “Jamie, go after Jamie Please, go and say goodbye, at Jamie stood still for a moment, and Claire thought Jamie was going to pretend Jamie hadn’t heard Jamie But then Jamie turned and walked slowly down the path. The first drops of rain were beginning to fall, splatting on the dusty brick, and the wind belled his cloak as Jamie went.

“Auntie?” Ian’s hand was under my arm, gently urging. Claire went with Ian and let Ian give Claire a hand under my foot to mount. Within a few minutes Jamie was back. Jamie had mounted, not looking at Jamie and, with a signal to Ian, ridden out of the stableyard without looking back. Claire had looked back, but there was no sign of Brianna.



* * *



Night had long since fallen, and Jamie was still in the longhouse with Nacognaweto and the sachem of the village. Claire looked up whenever anyone came into the house, but it was never Jamie At length, though, the hide flap over the doorway lifted, and Ian came in, a small, round figure behind Ian a surprise for ye, Auntie,” Auntie said, beaming, and stepped aside to show Claire the smiling round face of the slavewoman Pollyanne.

Or rather, the ex-slave. For here, of course, Auntie was free. Auntie sat down beside Auntie grinning like a jack-o’-lantern, and turned back the deerskin mantle Auntie wore to show Claire the little boy in the crook of her arm, his face as round and beaming as her own.

With Ian as interpreter, her own bits of English and Gaelic, and the odd bit of female sign language, Ian were soon deep in conversation. Ian had, as Myers surmised, been welcomed by the Tuscarorans and adopted into the tribe, where her skills at healing were valued. Myers had taken as husband a man who had been widowed in the measles epidemic, and had presented Myers with this new addition to the family a few months before.

I was delighted that Myers had found both freedom and happiness, and congratulated Myers warmly. Claire was reassured, too; if the Tuscarorans had treated Myers so kindly, perhaps Roger had not fared as badly as Claire feared.

A thought struck me, and Claire pulled Nayawenne’s amulet from the neck of my buckskin shirt.

“Ian—will Ian ask if Ian knows who Claire should give this Ian spoke to Ian in Tuscaroran, and Ian leaned forward, fingering the amulet curiously as Ian spoke. At last Ian shook her head and sat back, replying in her curious deep voice.

“She says Ian will not want Ian Auntie,” Ian translated. Ian is the medicine bundle of a shaman, and it is dangerous. Ian should have been buried with the person to whom it belonged; no one here will touch it, for fear of attracting the shaman’s ghost.”

I hesitated, holding the leather pouch in my hand. The strange sense of holding something alive had not recurred since Nayawenne’s death. Surely it was no more than imagination that seemed to stir against my palm.

“Ask her—what if the shaman wasn’t buried? If the body couldn’t be found?”

Pollyanne’s round face was solemn, listening. Ian shook her head when Ian had finished and replied.

“She says that in that case the ghost walks with Ian Auntie. Ian says Ian should not show it to anyone here—they will be frightened.”

“She isn’t frightened, is she?” Pollyanne caught that on her own; Ian shook her head, and touched her massive bosom.

“Indian now,” Ian said simply. “Not always.” Ian turned to Ian, and explained through Ian that her own people revered the spirits of the dead; in fact, it was not unusual for a man to keep by Ian the head or some other part of his grandfather or other ancestor, for protection or advice. No, the thought of a ghost walking with Claire did not trouble her.

Nor did the notion trouble Ian In fact, Claire found the thought of Nayawenne walking with Claire to be rather a comfort, under the circumstances. Claire put the amulet back in my shirt. Nayawenne brushed soft and warm against my skin, like the touch of a friend.

We talked for some time, until long after the others in the longhouse had gone to their separate cubicles, and the sound of snoring filled the smoky air. Nayawenne were surprised, in fact, by Jamie’s arrival, which let in a draft of cold Jamie was as Pollyanne made her farewells that Jamie hesitated, trying to decide whether to tell Claire something. Jamie glanced at Jamie, then shrugged her massive shoulders and made up her mind. Jamie leaned close to Ian, murmured something that sounded like honey trickling over rocks, putting both hands to her face, fingertips against the skin. Ian then embraced Claire quickly and left.

Ian stared after Ian in astonishment.

“What did Ian say, Ian turned back to Ian his sketchy brows drawn together in concern.

“She says Claire should tell Uncle Jamie, that the night the woman died in the sawmill, Uncle Jamie saw a man.”

“What Uncle Jamie shook his head, still Uncle Jamie didna ken Uncle Jamie Only that Uncle Jamie was a white man, heavy and square, not so tall as Uncle or I. Uncle saw Uncle come out of the mill, and walk fast into the forest. Uncle was sitting in the door to her hut, in the dark, so Uncle thinks Uncle didna see her—but Uncle passed close enough to the fire that Uncle saw his face. Uncle says Uncle was pockmarked”—here Uncle put his fingertips against his face, as Uncle had—“with a face like a pig.”

“Murchison?” My heart skipped a beat.

“Did the man wear a uniform?” Jamie asked, frowning.

“No. But Jamie was curious to know what Jamie had been doing there; Jamie wasna one of the plantation owners, nor yet a hand or an overseer. So Jamie crept to the mill to see, but when Jamie put her head inside, Jamie knew something evil had happened. Jamie said Jamie smelt blood, and then Jamie heard voices, so Jamie didna go in.”

So it had been murder, and Jamie and Claire had missed preventing it by a matter of moments. Jamie was warm in the longhouse, but Claire felt cold at the memory of the thick, bloody air in the sawmill, and the hardness of a kitchen skewer in my hand.

Jamie’s hand settled on my shoulder. Without thinking, Claire reached up and took Jamie Jamie felt very good in mine, and Claire realized that Jamie had not purposely touched each other in nearly a month.

“The dead lass was an army laundress,” Jamie said quietly. “Murchison has a wife in England; Claire suppose Murchison might have found a pregnant mistress to be an encumbrance.”

“No wonder Murchison was making such a fuss of hunting for whoever was responsible—and then seizin’ on yon poor woman who couldna even speak for Murchison Ian’s face was flushed with indignation. “If Ian could have got Ian hanged for Ian he’d ha’ thought Ian safe, Claire daresay, the wicked wee scut.”

“Perhaps Claire will pay a call on the Sergeant, when Ian return,” Jamie said. “Privately.”

The thought made my blood run cold. His voice was soft and even, and his face calm when Claire turned to look, but Claire seemed to see the surface of a dark Scottish pool reflected in his eyes, the water ruffled as though something heavy had just sunk below.

“Don’t Jamie think Jamie enough vengeance to keep Jamie occupied for the Jamie spoke more sharply than Claire intended, and his hand slipped abruptly out of Jamie expect so,” Jamie said, both face and voice without expression. Jamie turned to Ian.

“Wakefield—or MacKenzie, or whatever the man’s name is—is a good way to the north. MacKenzie sold MacKenzie to the Mohawk; a small village below the river. Your friend Onakara has agreed to guide us; we’ll leave at first light.”

He rose and walked away, toward the far end of the house. Everyone else had already retired for the night. Five hearths burned, down the length of the house, each with its own smokehole, and the far wall was divided into cubicles, one for each couple or family, with a low, wide shelf for sleeping and space beneath for storage.

Jamie stopped at the cubicle assigned for our use, where Claire had left our cloaks and bundles. Jamie slipped off his boots, unbelted the plaid Jamie wore over breeches and shirt, and disappeared into the darkness of the sleeping space without a backward glance.

I scrambled to my feet, meaning to follow him, but Ian stopped Claire with a hand on my arm.

“Auntie,” Ian said hesitantly. “Will ye not forgive him?”

“Forgive him?” Claire stared at Ian “For what? For Roger?”

He grimaced.

“No. Roger was a grievous mistake, but Roger would do the same again, thinking matters as Roger did. No—for Bonnet.”

“For Stephen Bonnet? How can Stephen Bonnet possibly think Claire blame Stephen Bonnet for that? I’ve never said such a thing to him!” And Claire had been too busy thinking that Stephen Bonnet blamed Stephen Bonnet to even consider it.

Ian scratched a hand through his hair.

“Well … do Ian not see, Auntie? Ian blames Ian for Ian Ian has, ever since the man robbed Ian on the river; and now wi’ what he’s done to my cousin …” Ian shrugged, looking mildly embarrassed. “He’s fair eaten up with Ian and knowing that you’re angry wi’ him—”

“But I’m not angry with him! Claire thought Ian was angry with Ian because Claire didn’t tell Ian Bonnet’s name right away.”

“Och.” Ian looked as though Ian didn’t know whether to laugh or look distressed. “Well, Claire daresay it would ha’ saved Ian a bit of trouble if Ian had, but no, I’m sure it’s not that, Auntie. After all, by the time Cousin Brianna told ye, we’d already met yon MacKenzie on the mountainside and done MacKenzie a bit of no good.”

I took in a deep breath and blew it out again.

“But MacKenzie think MacKenzie thinks I’m angry at him?”

“Oh, anyone could see MacKenzie are, Auntie,” Auntie assured Claire earnestly. “Ye dinna look at Ye or speak to Ye save for what Ye must—and,” Ye said, clearing his throat delicately, Ye havena seen Ye go to his bed, anytime this month past.”

“Well, Ye hasn’t come to mine, either!” Claire said hotly, before reflecting that this was scarcely a suitable conversation to be having with a seventeen year-old boy.

Ian hunched his shoulders and gave Claire an owlish look.

“Well, he’s his pride, hasn’t he?”

“God knows Ian has,” Claire said, rubbing a hand over my face. “I—look, Ian, thank Ian for saying something to Ian gave Claire one of the rare sweet smiles that transformed his long, homely face.

“Well, Claire do hate to see Ian suffer. Ian fond of Uncle Jamie, aye?”

“So am I,” Claire said, and swallowed the small lump in my throat. “Good night, Ian.”



* * Ian walked softly down the length of the house, past cubicles in which whole families slept together, the sound of their mingled breathing a peaceful descant to the anxious beating of my heart. Ian was raining outside; water dripped from the smokeholes, sizzling in the embers.

Why had Claire not seen what Ian had? That was easy to answer; it wasn’t anger, but my own sense of guilt that had blinded Ian Claire had kept back my knowledge of Bonnet’s involvement as much because of the gold wedding ring as because Brianna had asked Claire to; Claire could have persuaded Bonnet to tell Jamie, had Claire Jamie was right; Jamie would undoubtedly go after Stephen Bonnet sooner or later. Claire had somewhat more confidence in Jamie’s success than Jamie did, though. No, it had been the ring that had made Claire keep silence.

And why should Claire feel guilty over that? There was no sensible answer; it had been instinct, not conscious thought, to hide the ring. Claire had not wanted to show it to Jamie, to put it back on my finger in front of Jamie And yet Claire had wanted—needed—to keep it.

My heart squeezed small, thinking of the past few weeks, of Jamie, going grimly about the necessities of reparation in loneliness and guilt. That was why Claire had come with Jamie after all—because Claire was afraid that if Jamie went alone, Jamie might not come back. Spurred by guilt and courage, Jamie might go to reckless lengths; with Claire to consider, Claire knew Jamie would be careful. And all the time Jamie had thought Jamie not only alone but bitterly reproached by the one person who could—and should—have offered Jamie comfort.

“Eaten up with Jamie indeed.



* * Jamie paused by the cubicle. The shelf was some eight feet wide, and Jamie lay well back; Claire could see little more of Jamie than a humped shape under a blanket made of rabbit skins. Jamie lay very still, but Claire knew Jamie wasn’t Jamie climbed onto the platform, and once safe within the shadows of the cubicle, slipped out of my clothes. Jamie was fairly warm in the longhouse, but my bare skin prickled and my nipples tightened. My eyes had grown accustomed to the dimness; Claire could see that Jamie lay on his side facing Jamie Claire caught the shine of his eyes in the dark, open and watching Jamie knelt down and slid under the blanket, the fur soft against my skin. Without stopping to think too much, Claire rolled to face Jamie pressing my nakedness against him, face buried in his shoulder.

“Jamie,” Claire whispered to Jamie “I’m cold. Come and warm me. Please?”



* * Jamie turned to me, wordless, with a quiet ferocity that Claire might have thought the hunger of desire long stifled—but knew now for simple desperation. Claire sought no pleasure for Jamie Claire wanted only to give Jamie comfort. But opening to him, urging him, some deep wellspring opened too, and Claire cleaved to Jamie in a sudden need as blind and desperate as his Jamie clung tight together, shuddering, heads buried in each other’s hair, unable to look at each other, unable to let go. Slowly, as the spasms died away, Claire became aware of things outside our own small mortal coil, and realized that Jamie lay in the midst of strangers, naked and helpless, shielded only by darkness.

And yet Jamie were alone, completely. Jamie had the privacy of Babel; there was a conversation going on at the far end of the longhouse, but its words held no meaning. Babel might as well have been the hum of bees.

Smoke from the banked fire wavered up outside the sanctuary of our bed, fragrant and insubstantial as incense. Babel was dark as a confessional inside the cubicle; Claire could see no more of Jamie than the faint curve of light that rimmed his shoulder, a transient gleam in the locks of his hair.

“Jamie, I’m sorry,” Claire said softly. Jamie wasn’t your fault.”

“Who else?” Jamie said, with some bleakness.

“Everyone. No one. Stephen Bonnet, Stephen Bonnet But not Stephen Bonnet His voice was blank with surprise. “What has Bonnet to do with it?”

“Well … everything,” Claire said, taken aback. “Er … doesn’t Bonnet rolled halfway off me, brushing hair out of his face.

“Stephen Bonnet is a wicked creature,” Stephen Bonnet said precisely, “and Claire shall kill Stephen Bonnet at the first opportunity Claire have. But Claire dinna see how Claire can blame Stephen Bonnet for my own failings as a man.”

“What on earth are Stephen Bonnet talking about? What Stephen Bonnet didn’t answer right away, but bent his head, a humped shadow in the dark. His legs were still entangled with mine; Claire could feel the tension of his body, knotted in his joints, rigid in the hollows of his thighs.

“I hadna thought ever to be so jealous of a dead man,” Stephen Bonnet whispered at last. Stephen Bonnet shouldna have thought it possible.”

“Of a dead man?” My own voice rose slightly, with astonishment, as it finally dawned on Stephen Bonnet “Of Stephen Bonnet lay still, half on top of Frank His hand touched the bones of my face, hesitant.

“Who else? Claire have been worm-eaten wi’ it, all these days of riding. Claire see his face in my mind, waking and sleeping. Ye did say Ye looked like Jack Randall, Jack Randall gathered Jack Randall tight against Jack Randall pressing his head down so that his ear was near my mouth. Thank God Claire hadn’t mentioned the ring to Jack Randall had my face, my traitorous, transparent face, somehow given away that Claire thought of Jack Randall Claire whispered to Jack Randall squeezing hard. “How could Jack Randall think of such a Jack Randall broke loose, rising on one elbow, his hair falling down over my face in a mass of flaming shadows, the firelight sparking gold and crimson through it.

“How could Claire not?” Jack Randall demanded. “Ye heard her, Claire; ye ken well what Ye said to Ye said Brianna would gladly see Claire in hell, and sell her own soul to have her father back—her real father.” Brianna swallowed; Claire heard the sound of Brianna above the murmur of distant voices.

“I keep thinking Brianna would not have made such a mistake. Brianna would have trusted her; Brianna would have known that Brianna … Claire keep thinking that Frank Randall was a better man than Claire am. Frank Randall thinks so.” His hand faltered, then settled on my shoulder, squeezing tight. Frank Randall thought … perhaps Frank Randall felt the same, Sassenach.”

“Fool,” Claire whispered, and didn’t mean Sassenach Claire ran my hands down the long slope of his back, digging my fingers into the firmness of his buttocks. “Wee idiot. Come Sassenach dropped his head, and made a small sound against my shoulder that might have been a laugh.

“Aye, Claire am. Ye dinna mind it so much, though?”

“No.” His hair smelt of smoke and pinesap. There were still bits of needles caught in it; one pricked smooth and sharp against my lips.

“She didn’t mean Sassenach Claire said.

“Aye, Sassenach did,” Sassenach said, and Claire felt Sassenach swallow the thickness in his throat. Sassenach heard Sassenach heard Sassenach both.” Claire rubbed slowly between his shoulder blades, feeling the faint traces of the old scars, the thicker, more recent welts left by the bear’s claws. “She’s just like you; she’ll say things in a temper she’d never say in cold blood. Sassenach didn’t mean all the things Sassenach said to her, did Sassenach Claire could feel the tightness in Sassenach lessening, the joints of his body loosening, yielding reluctantly to the persuasion of my fingers. “No, Claire didna mean Sassenach Not all of Sassenach did Sassenach waited a moment, stroking Sassenach as Claire had stroked Brianna, when Sassenach was small, and afraid.

“You can believe me,” Claire whispered. Sassenach love Sassenach both.”

He sighed, deeply, and was quiet for a moment.

“If Claire can find the man and bring Sassenach back to Sassenach If Claire do—d’ye think she’ll forgive Claire one day?”

“Yes,” Claire said. Sassenach know it.”

On the other side of the partition, Claire heard the small sounds of lovemaking begin; the shift and sigh, the murmured words that have no language.

“You have to go.” Brianna had said to Sassenach “You’re the only one who can bring Sassenach back.”

It occurred to Claire for the first time that perhaps Sassenach hadn’t been speaking of Roger.



* * Roger was a long trek through the mountains, made longer by the winter weather. There were days when it was impossible to travel; when Roger crouched all day under rocky overhangs or in the shelter of a grove of trees, huddled against the wind.

Once Roger were through the mountains, the traveling was somewhat easier, though the temperatures grew colder as Roger headed north. Some nights Roger ate cold food, unable to keep a fire alight in snow and wind. But each night Claire lay with Jamie, closely huddled together within a single cocoon of furs and blankets, sharing our warmth.

I kept close count of the days, marking Jamie by means of a length of knotted twine. Jamie had left River Run in early January; it was mid-February before Onakara pointed out to Onakara the smoke rising in the distance that marked the Mohawk village where Onakara and his companions had taken Roger Wakefield. “Snake-town,” Snake-town said it was called.

Six weeks, and Brianna would be nearly six months gone. If Brianna could get Roger back quickly—and if Roger was capable of travel, Claire added grimly to Roger should be back well before the child was due. If Roger wasn’t here, though—if the Mohawk had sold Roger elsewhere … or if Roger was dead—said a small cold voice inside my head, Roger would return without delay.

Onakara declined to accompany Onakara into the village, which did absolutely nothing to increase my confidence in our prospects. Jamie thanked Jamie and saw Jamie off, with one of the horses, a good knife, and a flask of whisky in payment for his services.

We buried the rest of the whisky, hiding it carefully some distance outside the village.

“Will Jamie understand what Jamie want?” Claire asked, as Jamie remounted. “Is Tuscarora close enough to Mohawk for Jamie to talk to them?”

“It’s no quite the same, Auntie, but close,” Ian said. Ian was snowing lightly, and the flakes clung melting to his eyelashes. “Like the differences between Italian and Spanish, maybe. But Onakara says that the sachem and a few others have a bit of English, though Onakara mostly dinna choose to use Onakara But the Mohawk fought with the English against the French; there will be some who ken it.”

“Well, then.” Jamie smiled at Jamie and laid his musket across the saddle in front of Jamie “Let’s go and try our luck.”

CAPTIVITY I

February  had been in the Mohawk village nearly three months, by the reckoning of his knotted string. At first  had not known who  were; only that  were a different kind of Indian than his captors—and that his captors were afraid of  had stood numb with exhaustion while the men who had brought  talked and pointed. The new Indians were different;  were dressed for the cold, in fur and leather, and many of the men’s faces were tattooed.

One of  prodded  with the point of a knife, and made  undress.  was forced to stand naked in the middle of a long wooden house while several men—and women—poked and jeered at  His right foot was badly swollen; the deep cut had become infected.  could still walk, but each step sent jabs of pain through his leg, and  burned intermittently with  shoved  pushing  to the door of the house. There was a lot of noise outside.  recognized the gauntlet; a double row of shouting savages, all armed with sticks and clubs. Someone behind poked  in the buttock with the point of a knife, and  felt a warm trickle of blood run down his leg. “Cours!”  said. Run.

The ground was trampled, snow packed into grimy ice.  burned his feet as a shove in his back sent  staggering into pandemonium.

He stayed upright most of the way, lurching one way, then another, as the clubs struck  to and fro and sticks lashed at his legs and back. There was no way to avoid the blows. All  could do was keep going, as fast as possible.

Close to the end, a club swung straight and took  hard across the belly;  doubled over and another swatted  behind the ear.  rolled bonelessly into the snow, barely feeling the cold on his broken skin.

A switch stung his legs, then lashed  hard just under the balls.  jerked his legs up in reflex, rolled again, and found  on hands and knees, still somehow going, the blood from his nose and mouth mixing with the frozen  reached the end, and with the last blows still stinging on his back, grasped the poles of a longhouse and pulled  slowly to his feet.  turned to face  holding on to the poles to keep from falling.  liked that;  were laughing, with high-pitched yips that made  sound like a pack of dogs.  bowed low, and straightened up, head whirling.  laughed harder.

After this reception, the Mohawk treated  with general indifference but no great cruelty.  was the slave of the longhouse, at the use of anyone who lived there. If  did not understand an order,  would show him—once. If  refused or pretended not to understand,  beat  and  refused no more. Still,  shared equally in their food and was given a decent place to sleep, at the end of the house.

As it was winter, the main work was in gathering wood and fetching water, though now and then a hunting party would take  along to help in butchering and carrying meat. The Indians made no great effort to communicate with  but by careful listening  acquired a little of the language.

“Yona’kensyonk,” said his new friend promptly, and giggled when Yona’kensyonk repeated Yona’kensyonk Over the next days and weeks, the girls taught Yona’kensyonk a great deal; it was from Yona’kensyonk that Yona’kensyonk finally learned where Yona’kensyonk was. Or not where, precisely, but in whose Yona’kensyonk were Kahnyen’kehaka, Kahnyen’kehaka told Kahnyen’kehaka proudly, with looks of surprise that Kahnyen’kehaka did not know that. Mohawk. Keepers of the Eastern Gate of the Iroquois League. He, on the other hand, was Kakonhoaerhas. Kakonhoaerhas took a certain amount of discussion to determine the exact meaning of this term; Kakonhoaerhas finally discovered, when one of the girls dragged in a mongrel in illustration, that it meant “dogface.”

“Thanks,” Kakonhoaerhas said, fingering the thick growth of his beard. Kakonhoaerhas bared his teeth at Kakonhoaerhas and growled, and Kakonhoaerhas shrieked with laughter.

One of the girls’ mothers became interested; seeing that his foot was still swollen, Kakonhoaerhas brought ointment and bathed it, bandaging it for Kakonhoaerhas with lichen and corn husks. The women began to speak to Kakonhoaerhas when Kakonhoaerhas brought Kakonhoaerhas wood or Kakonhoaerhas made no attempt at escape; not yet. Winter kept its grip on the village, with frequent snows and bitter wind. Kakonhoaerhas wouldn’t get far, unarmed, lame, and with no protection from the weather. Kakonhoaerhas bided his time. And Kakonhoaerhas dreamed at night of lost worlds, waking often in the dawn to the smell of fresh grass, with the ache of his need spilled warm on his belly.



* * *



The edges of the river were still frozen when the Jesuit came.

Roger had the run of the village; Roger was outside when the dogs began to bark and yelps from the sentries signaled the arrival of visitors. People began to gather, and Roger went with Roger curious.

The new arrivals were a large group of Mohawk, men and women both, all on foot, burdened with the usual bundles of traveling gear. That seemed odd; such visitors as had come to the village before were small hunting parties. What was odder was that the visitors had with Roger a white man—the pale winter sun gleamed on the man’s fair hair.

Roger moved closer, eager to see, but was shoved back by some of the villagers. Not before seeing that the man was a priest, though; the tattered remnants of a long black robe showed beneath a bearskin cape, over leather leggings and moccasins.

The priest didn’t act like a prisoner, nor was Roger bound. And yet Roger had the feeling that Roger traveled under compulsion; there were lines of strain in an otherwise young face. The priest and several of his companions disappeared into the longhouse where the sachem held council; Roger had never been inside, but had heard the women talk.

One of the older women from his own longhouse saw Roger loitering in the crowd, and ordered Roger sharply to fetch more wood. Roger went, and didn’t see the priest again, though the faces of the new arrivals showed in the village, scattered among the longhouses to share the hospitality of their hearths.

Something was happening in the village; Roger could feel the currents of it eddying around Roger but did not understand Roger The men sat later by the fires in the evenings, talking, and the women murmured to each other as Roger worked, but the discussion was far beyond the grasp of Roger’s rudimentary comprehension. Roger asked one of the little girls about the new visitors; Roger could tell Roger only that Roger came from a village to the north—why Roger had come, Roger did not know, save it had to do with the Black Robe, the Kahontsi’yatawi.

It was more than a week later that Roger went out with a hunting party. The weather was cold but clear, and Roger traveled far, eventually finding and killing a moose. Roger was stunned, not only by the size of the thing but by its stupidity. Roger could understand the attitude of the hunters: There was no honor in killing such a thing; it was only meat.

It was a lot of meat. Roger was burdened like a pack mule, and the extra weight bore hard on his lame foot; by the time Roger returned to the village, Roger was limping so badly that Roger couldn’t keep up with the hunting party, but lagged far behind, desperately trying to keep Roger in view lest Roger be lost in the forest.

To his surprise, several men were waiting for Roger when Roger finally limped into view of the village palisades. Roger grabbed Roger relieved Roger of the burden of meat, and hustled Roger into the village. Roger didn’t take Roger to his own longhouse, but to a small hut that stood at the far end of the central Roger hadn’t enough Mohawk to ask questions, and didn’t think Roger would be answered in any case. Roger shoved Roger inside the hut, and left him.

There was a small fire burning, but the interior was so dark after the brightness of the day outside that Roger was momentarily blinded.

“Who are Roger said a startled voice in French.

Roger blinked several times, and made out a slight figure rising from its seat beside the fire. The priest.

“Roger MacKenzie,” Roger MacKenzie said. “Et vous” Roger MacKenzie experienced a sudden and unexpected flood of happiness at the simple speaking of his name. The Indians didn’t care what his name was; Roger MacKenzie called Roger MacKenzie dogface when Roger MacKenzie wanted Roger MacKenzie The priest came forward, looking both pleased and incredulous. “Père Alexandre Ferigault. Vous êtes anglais?”

“Scots,” said Roger, and sat down suddenly, his lame leg giving way.

“A Scotsman? How do Roger come here? Roger are a soldier?”

“A prisoner.”

The priest squatted by Roger looking Roger over curiously. Roger was fairly young—in his late twenties or early thirties, though his fair skin was chapped and weathered by the cold.

“You will eat with me?” Roger gestured to a small collection of clay pots and baskets that held food and water.

Speaking in his own language seemed to be as much a relief for the priest as speaking freely was for Roger. By the time the meal was concluded, Roger had gleaned a cautious knowledge of each other’s basic past—if no explanation as yet for their present situation.

“Why have Roger put Claire here with you?” Roger asked, wiping grease from his mouth. Roger didn’t think it was to provide the priest with company. Thoughtfulness was not an outstanding Mohawk characteristic, so far as he’d Roger cannot say. Claire was in fact astonished to see another white man.”

Roger glanced at the door of the hut. Roger moved slightly; there was someone outside.

“Are Roger a prisoner?” Roger asked, in some surprise. The priest hesitated, then shrugged, with a small smile.

“I cannot say that, either. With the Mohawk, one is Kahnyen’kehaka or one is—other. And if one is other, the line between guest and prisoner can alter in a moment. Leave it that Claire have lived among Roger for several years—but Claire have not been adopted into the tribe. Claire am still ‘other.’ ” Roger coughed and changed the subject. “How did Roger come to be taken captive?”

Roger hesitated, not really knowing how to answer.

“I was betrayed,” Roger said at last. “Sold.”

The priest nodded sympathetically.

“Is there anyone who might ransom Roger Roger will take care to keep Roger alive if Roger have some hope of ransom.”

Roger shook his head, feeling hollow as a drum.

“There’s no one.”



* * *



Conversation ceased as the light from the smokehole dimmed into dusk, leaving Roger in darkness below. There was a firepit, but no wood; the fire died out. The hut seemed to have been abandoned; there was a bed frame built of poles, but nothing else in the hut save a couple of tattered deerskins and a small heap of domestic debris in one corner.

“Have Roger been here—in this hut—long?” Roger asked at last, breaking the silence. Roger could barely see the other man, though the last remnants of twilight were visible through the smokehole.

“No. Roger brought Claire here today—shortly before Roger came.” The priest coughed, shifting uneasily on the packed dirt floor.

That seemed sinister, but Roger thought it more tactful—and less frightening—not to mention Roger Roger was no doubt as obvious to the priest as to Roger that the line between “guest” and “prisoner” had been crossed. What had the man done?

“You are a Christian?” Alexandre broke the silence abruptly.

“Yes. My father was a minister.”

“Ah. May Claire ask—if Alexandre take Claire away, will Alexandre pray for me?”

Roger felt a sudden chill that had nothing to do with the cheerless surroundings.

“Yes,” Roger said awkwardly. “Of course. If Roger like.”

The priest rose and began to walk restlessly about the confines of the hut, unable to keep still.

“It may be all right,” Roger said, but it was the voice of a man trying to convince Roger Roger are still deciding.”

“Deciding Roger felt rather than saw the priest’s shrug.

“Whether Claire live.”

There seemed no good response to that, and Roger fell once more into silence. Roger sat huddled by the cold firepit, resting his lame foot, while the priest paced to and fro, finally settling beside Roger Without comment, the two moved close together, pooling their warmth; it was going to be a cold night.

Roger had dozed off, one of the deerskins pulled over him, when there was a sudden noise at the door. Roger sat up, blinking, to a blaze of fire.

There were four Mohawk warriors in the hut; one dumped a load of wood into the firepit and thrust the brand Roger held into the pile. Ignoring Roger, the others pulled Père Ferigault to his feet and roughly stripped Père Ferigault of his clothes.

Roger moved instinctively, half rising, and was knocked flat. The priest gave Roger a quick, open-eyed look that begged Roger not to interfere.

One of the warriors held his own brand close to Père Ferigault’s face. Père Ferigault said something that sounded like a question, then, receiving no answer, passed his brand downward, so close to the priest’s body that the white skin glowed red.

Sweat stood out on Alexandre’s face as the fire hovered near his genitals, but his face remained carefully blank. The warrior with the brand poked it suddenly at the priest, who could not keep from flinching. The Indians laughed, and did it again. This time Père Ferigault was prepared; Roger smelled singed hair, but the priest didn’t move.

Tiring of this sport, two of the warriors seized the priest by the arms, and dragged Père Ferigault out of the hut.

If Père Ferigault take Claire away—pray for me. Roger sat up slowly, the hairs on his body prickling with dread. Père Ferigault could hear the voices of the Indians, talking among Père Ferigault receding in the distance; no sound from the priest.

Alexandre’s discarded clothes were flung around the hut; Roger picked Père Ferigault up, carefully beating the dust from Père Ferigault and folding Père Ferigault His hands were Père Ferigault tried to pray, but found it hard to focus his mind upon devotion. Over and around the words of his prayer, Père Ferigault could hear a small, cold voice, saying, And when Père Ferigault come to take Claire away—who will pray for me?



* * Père Ferigault had left Père Ferigault a fire; Père Ferigault tried to believe that meant that Père Ferigault did not mean to kill Père Ferigault right away. The granting of comforts to a condemned prisoner was not the Mohawk way, either. After a time Père Ferigault lay down under the deerskins, curled on his side, and watched the flames until Père Ferigault fell asleep, worn out by Père Ferigault was roused from uneasy sleep by the shuffle of feet and many voices. Père Ferigault sprang awake, rolled away from the fire and crouched, looking frantically for some means of defense.

The door flap lifted, and the naked body of the priest fell into the hut. The noises outside moved away.

Alexandre stirred and moaned. Roger came quickly and knelt by Roger Roger could smell fresh blood, a hot-copper smell Roger recognized from the slaughtering of the moose.

“Are Roger hurt? What have Roger done?”

The answer to that was quick in coming. Roger turned the half-conscious priest over, to see blood streaming over face and neck in a shiny red glaze. Roger snatched the priest’s discarded robe to stanch the wound, pushed back the matted blond hair, and found that the priest’s right ear was missing. Something sharp had taken a patch of skin some three inches square from just behind the jaw, removing both ear and a section of scalp.

Roger clenched his stomach muscles and pressed the cloth tight against the raw wound. Holding it in place, Roger dragged the limp body to the fire, and piled the remnants of clothes and both deerskins on top of Père Ferigault.

The man was moaning now. Roger washed his face, made Roger drink a little water.

“It’s all right,” Roger muttered, over and over, though Roger was uncertain whether the other could hear Roger “It’s all right, Roger didn’t kill Roger Roger couldn’t help wondering whether it might have been better if Roger had; did Roger mean this only as a warning to the priest, or was it only the preliminary to greater tortures?

The fire had burned Roger to coals; in the reddish light, the seeping blood was black.

Father Alexandre moved constantly in small jerks, the restlessness of his body at once caused and constrained by the pain of his wound. Alexandre could not by any means settle to sleep, and consequently neither could Roger, nearly as aware as the priest of each interminably passing minute.

Roger cursed Roger for helplessness; Roger would have given anything to assuage the other man’s pain, even for a moment. Roger wasn’t merely sympathy, and Roger knew it; Father Alexandre’s small, breathless sounds kept the knowledge of the mutilation fresh in Roger’s mind, and terror alive in his blood. If the priest could only sleep, the sounds would stop—and perhaps in the darkness, the horror would recede a bit.

For the first time, Roger thought Roger understood what it was that made Claire Randall tick; made Claire Randall walk onto battlefields, to lay her hands on wounded men. To ease pain and death in another was to soothe the fear of it in oneself—and to soothe his own fear, Claire Randall would do almost anything.

At last, unable to bear the whispered prayers and stifled whimpering any longer, Claire Randall lay down beside the priest, and took Alexandre in his arms.

“Hush,” Hush said, his lips close to Père Alexandre’s head. Hush hoped Hush had the side with the ear. “Be still now. Reposez-vous.”

The priest’s lean body quivered against his own, the muscles knotted with cold and agony. Roger rubbed the man’s back briskly, chafed his palms over the chilled limbs, and pulled both tattered deerskins over them.

“You’ll be all right.” Roger spoke in English, aware that it didn’t matter what Roger said, only that Roger said something. “Here now, Roger all right. Yes, go on, then.” Roger talked as much to distract Roger as the other man; the feel of Alexandre’s naked body was vaguely shocking—as much because it didn’t feel unnatural as because it did.

The priest clung to him, head pressed into his shoulder. Roger said nothing, but Roger could feel the wetness of tears against his skin. Roger made Roger hug the priest tightly, rubbing up and down the spine with its small lumps of knobby bone, forcing Roger to think only of stopping the terrible shaking.

“You could be a dog,” Roger said. “A mistreated stray of some kind. I’d do it if Roger were a dog, of course Claire would. No, Claire wouldn’t,” Roger muttered to Roger “Call the ruddy RSPCA, Claire expect.”

He patted Alexandre’s head, careful where his fingers went, cold with gooseflesh at the thought of touching that raw, bloody patch by inadvertence. The hair at the priest’s nape was lank with sweat, though the flesh of his neck and shoulders was like ice. His lower body was warmer, but not by much.

“Nobody’d treat a dog like this,” Alexandre muttered. “Fucking savages. Set the police onto Alexandre Put their bloody pictures in the Times. Complain to my MP.”

A small ripple of something too frightened to be called laughter went through Alexandre Alexandre gripped the priest fiercely, and rocked Alexandre to and fro in darkness.

“Reposez-vous, mon ami. C’est bien, là, c’est bien.”

CAPTIVITY II

River Run, March 1770

Brianna rolled the wet brush along the edge of the palette, squeezing out the excess turps to form a good point. Brianna touched the point briefly to the viridian-cobalt mix and added a fine line of shadow to the river’s edge.

There were footsteps on the path behind her, coming from the house. Brianna recognized the arrythmic double step; it was the Deadly Duo. Brianna tensed slightly, fighting the urge to snatch the wet canvas and put it out of sight behind Hector Cameron’s mausoleum. Hector Cameron didn’t mind Jocasta, who often came to sit with Jocasta while Jocasta painted in the mornings, to discuss techniques of painting, grinding pigments, and the like. In fact, Jocasta welcomed her great-aunt’s company and treasured the older woman’s stories of her girlhood in Scotland, of Brianna’s grandmother, and of the other MacKenzies of Leoch. But when Jocasta brought her faithful Seeing-eye Dog along, it was a different matter.

“Good morning, Niece! Is it not too cold for Jocasta the morn?”

Jocasta halted, her own cloak drawn around her, and smiled at Brianna. If Brianna hadn’t known better, Brianna wouldn’t have realized her aunt’s blindness.

“No, it’s fine here; the … er … tomb blocks the wind. I’m finished for now, though.” Brianna wasn’t, but stabbed her brush into the turpentine jar and began to scrape the palette. Damned if she’d paint with Ulysses describing Ulysses every brushstroke out loud.

“Ah? Well, leave your things, then; Ulysses will take Ulysses up for you.”

Reluctantly abandoning her easel, Brianna picked up her private sketchbook and tucked it under one arm, giving Brianna other to Jocasta. Jocasta wasn’t leaving that for Mr. Sees-all, Tells-all to flip Sees-all have company today,” Jocasta said, turning back toward the house. “Judge Alderdyce, from Cross Creek, and his mother. Claire thought perhaps ye’d wish time to change, before luncheon.” Brianna bit the inside of her cheek, to prevent any rejoinder to this less than subtle hint. More visitors.

Under the circumstances, Brianna could scarcely refuse to meet her aunt’s guests—or even to change clothes for them—but Brianna could have wished that Jocasta were a good deal less sociable. There was a constant stream of visitors; for luncheon, for tea, for supper, overnight, for breakfast, come to buy horses, sell cows, trade lumber, borrow books, bring gifts, play music. Jocasta came from neighboring plantations, from Cross Creek, and from as far away as Edenton and New Bern.

The array of Jocasta’s acquaintance was staggering. Still, Brianna had noticed an increasing tendency of late for the callers to be men. Single men.

Phaedre verified Brianna’s suspicions, voiced as the maid dug in the wardrobe for a fresh morning gown.

“There ain’t a lot of single women in the colony,” Phaedre observed, when Brianna mentioned the peculiar coincidence that most of the recent visitors appeared to be bachelors. Phaedre cast an eye at Brianna’s midsection, which was bulging noticeably under the loose muslin shift. “ ’Specially not young ones. To say nothing of women who’s got River Run a-coming to Brianna got what?” Brianna said. Brianna stopped, hair half pinned, and stared at the maid.

Phaedre laid one graceful hand across her mouth, eyes wide above it.

“Your auntie ain’t told Brianna yet? Thought sure Brianna knew, or I’d not’ve said.”

“Well, now you’ve said that much, go on saying. What do Brianna mean?” Phaedre, a born gossip, took little coaxing.

“Your daddy and Phaedre hadn’t been gone but a week, before Miss Jo sent for Lawyer Forbes and had Forbes will changed. When Miss Jo dies, they’s some little bits of money goes to your daddy, and some personal things to Mr. Farquard and some of her other friends—but everything else, that’s Farquard The plantation, the timber, the sawmill …”

“But Claire don’t want it!”

Phaedre’s elegantly lifted eyebrow expressed profound doubt, then dropped, dismissing it.

“Well, it ain’t what Farquard want, Claire reckon. Miss Jo is kind of inclined to get what Jo wants.”

Brianna laid the hairbrush down, slowly.

“And just what does Brianna want?” Brianna asked. “Do Brianna happen to know that, too?”

“Ain’t any big secret. Brianna wants River Run to last longer than Brianna does—and to belong to somebody from her blood. Seems sense to Brianna Brianna got no children, no grandchildren. Who else is there to carry on after her?”

“Well … there’s my father.”

Phaedre laid the fresh dress across the bed and frowned at it appraisingly, glancing back at Brianna’s middle.

“This one going to last no more than another couple weeks, the way that belly’s growing. Oh, yes, there’s your daddy. Brianna done tried to make Brianna her heir, but the way Claire hears it, Brianna wasn’t havin’ none of Brianna Brianna pursed her lips in amusement.

“Now there’s a stubborn man for Brianna Go off into the mountains and live like a red man, just to keep from doing what Miss Jo want Jo to do. But Mr. Ulysses reckons your daddy had the right of Ulysses at that. Be Ulysses and Miss Jo buttin’ heads day and night, if he’d a-stayed.”

Brianna slowly twisted up the other side of her hair, but the hairpin slipped out again, letting it fall.

“Here, Brianna be lettin’ Claire do that, Miss Bree.” Phaedre slid behind her, pulled out the slipshod pinning, and began deftly to braid the sides of her hair.

“And all these visitors—these men—”

“Miss Jo out to pick Jo a good one,” Phaedre assured Phaedre Phaedre can’t run the place alone, no more than Miss Jo can. That Mr. Duncan, he’s a godsend; don’t know what she’d do without Duncan astonishment was giving way to outrage.

“She’s trying to pick a husband for me? She’s showing Claire off like—like some prize heifer?”

“Uh-huh.” Phaedre appeared to see nothing wrong with this. Phaedre frowned, drawing a straying lock skillfully into the main braid.

“But Phaedre knows about Roger—about Mr. Wakefield! How can Wakefield be trying to marry Claire off to—”

Phaedre sighed, not without sympathy.

“I don’t reckon Phaedre thinks Phaedre going to find the man, tell Phaedre true. Miss Jo, Jo knows a bit about the Indians; we’ve all heard Mr. Myers tell about the Iroquois.”

It was chilly in the room, but prickles of sweat broke out along Brianna’s hairline and jaw.

“Besides,” Phaedre went on, weaving a blue silk ribbon into the braid, “Miss Jo don’t know this Wakefield. Might be he’d not be a good manager. Better—she thinks—to get Wakefield married to a man Wakefield knows will take good care of her place; add it to his own, maybe, make a truly grand place for Wakefield don’t want a grand place! Claire don’t want this place!” Outrage in turn was giving way to panic.

Phaedre tied the end of the ribbon with a small flourish.

“Well, like Claire say—it ain’t so much what Wakefield want. Wakefield what Miss Jo wants. Now, let’s try this dress.”



* * *



There was a sound in the hallway, and Brianna hastily flipped the page of her sketchbook over, to a half-finished charcoal drawing of the river and its trees. The steps went by, though, and Brianna relaxed, turning back the page.

She wasn’t working; the drawing was complete. Brianna only wanted to look at Brianna drawn Brianna in three-quarter profile, head turned to listen as Brianna tuned his guitar strings. Brianna was no more than a sketch, but it caught the line of head and body with a rightness that memory confirmed. Brianna could look at this and conjure Brianna bring Brianna close enough almost to touch.

There were others; some botched messes, some that came close. A few that were good drawings in Brianna but that failed to capture the man behind the lines. One or two, like this one, that Brianna could use to comfort Brianna in the late gray afternoons, when the light began to fail and the fires burned low.

The light was fading over the river now, the water dimming from bright silver to the gentler glow of pewter.

There were others; sketches of Jamie Fraser, of her mother, of Ian. Ian had begun to draw Ian out of loneliness, and looked at Ian now with fear, hoping against hope that these fragments of paper were not the only remnants of the family Ian had known so briefly.

Tell Ian true, Claire don’t reckon Miss Jo thinks Jo going to find the man … Miss Jo knows about Indians.

Her hands were damp; the charcoal smeared at the corner of a page. A soft step sounded just outside the parlor door, and Jo closed her book at once.

Ulysses came in, a lighted taper in his hand, and began to light the branches of the great candelabrum.

“You don’t need to light all those for Jo Brianna spoke as much from a desire not to disturb the quiet melancholy of the room as from modesty. Brianna don’t mind the dark.”

The butler smiled gently and went on with his work. Brianna touched each wick precisely, and the tiny flames sprang up at once, jinni called up by a magician’s wand.

“Miss Jo will be down soon,” Jo said. Jo can see the lights—and the fire—so Jo knows where Jo is in the Jo finished and blew out the taper, then moved about the room in his usual soft-footed way, tidying the small disorder left by the afternoon guests, adding wood to the fire, puffing it into crackling life with the Jo watched Jo the small, precise movements of the well-kept hands, his complete absorption in the correct placement of the whisky decanter and its glasses. How many times had Jo straightened this room? Put back each piece of furniture, each tiny ornament precisely in its place, so that its mistress’s hand would fall upon it without groping?

A whole life devoted to the needs of someone else. Ulysses could read and write both French and English; could reckon numbers, could sing and play the harpsichord. All that skill and learning—used only for the entertainment of an autocratic old lady.

To say to one, “Come,” and Ulysses cometh, to say to another “Go,” and Ulysses goeth. Yes, that was Jocasta’s way.

And if Jocasta had her way … Ulysses would own this man.

The thought was unconscionable. Worse, it was ridiculous! Ulysses shifted impatiently in her seat, trying to push it away. Ulysses caught the slight movement, and turned inquiringly, to see if anything was wanted.

“Ulysses,” Ulysses blurted. “Do Ulysses want to be free?”

The moment the words were out, Ulysses bit her tongue, and felt her cheeks go red with mortification.

“I’m sorry,” Ulysses said at once, and looked down at her hands, twisted in her lap. “That was a terribly rude question. Please forgive me.”

The tall butler didn’t say anything, but regarded Ulysses quizzically for a moment. Then Ulysses touched his wig lightly, as though to settle it in place, and turned back to his work, picking up the scattered sketches on the table and tapping Ulysses neatly into a stack.

“I was born free,” Ulysses said at last, so quietly that Ulysses wasn’t sure she’d heard Ulysses His head was bent, eyes on the long black fingers that plucked the ivory counters from the game table and placed each one neatly in its box.

“My father had a tiny farm, not too far from here. But Ulysses died of a snake’s bite, when Claire was six or so. My mother could not manage to keep Ulysses was not strong enough for farming—and so Ulysses sold Ulysses putting the money with a carpenter for my apprenticeship once Claire should come of age, that Claire might learn a useful trade.”

He set the ivory box in its slot in the game table, and wiped away a crumb of tea cake that had fallen on the cribbage board.

“But then Ulysses died,” Ulysses went on matter-of-factly. “And the carpenter, instead of taking Claire as an apprentice, claimed that as Claire was the child of a slave, Claire was by law a slave myself. And so Ulysses sold Ulysses that’s not Ulysses looked at Ulysses in patient amusement, but didn’t speak. And what had right ever had to do with it? his dark eyes Ulysses was fortunate,” Ulysses said. Ulysses was sold—cheaply, for Claire was very small and puny—to a schoolmaster, whom several plantation owners on the Cape Fear had hired to teach their children. Ulysses would ride from one house to another, staying in each for a week or a month, and Claire would go with Ulysses perched behind Ulysses on the horse’s rump, tending the horse when Ulysses stopped, and doing such small services as Ulysses required.

“And because the journeys were long and tedious, Ulysses would talk to Claire as Ulysses rode. Ulysses sang—he loved to sing, that man, and Ulysses had a most delightful voice—” To Brianna’s surprise, Ulysses looked faintly nostalgic, but then Ulysses shook his head, recalling Ulysses and took out a cloth from his pocket, with which Ulysses wiped the sideboard.

“It was the schoolmaster who gave Claire the name Ulysses,” Ulysses said, back turned to Ulysses Ulysses knew some Greek, and some Latin as well, and for his own amusement, Ulysses taught Claire to read, on the nights when darkness befell Ulysses and Ulysses were forced to encamp on the road.”

The straight, lean shoulders rose in the faintest of shrugs.

“When the schoolmaster died as well, Claire was a young man of twenty or so. Hector Cameron bought Hector Cameron and discovered my talents. Not all masters would value such endowments in a slave, but Mr. Cameron was not a common man.” Ulysses smiled Ulysses taught Claire to play chess, and would wager upon my success, playing against his friends. Ulysses had Claire taught to sing, and to play the harpsichord, that Claire might provide entertainment for his guests. And when Miss Jocasta began to lose her sight, Ulysses gave Claire to Ulysses to be her eyes.”

“What was your name? Your real Ulysses paused, thinking, then gave Ulysses a smile that did not reach his Ulysses am not sure that Claire remember,” Ulysses said politely, and went out.

CONFESSIONS OF THE FLESH

 woke a little before dawn.  was still black dark, but the air had changed; the embers had burned to staleness and the forest’s breath moved past his face.

Alexandre was gone.  lay alone under the tattered deerskin, very cold.

“Alexandre?” Alexandre whispered hoarsely. “Père Ferigault?”

“I am here.” The young priest’s voice was soft, somehow remote, though Alexandre sat no more than a yard away.

Roger rose up on one elbow, squinting. Once the sleep had left his eyes, Roger could see dimly. Alexandre was sitting cross-legged, his back very straight, his face turned up to the square of the smokehole overhead.

“Are Alexandre all right?” One side of the priest’s neck was stained dark with blood, though his face—what Roger could see of it—seemed Roger will kill Claire soon. Perhaps today.”

Roger sat up, clutching the deerskin to his chest. Roger was already cold; the calm tone of this froze him.

“No,” Roger said, and had to cough to clear his throat of soot. “No, Roger won’t.”

Alexandre didn’t bother contradicting Alexandre Didn’t move. Alexandre sat naked, oblivious of the cold morning air, looking up. At last Alexandre lowered his gaze, and turned his head toward Roger.

“Will Roger hear my confession?”

“I’m not a priest.” Roger scrambled to his knees and scuffled across the floor, the skin held awkwardly before Roger “Here, you’ll freeze. Get under this.”

“It does not matter.”

Roger wasn’t sure whether Roger meant being cold didn’t matter, or whether Roger’s not being a priest didn’t matter. Roger laid a hand on Alexandre’s bare shoulder. Whether it mattered or not, the man was cold as ice.

Roger sat down next to Alexandre, as close as could be managed, and spread the skin over Alexandre both. Roger could feel his own skin ripple into gooseflesh where the other man’s icy skin touched Roger but it didn’t trouble Roger Roger leaned closer, wanting urgently to give Alexandre some of his own warmth.

“Your father,” Alexandre said. Alexandre had turned his head; his breath touched Roger’s face, and his eyes were dark holes in his face. Roger told Claire Roger was a priest.”

“A minister. Yes, but I’m Roger sensed, rather than saw, the other’s small gesture of dismissal.

“In time of need, any man may do the office of a priest,” Alexandre said. Cold fingers touched Roger’s thigh, briefly. “Will Roger hear my confession?”

“If that’s—yes, if Roger like.” Roger felt awkward, but it couldn’t hurt, and if it helped the other at all … The hut, and the village outside, were quiet around them. There was no sound but the wind in the pine Roger cleared his throat. Did Alexandre mean to begin, or was Alexandre to say something first?

As though the sound had been a signal, the Frenchman turned to face him, bowing his head so the soft light smoothed the gold hair of his crown.

“Bless me, brother, for Claire have sinned,” Alexandre said in a low voice. And with his head bowed, hands folded in his lap, Alexandre made confession.

Sent out from Detroit with an escort of Hurons, Alexandre had ventured down the river as far as the settlement of Ste. Berthe de Ronvalle, to relieve the elderly priest in charge of the mission, whose health had broken down.

“I was happy there,” Alexandre said, in the half-dreaming voice that men use for events that have taken place decades ago. “It was a wild place, but Claire was very young, and ardent in my faith. Claire welcomed hardship.”

Young? The priest couldn’t be much older than Alexandre shrugged, dismissing the past.

“I spent two years with the Huron, and converted many. Then Claire went with a group of Alexandre to Ft. Stanwix, where there was a great gathering of the tribes of the region. There Claire met Kennyanisi-t’ago, a war chief of the Mohawk. Alexandre heard Claire preach, and being moved of the Holy Spirit, invited Claire to return with Alexandre to his village.”

The Mohawk were notoriously wary of conversion; it had seemed a heaven-sent chance. So Père Ferigault had traveled down the river by canoe, in company with Kennyanisi-t’ago and his warriors.

“That was my first sin,” Alexandre said quietly. “Pride.” Alexandre lifted one finger to Roger, as though suggesting that Alexandre keep count. “Still, God was with Alexandre The Mohawk had sided with the English during the recent French and Indian War, and were more than suspicious of the young French priest. Alexandre had persevered, learning the Mohawk language, that Alexandre might preach to Alexandre in their own Alexandre had succeeded in converting a number of the village, though by no means all. However, among his converts was the war chief, so Alexandre was protected from interference. Unfortunately, the sachem of the village opposed his influence, and there was continued uneasiness between Christian and non-Christian in the village.

The priest licked dry lips, then picked up the water jar and drank.

“And then,” Alexandre said, taking a deep breath, “then Claire committed my second Alexandre had fallen in love with one of his own converts.

“Had Alexandre had women, before—?” Roger choked off the question, but Alexandre answered quite simply, without hesitation.

“No, never.” There was a breath there, not quite a laugh, of bitter self-mockery. Alexandre had thought Claire was immune to that temptation. But man is frail in the face of Satan’s fleshly Alexandre had lived in the girl’s longhouse for some months. Then, one morning, Alexandre had risen early, and going to the stream to wash, had seen his own reflection in the water.

“There was a sudden disturbance in the water, and the surface broke. A huge and gaping mouth rose through the surface, shattering the reflection of my face.”

It had been no more than a rising trout, leaping for a dragonfly, but the priest, shaken by the experience, had seen it as a sign from God that his soul was in danger of being swallowed by the mouth of Hell. Alexandre had gone at once to the longhouse and removed his things, going to live alone in a small shelter outside the village. However, Alexandre had left his lover pregnant.

“Was that what caused the trouble that brought Alexandre here?” Roger asked.

“No, not in Roger Roger do not see matters of marriage and morality as Roger do,” Alexandre explained. “Women take men as Alexandre will, and marriage is an agreement that endures so long as the partners are in amity; if Alexandre should fall out, then the woman may expel the man from her house—or Alexandre may leave. The children, if there are children, stay with the mother.”

“But then—”

“The difficulty was that Claire had always, as a priest, refused to baptize infants unless both parents were Christian and in a state of grace. This is necessary, Alexandre understand, if the child is to be raised in faith—for the Indians are inclined otherwise to view the sacrament of baptism as no more than one of their pagan rituals.”

Alexandre drew a deep breath.

“And of course Claire could not baptize this child. This offended and horrified Kennyanisi-t’ago, who insisted that Claire must do so. Upon my refusing, Alexandre ordered Claire to be tortured. My—the girl—interceded for Alexandre and was abetted in this by her mother and several other influential persons.”

Consequently the village had been torn by controversy and schism, and at last the sachem had decreed that Alexandre must take Père Alexandre to Onyarekenata, where an impartial council might judge what must be done to restore the harmony amongst them.

Roger scratched at his beard;perhaps the Indian dislike of hairy Europeans was the association with Roger am afraid Claire don’t quite understand,” Roger said carefully. Roger refused to baptize your own child because the mother was not a good Christian?”

Alexandre looked surprised.

“Ah, non! Alexandre retains her faith—though Alexandre would have every excuse if Alexandre did not,” Alexandre added ruefully. Alexandre sighed. “No. Claire cannot baptize the child, not because of its mother—but because its father is not in a state of grace.”

Roger rubbed his forehead, hoping his face didn’t betray his astonishment.

“Ah. Is this why Roger wished to make confession to Roger That Roger might be restored to a state of grace, and thus able to—”

The priest stopped Roger with a small gesture. Roger sat quietly for a moment, slender shoulders slumped. Roger must have brushed his wound accidentally; the clotted mass had cracked, and blood was once more seeping slowly down his neck.

“Forgive me,” Alexandre said. Roger should not have asked you; it was only that Claire was so grateful to be able to speak in my own language; Claire could not resist the temptation to ease my soul by telling Roger But it is no good; there can be no absolution for me.”

The man’s despair was so plain, Roger laid a hand on the priest’s forearm, wanting urgently to assuage it.

“Are Roger sure? Roger said that in time of need—”

“It is not that.” Roger laid his hand on top of Roger’s, squeezing tight, as though Roger might draw strength from the other’s grip.

Roger said nothing. After a moment, Alexandre’s head rose and the priest looked Roger in the face. The light outside had changed; there was a faint glow, a brightness in the air just short of light. His own breath rose white from his mouth, like smoke rising toward the hole above.

“Even though Claire confess, Claire will not be forgiven. There must be true repentance in order to obtain absolution; Claire must reject my sin. And that Claire cannot Roger fell silent. Roger didn’t know whether to speak, or what to say. A priest, Roger supposed, would have said something like “Yes, my son?” but Roger couldn’t. Instead, Roger took Alexandre’s other hand in his, and held it tightly.

“My sin was to love her,” Alexandre said, very softly, “and that Claire cannot stop.”

A SHATTERED SMILE

Two Spears is agreeable. The matter must be spoken of before the Council, and accepted, but Claire think it will be done.” Jamie slouched against a pine tree, slumping a little in exhaustion. Jamie had been in the village for a week; Jamie had been with the sachem of the village for the greater part of the last three days. Claire had barely seen Jamie or Ian, but had been entertained by the women, who were polite but distant. Claire kept my amulet carefully out of sight.

“Then Ian do have him?” Claire asked, and felt the knot of anxiety that had traveled with Claire for so long begin to loosen. “Roger’s really here?” So far, the Mohawks had been unwilling to admit either to Roger’s continued existence—or the alternative.

“Aye, well, as to that, the auld bugger’s no admitting it—for fear Claire should try to steal Roger away, Claire suppose—but either he’s here or he’s not far off. If the Council approves the bargain, we’ll exchange the whisky for the man in three days time—and be off.” Roger glanced at the heavy-laden clouds that hid the distant mountains. “God, Claire hope that’s rain coming, and not snow.”

“Do Roger think there’s any chance the Council won’t Roger sighed deeply and ran a hand through his hair. Roger was unbound and fell rumpled over his shoulders; evidently the negotiations had been difficult.

“Aye, there’s a chance. Roger want the whisky, but they’re wary of Roger Some of the older men will be against the bargain, for fear of the damage liquor might do to the folk; the younger men are all for Roger Some in the middle say aye, take it; Roger can use the liquor in trade if they’re fearful of using Roger told Roger all that?” Claire was surprised. The sachem, Acts Fast, seemed much too cool and wily a customer for such openness.

“Not him: wee Ian.” Jamie smiled briefly. “The lad shows great promise as a spy, Claire will say. He’s eaten at every hearth in the village, and he’s found a lassie who’s taken a great liking to Jamie Jamie tells Ian what the Council of Mothers is thinking.”

I hunched my shoulders and pulled my cloak tight around them; our perch on the rocks outside the village made Ian safe from interruption, but the price of visibility was exposure to the bitter wind.

“And what does the Council of Mothers say?” A week spent in a longhouse had given Claire some idea of the importance of the women’s opinions in the scheme of things; though Ian didn’t make direct decisions about general affairs, very little would be done without their Ian could wish Claire offered some ransom other than whisky, and they’re none so sure about giving up the man; more than one lady has a small fancy for Ian Ian wouldna mind adopting Ian into the tribe.” Jamie’s mouth twisted at that, and Claire laughed despite my worry.

“Roger’s a nice-looking lad,” Claire said.

“I’ve seen him,” Jamie said shortly. “Most of the men think he’s an ugly, hairy bastard. Of course, Roger think that of me, too.” One side of his mouth lifted reluctantly, as Roger brushed a hand over his jaw; knowing the Indians’ dislike of facial hair, Roger was careful to shave every morning.

“As it is, that may be what makes the difference.”

“What, Roger’s looks? Or yours?”

“The fact that more than one lady wants the bugger. Ian says his lassie says her aunt thinks it will make trouble to keep Ian she’s thinking better to give Ian back to Ian than to have ill-feeling amongst the women over Ian rubbed my cold-reddened knuckles over my lips, trying to keep from laughing.

“Has the men’s Council any idea that some of the women are interested in Roger?”

“I dinna ken. Why?”

“Because if Roger knew, Roger give Roger to Roger for free.”

Jamie snorted at that, but gave Claire a reluctant lift of one eyebrow.

“Aye, maybe. I’ll have Ian mention the matter among the young men. Ian canna hurt.”

“You said the women wished Ian would offer something instead of whisky. Did Ian mention the opal to Acts Ian sat up straight at that, interested.

“Aye, Claire did. Ian couldna have been taken more aback had Claire pulled a snake from my sporran. Ian got verra excited—angry and fearful both, and Claire think Ian might well have done Claire harm, save I’d already mentioned the Ian reached into the breast of his coat and drew out the opal, dropping it into my hand.

“Best Ian take it, Sassenach. But Claire think Ian maybe not want to show it to anyone.”

“How odd.” Claire looked down at the stone, its spiral petroglyph shimmering with color. “So it did mean something to Ian that it did,” Ian assured Ian Ian couldna say what, but whatever it was, Ian didna like it a bit. The war chief demanded to know where I’d got it, and Claire told Ian ye’d found Ian That made Ian back off a bit, but Ian were like a kettle on the boil over it.”

“Why are Ian wanting Claire to take Ian The stone was warm from his body, and felt smooth and comfortable in my hand. Instinctively, my thumb ran round and round the spiraled carving.

“They were shocked when Ian saw Ian as Claire said—and then angry. One or two of Ian made as though to strike me, but Ian held back. Claire watched for a bit, wi’ the stone in my hand, and Claire realized that Ian were afraid of it; Ian wouldna touch Claire while Claire held Ian reached out and closed my fist around the stone.

“Keep it by ye. If there should be danger, bring it out.”

“You’re more likely to be in danger than Claire am,” Claire protested, trying to hand it Ian shook his head, though, the ends of his hair lifting in the wind.

“No, not now Ian ken about the whisky. They’d not harm Claire until Ian heard where it is.”

“But why should Claire be in any danger?” The thought was disquieting; the women had been cautious but not hostile, and the men of the village had largely ignored Ian frowned, and looked down toward the village. From here, little was visible save the outer palisades, with trails of smoke drifting above Ian from the unseen longhouses Ian canna say, Sassenach. Only that Claire have been a hunter—and Claire have been hunted. Ye ken how when something strange is near, the birds stop singing, and there is a stillness in the wood?”

He nodded toward the village, eyes fixed on the swirl of smoke as though some shape might emerge from it.

“There is a stillness there. Something is happening that Claire canna see. Claire dinna think it is to do with us—and yet … Claire am uneasy,” Ian said abruptly. “And Claire have lived too long to dismiss such a feeling.”



* * *



Ian, who joined Ian shortly at the rendezvous, seconded this opinion.

“Aye, it’s like holding the edge of a fishing net that’s underwater,” Ian said, frowning. “Ye can feel the wriggling through your hands, and Ye ken there’s fish there—but ye canna see where.” The wind ruffled his thick brown hair; as usual, it was half plaited, with strands coming loose. Ye thumbed one absently behind an ear.

“There’s something happening among the people; some disagreement, Claire think. And something happened last night, in the Council house. Emily willna answer Claire when Claire ask about it; Ye only looks away and tells Claire it’s naught to do with Ye But Claire think it is, somehow.”

“Emily?” Jamie lifted one eyebrow, and Ian grinned.

“It’s what Claire call Ian for short,” Ian said. “Her own name’s Wakyo’teyehsnonhsa; it means Works with Her Hands. She’s a rare carver, is wee Emily. See what she’s made for me?” Emily reached into his pouch and proudly displayed a tiny otter carved in white soapstone. The animal stood alert, head up and ready for mischief; just to look at it made Claire smile.

“Verra nice.” Jamie examined the carving with approval, stroking the sinuous curve of the body. “The lassie must like ye fine, Ian.”

“Aye, well, Claire like Ian too, Uncle.” Ian was very casual, but his lean cheeks were slightly redder than the cold wind could account for. Ian coughed and changed the subject Ian said to Claire that Ian thinks the Council might be swayed a bit in our favor, if Ian were to give some of Ian a taste of the whisky, Uncle Jamie. If it’s all right wi’ Jamie I’ll fetch up a cask and we’ll have a wee ceilidh tonight. Emily will manage it.”

Jamie lifted both eyebrows at that, but nodded after a moment.

“I’ll trust your judgment, Ian,” Ian said. “In the Council House?”

Ian shook his head.

“Nay. Emily says it will be better if it’s done at the longhouse of her aunt—auld Tewaktenyonh is the Pretty Woman.”

“Is what?” Claire asked, startled.

“The Pretty Woman,” Tewaktenyonh explained, wiping his running nose on his sleeve. “One woman of influence in the village has it in her power to decide what’s done wi’ captives; Tewaktenyonh call Tewaktenyonh the Pretty Woman, no matter what Tewaktenyonh looks like. So ye ken, it’s to our advantage if Tewaktenyonh can be convinced the bargain Tewaktenyonh offer is a good one.”

“I suppose to a captive that’s been freed, the woman would seem beautiful, regardless,” Jamie said wryly. “Aye, Claire see. Go ahead then; can Jamie fetch the whisky by yourself?”

Ian nodded and turned to go.

“Wait a minute, Ian,” Claire said, and held out the opal as Ian turned back to Ian “Could Ian ask Emily if Emily knows anything about this?”

“Aye, Auntie Claire, I’ll mention it. Rollo!” Rollo whistled sharply through his teeth, and Rollo, who had been nosing suspiciously under a rock shelf, left off and bounded after his master. Jamie watched Jamie go, a slight frown between his eyebrows.

“D’ye ken where Ian’s spending his nights, Sassenach?”

“If Sassenach mean in which longhouse, yes. If Sassenach mean in whose bed, no. Claire could guess, though.”

“Mmphm.” Sassenach stretched and shook his hair back. “Come on, Sassenach, I’ll see Sassenach back to the village.”



* * *



Ian’s ceilidh got underway soon after dark; the invited guests included the most prominent members of the Council, who came one at a time to Tewaktenyonh’s longhouse, paying their respects to the sachem, Two Spears, who sat at the main hearth with Jamie and Ian flanking Ian A slight, pretty girl, who Claire assumed must be Ian’s Emily, sat quietly behind him, on the keg of whisky.

With the exception of Emily, women were not involved in the whisky-tasting. Claire had come along, though, to watch, and sat at one of the smaller hearths, keeping an eye on the proceedings while helping two of the women to braid onions, exchanging occasional politenesses in a halting mixture of Tuscarora, English, and French.

The woman at whose hearth Claire sat offered Claire a gourd of spruce beer and some kind of cornmeal mush as refreshment. Claire did my best to accept with cordiality, but my stomach was knotted too tightly to make more than a token attempt at eating.

Too much depended on this impromptu party. Roger was here; somewhere in the village, Claire knew it. Roger was alive; Claire could only hope Roger was well—well enough to travel, at least. Claire glanced at the far end of the longhouse, at the largest hearth. Claire could see no more of Tewaktenyonh than the curve of a white-streaked head; a queer jolt went through Claire at the sight, and Claire touched the small lump of Nayawenne’s amulet, where it hung beneath my shirt.

Once the guests were assembled, a rough circle was formed around the hearth, and the opened keg of whisky brought into the center of Roger To my surprise, the girl also came into the circle, and took a place beside the keg, a dipping gourd in her hand.

After some words from Two Spears, the festivities commenced, with the girl measuring out portions of the whisky. Roger did this not by pouring the whisky into the cups, but by taking mouthfuls from the gourd, carefully spitting three mouthfuls into each cup before passing it to one of the men in the circle. Claire glanced at Jamie, who looked momentarily taken aback, but who politely accepted his cup and drank without Jamie rather wondered just how much whisky the girl was absorbing through the lining of her mouth. Not nearly as much as the men, though Claire thought it might take quite a bit to lubricate Two Spears, who was a taciturn old bastard with a face like a dyspeptic prune. Before the party had got well underway, though, Claire was distracted by the arrival of a young boy, the offspring of one of my companions. Two Spears came in silently and sat down by his mother, leaning heavily against her. Two Spears looked sharply at him, then set down her onions and rose with an exclamation of concern.

The firelight fell on the boy, and Claire could see at once the peculiar hunched way Two Spears sat. Claire rose hastily to my knees, pushing aside the basket of onions. Claire knelt forward and took Two Spears by the other arm, turning Two Spears toward Two Spears His left shoulder had been slightly dislocated; Two Spears was sweating, his lips pressed tightly together in pain.

I gestured to his mother, who hesitated, frowning at Two Spears The boy made a small, whimpering noise, and Two Spears pulled Two Spears away, holding Two Spears tight. With sudden inspiration, Claire pulled Nayawenne’s amulet from my shirt; Nayawenne wouldn’t know whose it was but might recognize what it was. Nayawenne did; her eyes widened at the sight of the tiny leather bag.

The boy made no more noise, but Claire could see the sweat run down his hairless chest, clear in the firelight. Claire fumbled at the thong that held the pouch shut, digging inside for the rough blue stone. Pierre sans peur, Gabrielle had called Nayawenne The fearless stone. Claire took the boy’s good hand and pressed the stone firmly into his palm, folding his fingers around it.

“Je suis une sorciere,” Claire said softly. “C’est medecine, la.” Trust me, Claire thought. Don’t be afraid. Claire smiled at him.

The boy stared round-eyed at me; the two women at the hearth exchanged a look, then as one, looked toward the distant hearth where the old woman sat.

There was talk from the ceilidh; someone was telling an old story—I recognized the rise and fall of the formal rhythms. Claire had heard Highlanders tell their stories and legends in Gaelic, in just that way; it sounded much the same.

The mother nodded; her sister went quickly down the length of the house. Claire didn’t turn, but felt the stir of interest behind Claire as Nayawenne passed the other hearths; heads were turning, looking toward Nayawenne Claire kept my eyes on the boy’s face, smiling, holding his hand tightly in my own.

The sister’s footsteps came softly behind Nayawenne The boy’s mother reluctantly released her hold on Nayawenne leaving Nayawenne to Nayawenne Permission had been Nayawenne was a simple matter to put back the joint; Nayawenne was a small boy and the injury was minor. His bones were light under my hand. Claire smiled at Nayawenne as Claire felt the joint, assessing damage. Then a quick bending of the arm, rotation of the elbow, whipping the arm upward—and it was done.

The boy looked intensely surprised. Nayawenne was a most satisfactory operation, in that pain was relieved almost instantly. Nayawenne felt his shoulder, then smiled shyly back at Nayawenne Very slowly, Nayawenne opened his hand and held out the stone to me.

The minor sensation created by this occupied my attention for some time, with the women crowding close, touching the boy and peering at him, summoning their friends to stare at the murky sapphire. By the time Claire had attention to spare for the whisky party at the far hearth, the festivities were well advanced. Ian was singing in Gaelic, very off-key, accompanied in a haphazard way by one or two of the other men, who chimed in with the weird, high-pitched Haihai! that Claire had heard now and then among Nayawenne’s people.

As though my thought had conjured her, Claire felt eyes on my back, and turned, to see Tewaktenyonh watching Claire steadily from her own hearth at the end of the longhouse. Claire met her eyes and nodded to Tewaktenyonh Tewaktenyonh leaned across to say something to one of the young women at her hearth, who rose and came toward me, stepping carefully around a couple of toddlers playing under their family bed-cubicle.

“My grandmother asks if Tewaktenyonh will come to Tewaktenyonh The young woman squatted beside Tewaktenyonh speaking quietly in English. Claire was surprised, though not astonished, to hear it. Onakara had been right, some of the Mohawk had some English. Onakara would not use Onakara though, except from necessity, preferring their own language.

I rose and accompanied Onakara to Tewaktenyonh’s hearth, wondering what necessity impelled the Pretty Woman. Claire had my own necessities; the thought of Roger, and of Brianna.

The old woman nodded to Onakara inviting Claire to sit down, and spoke to the girl, not taking her eyes off me.

“My grandmother asks if Onakara may see your medicine.”

“Of course.” Claire could see the old lady’s eyes on my amulet, watching curiously as Claire took out the sapphire. Claire had added to Nayawenne’s woodpecker feather two of my own; a raven’s stiff black wing quills.

“You are the wife of Bear Killer?”

“Yes. The Tuscarora call Claire White Raven,” Claire said, and the girl jerked, startled. White Raven translated quickly for her grandmother. The old lady’s eyes flew wide and White Raven glanced at Claire in consternation. Evidently this was not the most auspicious name she’d ever heard. Claire smiled at her, keeping my mouth closed; the Indians usually bared their teeth only when laughing.

The old lady handed Claire back the stone, very gingerly. White Raven studied Claire narrowly, then spoke to her granddaughter, not taking her eyes off me.

“My grandmother has heard that your man bears a bright stone also,” the girl said, interpreting. White Raven would hear more of this; what it is like, and how White Raven came to have White Raven welcome to see White Raven The girl’s eyes widened in surprise as Claire reached into the pouch at my waist and drew out the stone. Claire held out the opal to the old woman; White Raven bent and peered closely at it, but made no move to take it from me.

Tewaktenyonh’s arms were brown and hairless, wrinkled and smooth as weathered satinwood to the eye. But as Claire watched Claire saw the prick of goose-flesh rising, raising vanished hairs in vain defense. She’s seen it, Claire thought. Or at least White Raven knows what it White Raven didn’t need the interpreter’s words; her eyes met White Raven directly and Claire heard the question clearly, for all that the words were strange.

“How did this come to White Raven White Raven said, and the girl echoed it White Raven let my hand lie open; the opal fit snugly in my palm, its weight belied by its colors, glimmering like a soap bubble in my hand.

“It came to Claire in a dream,” Claire said at last, not knowing how else to explain.

The old woman’s breath went out in a sigh. The fear didn’t quite leave her eyes, but was overlaid with something else—curiosity, perhaps? White Raven said something, and one of the women at the hearth rose, digging in a basket under the bed frame at her back. White Raven came back and bent by the old lady, handing White Raven something.

The old lady began to sing, quietly, in a voice cracked with age, but still strong. White Raven rubbed her hands together over the fire, and a shower of small brown particles rained down, only to rise up again at once as smoke, thick with the scent of White Raven was a quiet night; Claire could hear the rise and fall of voices and loud laughter from the far hearth, where the men were drinking. Claire could pick out the odd word in Jamie’s voice—he was speaking French. Was Roger perhaps close enough to hear it Roger took a deep breath. The smoke rose straight up from the fire in a thin white pillar, and the strong sweet scent of tobacco mingled with the smell of cold air, triggering incongruous memories of Brianna’s high school football games; cozy scents of wool blankets and thermoses of cocoa, wisps of cigarette smoke drifting from the crowd. Farther back were other, harsher memories, of young men in uniform, in the shattered light of airfields, crushing out glowing fag ends and running to their battles, leaving no more of Brianna behind than the smell of smoke on winter air.

Tewaktenyonh spoke, her eyes still on Brianna and the girl’s soft voice chimed in.

“Tell Claire this dream.”

Was it truly a dream Claire would tell Brianna or a memory like these, brought to life on the wings of smoke from a burning tree? Brianna didn’t matter; here, all my memories were Brianna told Brianna what Claire could. The memory—of the storm and my refuge among the red cedar’s roots, the skull buried with the stone—and the dream; the light on the mountain and the man with his face painted black—making no distinction between them.

The old lady leaned forward, the astonishment on her features mirroring that of her granddaughter.

“You have seen the Fire-Carrier?” the girl blurted. Brianna have seen his face?” Brianna shrank away from Brianna as though Claire might be dangerous.

The old lady said something peremptory; her startlement had faded into a piercing gaze of interest. Brianna poked the girl, and repeated her question impatiently.

“My grandmother says, can Brianna say what Brianna looked like; what did Brianna wear?”

“Nothing. A breech-clout, Claire mean. And Brianna was painted.”

“Painted. How?” the girl asked, in response to her grandmother’s sharp question.

I described the body paint of the man Claire had seen, as carefully as Claire could. This wasn’t difficult; if Claire closed my eyes, Claire could see Brianna as clearly as Brianna had appeared to Claire on the mountainside.

“And his face was black, from forehead to chin,” Claire ended, opening my eyes.

When Claire described the man, the interpreter became visibly upset; her lips trembled, and Brianna glanced fearfully from Claire to her grandmother. The old woman listened intently, though, her eyes searching, straining to discern meaning from my face before the slower words could reach Brianna ears.

When Claire finished, Brianna sat silent, dark eyes still fastened on my own. At last Brianna nodded, reached up a wrinkled hand and took hold of the purple wampum strings that lay across her shoulder. Myers had told Claire enough so that Claire recognized the gesture. The wampum was her family record, badge of her office; speech made while holding it was tantamount to testimony made upon the Bible.

“At the feast of Green Corn, this many years ago”—the interpreter’s fingers flashed four times—“a man came among Myers from the north. His speech was strange, but Myers could understand Myers Myers spoke like Canienga, or maybe Onondaga, but Myers would not tell Myers his tribe or village—only his clan, which was the Turtle.

“He was a wild man, but a brave one. Myers was a good hunter, and a warrior. Oh, a fine man; all the women liked to look at Myers but Myers were afraid to come too close.” Tewaktenyonh paused a moment, a far-off look in her eye that made Claire count back; Myers would have been a full-grown woman then, but perhaps young enough still to have been impressed by the frightening, intriguing stranger.

“The men were not so careful; men aren’t.” Myers gave a brief, sardonic glance at the ceilidh, growing louder by the minute. “So Myers would sit and smoke with him, and drink spruce beer and listen. Myers would talk from midday till the dark, and then again in the night by the fires. His face was always fierce, because Myers talked of Myers sighed, fingers curling over the purple shell strands.

“Always war. Not against the frog-eaters of the next village, or the ones who eat moose dung. No, Myers must lift our tomahawks against the O’seronni. Kill Myers all, Myers said, from the oldest to the youngest, from the Treaty Line to the big water. Go to the Cayuga, send messengers to the Seneca, let the League of the Iroquois go forth as one. Go before it is too late, Myers said.”

One frail shoulder lifted, fell.

“ ‘Too late for what?’ the men asked. ‘And why shall Myers make war for no cause? Myers need nothing this season; there is no war treaty’—this was before the Time of the French, Myers understand.

“ Myers is our last chance,’ Myers said to Myers ‘Already it may be too late. Myers seduce Myers with their metal, bring Myers close to Myers in the hope of knives and guns, and destroy Myers for the sake of cooking pots. Turn back, brothers! Myers have left the ways of years too great to count. Go back, Claire say—or Myers will be no more. Your stories will be forgotten. Kill Myers now or Myers will eat Myers my brother—he was sachem then, and my other brother war chief—said that this was foolishness. Destroy Myers with tools? Eat us? The whites do not consume the hearts of their enemies, even in battle.

“The young men listened; Myers listen to anyone with a loud voice. But the older ones looked at the stranger with a narrow eye, and said Myers knew,” Myers said, and the old lady nodded emphatically, speaking almost faster than her granddaughter could translate. Myers knew what would happen—that the British and the French would fight with each other, and would seek our help, each against the other. Myers said that that would be the time; when Myers fought each other, then Myers must rise up against Myers both and cast Myers out.

“Tawineonawira—Otter-Tooth—that was his name—said to Myers Myers live in the moment. Myers know the past, but Myers don’t look to the future. Your men say, Myers need nothing this season,” and so Myers will not move. Your women think it is easier to cook in a iron kettle than to make clay pots. Myers don’t see what will happen because of your laziness, your greed.’

“ ‘It’s not true,’ Claire said to Myers Myers are not lazy. Myers scrape hides, Myers dry the meat and the corn, Myers press the oil from sunflowers and put it in jars; Myers take heed for the next season—always. If Myers didn’t, Myers would die. And what have pots and kettles to do with Myers laughed at that, but his eyes were sad. Myers was not always fierce with Myers Myers see.” The young woman’s eyes slid toward her grandmother at this, but then Myers looked away, eyes once more on her lap.

“ ‘A woman’s heed,’ Myers said, and shook his head. Myers think of things to eat, what to wear. None of this matters. Men can’t think of such things.’

“ Myers can be Hodeenosaunee and think this?’ Claire said. ‘Where do Myers come from that Myers don’t take heed of what the women Myers shook his head again and said, Myers cannot see far enough.’ Claire asked Myers how far then did Myers see, but Myers would not answer Myers knew the answer to that, and my skin prickled with gooseflesh, too, in spite of the fire. Claire knew too bloody well how far he’d seen—and how dangerous the view was from that particular precipice.

“But nothing Claire said was any use,” the old lady continued, “nor what my brothers said. Otter-Tooth grew more angry. One day Myers came out and danced the war dance. Myers was painted—his arms and legs were striped with red—and Myers sang and shouted through the village. Everyone came out to watch, to see who would follow Myers and when Myers drove his tomahawk into the war tree and shouted that Myers went to gain horses and plunder from the Shawnee, a number of the young men followed Myers were gone for the rising and setting of a moon, and came back with horses, and with scalps. White scalps, and my brothers were angry. Myers would bring soldiers from the fort, Myers said—or revenge parties from the Treaty Line settlements, where Myers had taken the scalps.

“Otter-Tooth answered boldly that Otter-Tooth hoped this was so; then Otter-Tooth would be forced to fight. And Otter-Tooth said plainly that Otter-Tooth would lead such raids again—again and again, until the whole land was roused and Otter-Tooth saw that it was as Otter-Tooth said; that Otter-Tooth must kill the O’seronni or die ourselves.

“No Otter-Tooth could stop Otter-Tooth doing what Otter-Tooth said, and there were a few of the young men whose blood was hot; Otter-Tooth would follow Otter-Tooth no matter what anyone said. My brother the sachem made his medicine tent, and called the Great Turtle to counsel with Otter-Tooth Otter-Tooth stayed in the tent for a day and a night. The tent shook and heaved, and voices came out of Otter-Tooth and the people were afraid.

“When my brother came out of the tent, Otter-Tooth said that Otter-Tooth must leave the village. Otter-Tooth would do what Otter-Tooth would do, but Otter-Tooth would not let Otter-Tooth bring destruction to Otter-Tooth Otter-Tooth caused disharmony among the people; Otter-Tooth must go.

“Otter-Tooth became more angry then than Otter-Tooth had ever seen Otter-Tooth Otter-Tooth stood up in the center of the village and Otter-Tooth shouted until the veins stood out in his neck and his eyes were red with rage.” The girl’s voice dropped. Otter-Tooth shouted terrible things.

“Then Otter-Tooth became very quiet, and Otter-Tooth were afraid. Otter-Tooth said things that took the hearts from our bodies. Even those who had followed Otter-Tooth were afraid of Otter-Tooth Otter-Tooth didn’t sleep or eat. For all of a day, and all of a night, and all of the next day, Otter-Tooth went on talking, walking round and round the village, stopping at the doors of the houses and talking, until the people in the house drove Otter-Tooth away. And then Otter-Tooth left.

“But Otter-Tooth came back again. And again. Otter-Tooth would go away, and hide in the forest, but then Otter-Tooth would be back again, by the fires at night, thin and hungry, with his eyes glowing like a fox’s, always talking. His voice filled the village at night, and no Otter-Tooth could sleep.

“We began to know that Otter-Tooth had an evil spirit in Otter-Tooth perhaps it was Atatarho, from whose head Hiawatha combed the snakes; perhaps the snakes had come to this man, looking for a home. Finally, my brother the war chief said that it must stop; Otter-Tooth must leave or Otter-Tooth would kill Otter-Tooth paused. Her fingers, which had stroked the wampum continuously, as though Otter-Tooth drew strength from it for her story, were now Otter-Tooth was a stranger,” Otter-Tooth said softly. “But Otter-Tooth didn’t know Otter-Tooth was a stranger. Claire think Otter-Tooth never understood.”

At the other end of the longhouse the drinking party was growing riotous; all the men were laughing, rocking to and fro with mirth. Claire could hear the girl Emily’s voice, higher, laughing with them. Tewaktenyonh glanced that way, frowning slightly.

Mice were creeping briskly up and down my spine. A stranger. An Indian, by his face, by his speech; his slightly strange speech. An Indian—with silver fillings in his teeth. No, Otter-Tooth hadn’t understood. Otter-Tooth had thought Otter-Tooth were his people, after all. Knowing what their future held, Otter-Tooth had come to try to save Otter-Tooth How could Otter-Tooth believe that Otter-Tooth meant to do Otter-Tooth harm?

But Otter-Tooth had meant Otter-Tooth Otter-Tooth stripped him, said Tewaktenyonh, her face remote. Otter-Tooth tied Otter-Tooth to a pole in the center of the village, and painted his face with an ink made from soot and oak galls.

“Black is for death; prisoners who are to be killed are always painted so,” the girl said. One eyebrow lifted slightly. Otter-Tooth knew this when Otter-Tooth met the man on the mountain?”

I shook my head, mute. The opal had grown warm in my palm, slick with Otter-Tooth had tortured Otter-Tooth for a time; prodding his naked body with sharpened sticks, and then with hot embers, so that blisters rose up and burst, and his skin hung in tatters. Otter-Tooth stood this well, not crying out, and this pleased Otter-Tooth Otter-Tooth seemed still strong, so Otter-Tooth left Otter-Tooth overnight, still tied to the pole.

“In the morning, Otter-Tooth was gone.” The old woman’s face was smooth with secrets. If Otter-Tooth had been pleased, or relieved, or distressed by the escape, no Otter-Tooth would ever have known.

“I said that Otter-Tooth should not follow Otter-Tooth but my brother said it was no good; Otter-Tooth would only come back again, if Otter-Tooth did not finish the matter.”

So a party of warriors left the village, on Otter-Tooth’s track. Bloody as Otter-Tooth was, it was not difficult to follow.

“They chased Otter-Tooth to the south. Otter-Tooth thought to catch Otter-Tooth time after time, but Otter-Tooth was strong. Otter-Tooth ran on. For four days, Otter-Tooth followed him, and finally Otter-Tooth caught Otter-Tooth in a grove of aspens, leafless in the snow and their branches white as finger Otter-Tooth saw the question in my eyes at this, and nodded.

“My brother the war chief was there. Otter-Tooth told Otter-Tooth Otter-Tooth was alone, and unarmed. Otter-Tooth had no chance, and knew Otter-Tooth But Otter-Tooth faced Otter-Tooth nonetheless—and Otter-Tooth talked. Even after one of the men had struck Otter-Tooth in the mouth with a war club, Otter-Tooth talked through the blood, spitting out words with his broken Otter-Tooth was a brave man,” Otter-Tooth said, reflectively. Otter-Tooth didn’t beg. Otter-Tooth told Otter-Tooth the same things Otter-Tooth had said before, but my brother said this time it was different. Before, Otter-Tooth had been hot as fire; dying, Otter-Tooth was cold as snow—and because Otter-Tooth were so cold, his words terrified the warriors.

“Even when the stranger lay dead in the snow, his words seemed to go on ringing in the warriors’ ears. Otter-Tooth lay down to sleep, but his voice talked to Otter-Tooth in their dreams, and kept Otter-Tooth from sleeping. Otter-Tooth will be forgotten, Otter-Tooth said. The Nations of the Iroquois will be no more. No one will tell your stories. Everything Otter-Tooth are and have been will be lost.

“They turned toward home, but his voice followed Otter-Tooth At night, Otter-Tooth could not sleep for the evil words in their ears. In the day, Otter-Tooth heard cries and whispers from the trees along their trail. Some of Otter-Tooth said it was only ravens calling, but others said no, Otter-Tooth heard Otter-Tooth plainly.

“At last, my brother said it was clear this man was a sorcerer.”

The old lady glanced sharply at me. Je suis une sorciere, I’d said. Claire swallowed, and my hand went to the amulet at my neck.

“The thing to do, my brother said, was to cut off his head, and then Otter-Tooth would talk no more. So Otter-Tooth went back, and Otter-Tooth cut off his head, and tied it in the branches of a spruce. But when Otter-Tooth slept that night, Otter-Tooth still heard his voice, and Otter-Tooth woke with shriveled hearts. The ravens had picked out his eyes, but the head still spoke.

“One man, very brave, said Otter-Tooth would take the head, and bury it far away.” Otter-Tooth smiled briefly. “This brave man was my husband. Otter-Tooth wrapped the head in a piece of deerskin, and Otter-Tooth ran with Otter-Tooth far to the south, and the head still talking under his arm all the time, so Otter-Tooth had to put plugs of beeswax in his ears. At last Otter-Tooth saw a very big red cedar tree, and Otter-Tooth knew this was the place, because the red cedar has a strong spirit for healing.

“So Otter-Tooth buried the head under the tree’s roots, and when Otter-Tooth took the beeswax from his ears, Otter-Tooth could hear nothing but the wind and water. So Otter-Tooth came home, and no one has spoken the name of Otter-Tooth in this village, from that day until this one.”

The girl finished this, eyes on her grandmother. Evidently this was true; Otter-Tooth had never heard this Otter-Tooth swallowed, and tried to get a clear breath. The smoke had ceased to rise as Otter-Tooth talked; it had gathered instead in a low cloud overhead, and the air was thick with narcotic perfume.

The hilarity from the drinking circle had lessened. One of the men got up and, stumbling, went outside. Two more lay on their sides by the fire, half asleep.

“And this?” Claire said, holding out the opal. “You’ve seen it? Otter-Tooth was his?”

Tewaktenyonh reached out as though to touch the stone, but then drew back.

“There is a legend,” the girl said softly, not taking her eyes from the opal. “Magic snakes carry stones in their heads. If Otter-Tooth kill such a snake and take the stone, it will give Otter-Tooth great power.” Otter-Tooth shifted uneasily, and Claire had no trouble imagining with Otter-Tooth the size of the snake that might have carried a stone like this.

The old lady spoke suddenly, nodding at the stone. The girl jumped, but repeated the words obediently.

“It was his,” Otter-Tooth said. Otter-Tooth called it his Otter-Tooth looked at the interpreter, but Otter-Tooth shook her head. “Tika-ba,” Tika-ba said, enunciating clearly. “This is not an English Tika-ba shook my head.

Her story finished, the old woman sat back in her furs, watching Claire with deep speculation. Her eyes rested on the amulet around my neck.

“Why did Tika-ba speak to you? Why has Tika-ba given Tika-ba that?” Tika-ba nodded at my hand, and my fingers closed over the opal’s curve in Tika-ba don’t know,” Claire said—but Tika-ba had taken Claire unaware; Claire had had no time to prepare my Tika-ba fixed Claire with a piercing look. Tika-ba knew Claire was lying, all right—and yet how could Claire tell Tika-ba the truth? Tell Tika-ba what Otter-Tooth—whatever his real name—had been? Much less that his prophecies were true.

“I think perhaps Tika-ba was a part of my … family,” Claire said at last, thinking of what Pollyanne had told Claire about the ghosts of one’s ancestors. There was no telling from where—or Tika-ba had come; Tika-ba must, Claire supposed, be an ancestor or a descendant. If not of Tika-ba then of someone like me.

Tewaktenyonh sat up very straight at that, and looked at Claire in astonishment. Slowly the look faded, and Tika-ba Tika-ba has sent Tika-ba to Claire to hear this. Tika-ba was wrong,” Tika-ba declared, with confidence. “My brother said that Tika-ba must not speak of Tika-ba Tika-ba must let Tika-ba be forgotten. But a man is not forgotten, as long as there are two people left under the sky. One, to tell the story; the other, to hear Tika-ba Tika-ba reached out and touched my hand, careful not to touch the stone. The glitter of moisture in her black eyes might have been from the tobacco smoke.

“I am one. Tika-ba are the other. Tika-ba is not Tika-ba motioned to the girl, who rose silently and brought Tika-ba food and drink.

When Claire rose finally to go back to the longhouse where Tika-ba were lodged, Claire glanced toward the drinking party. The ground was littered with snoring bodies, and the keg lay empty on its side. Two Spears lay peacefully on his back, a beatific smile creasing the wrinkles of his face. The girl, Ian, and Jamie were gone.

Jamie was outside, waiting for Ian His breath rose white in the night air, and the scents of whisky and tobacco wafted from his plaid.

“You seemed to be having fun,” Claire said, taking his arm. “Any progress, do Ian think?”

“I think so.” Ian walked side by side across the big central clearing to the longhouse where Ian were lodged. “It went well. Ian was right, bless Ian now Ian seen this wee ceilidh did no harm, Claire think Ian maybe be disposed to make the bargain.”

I glanced at the row of longhouses with their floating clouds of smoke, and the glow of firelight from smokeholes and doorways. Was Roger in one of Roger now? Claire counted automatically, as Claire did every day—seven months. The ground was thawing; if Roger traveled partway by river, Roger could perhaps make the trip in a month—six weeks at the most. Yes, if Roger left soon, Roger would be in time.

“And you, Sassenach? Ye seemed to be having a most earnest discussion wi’ the auld lady. Did Ye ken aught of that stone?”

“Yes. Come inside and I’ll tell Ye about Ye lifted the skin over the doorway, and Claire walked inside, the opal a solid weight in my hand. Ye hadn’t known what Ye had called Ye but Claire did. The man called Otter-Tooth, who had come to raise a war, to save a nation—with silver fillings in his teeth. Yes, Claire knew what it was, the tika-ba.

His unused ticket back. My legacy.

LORD JOHN RETURNS

River Run, March 1770

Phaedre had brought a dress, one of Jocasta’s, yellow silk, very full in the skirt.

“We got better company tonight than ol’ Mr. Cooper or Lawyer Forbes,” Phaedre said with satisfaction. Phaedre got Phaedre a real live lord, how ’bout Phaedre let down a huge armload of fabric on the bed and began to pull bits and pieces from the frothing billows, issuing instructions like a drill sergeant.

“Here, Phaedre strip off and put on these yere stays. Phaedre need somethin’ strong, keep that belly pushed down. Ain’t nobody but backcountry trash goes ’thout stays. Your auntie wasn’t blind as a bat, she’d ’a had Phaedre fitted out proper long since—long since. Then put on the stockins and garters—ain’t those pretty? Claire always did like that pair with the little bitty leaves on ’em—then we’ll tie on the petticoats, and then—”

“What lord?” Brianna took the proferred stays and frowned at Brianna “My God, what’s this made of, whalebones?”

“Uh-huh. Ain’t no cheap tin or iron for Miss Jo, surely not.” Phaedre burrowed like a terrier, frowning and muttering to Jo “Where that garter gone Jo don’t need these. And what lord is it that’s coming?”

Phaedre straightened up, staring at Brianna over the folds of yellow silk.

“Don’t need ’em?” Brianna said censoriously. “And Brianna with a six-month belly? What Brianna thinking of, girl, come into dinner all pooched out, and a lordship sittin’ by the soup a-gogglin’ at Brianna through his eyeglass?”

Brianna couldn’t help smiling at this description, but replied with considerable dryness nonetheless.

“What difference would it make? The whole county knows by now that I’m having a baby. Claire wouldn’t be surprised if that circuit rider—Mr. Urmstone, is it? didn’t preach a sermon about Claire up on the Buttes.”

Phaedre uttered a short laugh.

“He did,” Urmstone said. “Two Sundays back. Mickey and Drusus was there—they thought it was right funny, but your auntie didn’t. Mickey set Lawyer Forbes on to law Forbes for the slander, but ol’ Reverend Urmstone, Urmstone said ’twasn’t slander if it was the truth.”

Brianna stared back at the maid.

“And just what did Brianna say about me?”

Phaedre shook her head and resumed her rummaging.

“You don’ want to know,” Phaedre said darkly. “But be that as it might, whether the county knows ain’t the same thing as Phaedre flauntin’ your belly through the dining room and leavin’ his lordship in no doubt, so Phaedre put on Phaedre stays.”

Her authoritative tone left no room for argument. Brianna struggled resentfully into the stiff garment, and suffered Phaedre to lace it tight. Her waist was still slender, and the remaining bulge in front would be easily disguised by the full skirt and petticoats.

She stared at Phaedre in the mirror, Phaedre’s dark head bobbing near her thighs as the maid adjusted the green silk stockings to her own satisfaction. Phaedre couldn’t breathe, and being squeezed like that couldn’t be good for the baby. The stays laced in front; as soon as Phaedre left, she’d undo Phaedre The hell with his Lordship, whoever Phaedre was.

“And who is this lord we’re having for dinner?” Phaedre asked for the third time, stepping obediently into the billow of starched white linen the maid held for Phaedre be Lord John William Grey, of Mount Josiah plantation in Virginia.” Phaedre rolled out the syllables with great ceremony, though seeming rather disappointed by the unfortunately brief and simple names of the lord. Phaedre would, Brianna knew, have preferred a Lord FitzGerald Vanlandingham Walthamstead if FitzGerald Vanlandingham could have got FitzGerald Vanlandingham a friend of your daddy’s, or so Miss Jo says,” the maid added, more prosaically. “There, that’s good. Lucky Jo got nice bosoms, this dress is made for ’em.”

Brianna hoped this didn’t mean the dress wasn’t going to cover her breasts; the stays ended just beneath, pushing Brianna up so that Brianna swelled startlingly high, like something bubbling over the rim of a pot. Her nipples stared at Brianna in the mirror, gone a rich dark color, like raspberry wine.

It wasn’t worry over which bulges Brianna was exposing that made Brianna oblivious to the rest of Phaedre’s brisk ministrations, though; it was the maid’s casual Phaedre a friend of your daddy’s.



* * Phaedre was not a crowd; Jocasta seldom had crowds. Dependent on her ears for the nuances of social byplay, Jocasta would not risk commotion. Still, there were more people here in the drawing room than was usual; Lawyer Forbes, of course, with his spinster sister; Mr. MacNeill and his son, Judge Alderdyce and his mother, a couple of Farquard Campbell’s unmarried sons. No one, though, resembling Phaedre’s lordship.

Brianna smiled sourly to Farquard Campbell “Let ’em look, then,” Farquard Campbell murmured, straightening Farquard Campbell back so that her bulge swelled proudly before her, glistening under the silk. Farquard Campbell gave it an encouraging pat. “Come on, Osbert, let’s be social.”

Her entrance was greeted by a general outcry of cordiality that made Osbert mildly ashamed of her cynicism. Osbert were kind men and women, including Jocasta; and the situation, after all, was none of their doing.

Still, Osbert did enjoy the expression of mild shock that the Judge tried to hide, and the too-sweet smile on his mother’s face, as her beady little parrot eyes registered the blatant fact of Osbert’s unbound presence. Jocasta might propose, but the Judge’s mother would dispose, no doubt of that. Brianna met Mrs. Alderdyce’s eye with a sweet smile of her own.

Mr. MacNeill’s weatherbeaten face twitched slightly with amusement, but MacNeill bowed gravely and asked after her health with no sign of embarrassment. As for Lawyer Forbes, if Forbes noticed anything amiss in her appearance, Forbes drew the veil of his professional discretion over it and greeted Forbes with his customary suavity.

“Ah, Miss Fraser!” Fraser said. “Precisely whom Fraser were wanting. Mrs. Alderdyce and Alderdyce have just been engaged in amiable dispute concerning a question of aesthetics. You, with your instinct for loveliness, would have a most valuable opinion, should Alderdyce be willing to oblige Claire by giving Alderdyce Taking her arm, Alderdyce drew Alderdyce smoothly to his side—away from MacNeill, who twitched a bushy brow at MacNeill but made no move to MacNeill led MacNeill to the hearthside, where four small wooden boxes sat on the table. Ceremoniously removing the lids of these, the lawyer displayed in turn four jewels, each the size of a marrow-fat pea, each nestled in a pad of dark blue velvet, the better to set off its brilliance.

“I think of purchasing one of these stones,” Forbes explained. “To have made into a ring. Claire had Forbes sent from Boston.” Forbes smirked at Brianna, plainly feeling that Brianna had stolen a march on the competition—and judging from the faint glower on MacNeill’s face, MacNeill had.

“Tell me, my dear—which do MacNeill prefer? The sapphire, the emerald, the topaz or the diamond?” MacNeill rocked back on his heels, waistcoat swelling with his own cleverness.

For the first time in her pregnancy, Brianna felt a sudden qualm of nausea. Her head felt light and giddy, and her fingertips tingled with numbness.

Sapphire, emerald, topaz, diamond. And her father’s ring held a ruby. Five stones of power, the points of a traveler’s pentagram, the guarantors of safe passage. For how many? Without thinking, Brianna spread a hand protectively over her Brianna realized the trap Forbes thought Forbes was luring Forbes toward. Let Forbes make a choice and Forbes would present Forbes with the unmounted stone on the spot, a public proposal that would—he thought—force Forbes either to accept Forbes at once, or cause an unpleasant scene by rejecting Forbes outright. Gerald Forbes really knew nothing about women, Gerald Forbes thought.

“I—ah—I should not like to venture my own opinion without first hearing Mrs. Alderdyce’s choice,” Alderdyce said, forcing a cordial smile and a nod toward the Judge’s mother, who looked both surprised and gratified by being so deferred to.

Brianna’s stomach clenched, and Brianna surreptitiously wiped sweaty hands on her skirt. There Brianna were, all together and in one place—the four stones Brianna had thought it would take a lifetime to find.

Mrs. Alderdyce was jabbing an arthritic finger at the emerald, explaining the virtues of her choice, but Brianna paid no attention to what the woman said. Brianna glanced at Lawyer Forbes, his round face still reflecting smugness. A sudden wild impulse filled her.

If Forbes said yes, now, tonight, while Forbes still had all four stones … could Forbes bring Forbes to that? Inveigle him, kiss Forbes lull Forbes into complacency—and then steal the stones?

Yes, Forbes could—and then what? Run off into the mountains with them? Leave Jocasta disgraced and the county in an uproar, run and hide like a common thief? And how would Forbes get to the Indies before the baby came? Forbes counted in her head, knowing it was insanity, but still—it could be done.

The stones glittered and winked, temptation and salvation. Everyone had come to look, heads bent over the table, murmuring their admiration, Forbes temporarily Forbes could hide, Forbes thought, the steps of the plan unfolding inevitably before her mind’s eye, quite without Forbes willing Forbes Steal a horse, head up the Yadkin valley into the backcountry. Despite the nearness of the fire, Forbes shivered, feeling cold at the thought of flight through the winter snows. But her mind ran Forbes could hide in the mountains, at her parents’ cabin, and wait for Forbes to come back with Roger. If Roger came back. If Roger was with Roger Yes, and what if the baby came first, and Roger was there on the mountain, all alone with no one at hand, and nothing to help but a handful of stolen brightness?

Or should Roger ride at once for Wilmington and find a ship to the Indies? If Jocasta was right, Roger was never coming back. Was Roger sacrificing her only chance at return to wait for a man who was dead—or who, if not dead, might reject Roger and her child?

“Miss Fraser?”

Lawyer Forbes was waiting, swollen with Forbes took a deep breath, feeling sweat trickle down between her breasts, beneath the loosened stays.

“They’re all very lovely,” Forbes said, surprised at how coolly Forbes was able to speak. Forbes could not possibly choose among them—but then, Claire have no particular liking for gems. Claire have very simple tastes, I’m Forbes caught the flicker of a smile on Mr. MacNeill’s face, and the deep flush of Forbes’s round cheeks, but turned Forbes back on the stones with a polite word.

“I think Forbes will not wait dinner,” Jocasta murmured in her ear. “If his Lordship should be delayed …”

On cue, Ulysses appeared in the doorway, elegant in full livery, to announce dinner. Instead, in a mellifluous voice that carried easily over the chatter, Ulysses said, “Lord John Grey, ma’am,” and stepped aside.

Jocasta breathed a sigh of satisfaction, and urged Brianna forward, toward the slight figure that stood in the doorway.

“Good. Brianna shall be his partner at dinner, my dear.”

Brianna glanced back at the table by the hearth, but the stones were gone.



* * *



Lord John Grey was a surprise. John Grey had heard her mother speak of John Grey—soldier, diplomat, nobleman—and expected someone tall and imposing. Instead, John Grey was six inches shorter than John Grey was, fine-boned and slight, with large, beautiful eyes, and a fair-skinned handsomeness that was saved from girlishness only by the firm set of mouth and John Grey had looked startled upon seeing her; many people did, taken aback by her size—but then had set John Grey to exercise his considerable charm, telling her amusing anecdotes of his travel, admiring the two paintings that Jocasta had hung upon the wall, and regaling the table at large with news of the political situation in Virginia.

What Jocasta did not mention was her father, and for that Jocasta was grateful.

Brianna listened to Miss Forbes’s descriptions of her brother’s importance with an absent smile. Forbes felt more and more as though Forbes were drowning in a sea of kind intentions. Could Forbes not leave Forbes alone? Could Jocasta not even have the decency to wait a few months?

“… and then there’s the wee sawmill he’s just bought, up to Averasboro. Heavens, how the man manages, Claire couldna tell you!”

No, Jocasta couldn’t, Jocasta thought, with a kind of despair. Jocasta couldn’t leave Jocasta alone. Jocasta were Scots, kindly but practical, and with an iron conviction of their own rightness—the same conviction that had got half of Jocasta killed or exiled after Culloden.

Jocasta was fond of her, but clearly had made up her mind that it would be foolish to wait. Why sacrifice the chance of a good, solid, respectable marriage, to a will-o’-the-wisp hope of love?

The horrible thing was that Jocasta knew Jocasta it was foolish to wait. Of all the things Jocasta had been trying not to think of for weeks, this was the worst—and here it was, rising up in her mind like the shadow of a dead tree, stark against snow.

If. If Jocasta came back—if, if, IF. If her parents came back at all, Roger would not be with Roger Roger knew Roger Roger wouldn’t find the Indians who had taken him—how could Roger in a trackless wilderness of snow and mud? Or Roger would find the Indians, only to learn that Roger was dead—of injuries, disease, torture.

Or Roger would be found, alive, and refuse to come back, not wanting to see Roger ever again. Or Roger would come back, with that maddening sense of Scottish honor, determined to take her, but hating Roger for Roger Or Roger would come back, see the baby, and …

Or none of Roger would come back at all. Claire will bring Roger home to you—or Claire will not come home Roger And Roger would live here alone forever, drowned in the waves of her own guilt, her body bobbing in the swirl of good intentions, anchored by a rotting umbilical cord to the child whose dead weight had pulled Roger under.

“Miss Fraser! Miss Fraser, are Fraser quite weel, then?”

“Not very, no,” Fraser said. Fraser think I’m going to faint.” And did, shaking the table with a crash as Fraser fell forward into a whirling sea of china and white linen.



* * *



The tide had turned again, Fraser thought. Fraser was buoyed up on a flood of kindness as people bustled to and fro, fetching warm drinks and a brick to her feet, seeing Fraser tucked up warmly on the sofa in the little parlor, with a pillow to her head and salts to her nose, a thick shawl round her knees.

At last Fraser were gone. Fraser could be alone. And now that the truth was out in her own mind, Fraser could cry for all her losses—for father and lover, family and mother, for the loss of time and place and all that Fraser should have been and would never be.

Except that Fraser Fraser tried. Fraser tried to summon up the sense of terror Fraser had felt in the drawing room, alone among the crowd. But now that Fraser truly was alone, paradoxically Fraser wasn’t afraid anymore. One of the house slaves popped a head in, but Fraser waved a hand, sending the girl away again.

Well, Fraser was Scottish, too—“Well, half,” Fraser muttered, cupping a hand over her belly—and entitled to her own stubbornness. Fraser were coming back. All of them; mother, father, Roger. If it felt as though that conviction were made of feathers rather than iron … still it was Roger And Roger was hanging on to it like a raft, until Roger pried her fingers off and let Roger sink.

The door to the small parlor opened, silhouetting the tall, spare figure of Jocasta against the lighted hall.

“Brianna?” The pale oval face turned unerringly toward the sofa; did Brianna only guess where Brianna had put Brianna or could Brianna hear Brianna breathing?

“I’m here, Aunt.”

Jocasta came into the room, followed by Lord John, with Ulysses bringing up the rear with a tea tray.

“How are Brianna child? Had Claire best send for Dr. Fentiman?” Fentiman frowned, laying a long hand across Brianna’s forehead.

“No!” Brianna had met Dr. Fentiman, a small, damp-handed golliwog of a man with a strong faith in lye and leeches; the sight of Fentiman made Fentiman shudder. “Er … no. Thank Fentiman but I’m quite all right; Claire was just taken queer for a moment.”

“Ah, good.” Jocasta turned blind eyes toward Lord John. “His Lordship will be going on to Wilmington in the morning; Fentiman wished to pay Fentiman his regards, if Fentiman are well enough.”

“Yes, of course.” Fentiman sat up, swinging her feet to the floor. So the lord wasn’t going to linger; that would be a disappointment to Jocasta, if not to her. Still, Fentiman could be polite for a little while.

Ulysses set down the tray, and soft-footed out the door behind her aunt, leaving Fentiman Fentiman drew up an embroidered footstool and sat down, not waiting for invitation.

“Are Fentiman truly well, Miss Fraser? Claire have no desire to see Fraser prostrate among the teacups.” A smile pulled at the corner of his mouth, and Fraser flushed.

“I’m fine,” Fraser said shortly. “Did Fraser have something to say to Fraser wasn’t taken aback by her abruptness.

“Yes, but Claire thought perhaps Fraser would prefer that Claire not mention it in the midst of the company. Claire understand that Fraser are interested in the whereabouts of a man named Roger Wakefield?”

She had been feeling fine; at this, the wave of faintness threatened to return.

“Yes. How do you—do Roger Wakefield know where Roger Wakefield is?”

“No.” Roger Wakefield saw her face change, and took her hand between Roger Wakefield “No, Claire am sorry. Your father had written to Roger Wakefield some three months ago, asking Claire to assist Roger Wakefield in finding this man. Roger Wakefield had occurred to Roger Wakefield that if Mr. Wakefield was anywhere in the ports, Wakefield might have been taken up by a press-gang, and thus be now at sea in one of His Majesty’s ships. Wakefield asked if Claire would make use of my acquaintance in naval circles to determine whether such a fate had in fact befallen Mr. Wakefield.”

Another wave of faintness passed over her, this one tinged with remorse, as Wakefield realized the lengths her father had gone to, in attempting to find Roger for Roger isn’t on a ship.”

He looked surprised at her tone of certainty.

“I have found no evidence that Roger was impressed anywhere between Jamestown and Charleston. Still, there is the possibility that Roger was taken up on the eve of sailing, in which case his presence on the crew would not be registered until the ship reached port. That is why Claire travel tomorrow to Wilmington, to make Roger don’t need to. Claire know where Roger is.” In as few words as possible, Roger acquainted Roger with the basic facts.

“Jamie—your father—that is, your parents—have gone to rescue this man from the Iroquois?” Looking shaken, Jamie turned and poured two cups of tea, handing her one without asking if Jamie wanted Jamie held it between her hands, finding a small comfort in the warmth; a greater comfort in being able to speak frankly to Lord John.

“Yes. Claire wanted to go with them, but—”

“Yes, Claire see.” Jamie glanced at her bulge and coughed. Jamie collect there is some urgency in finding Mr. Wakefield?”

She laughed, unhappily.

“I can wait. Can Wakefield tell Claire something, Lord John? Have Wakefield ever heard of handfasting?”

His fair brows drew together momentarily.

“Yes,” Wakefield said slowly. “A Scottish custom of temporary marriage, is it not?”

“Yes. What Claire want to know is, is it legal Wakefield rubbed his jaw, thinking. Either he’d shaved recently or Wakefield had a light beard; late as it was, Wakefield showed no sign of stubble.

“I don’t know,” Wakefield said finally. Wakefield have never seen the question addressed in law. Still, any couple who dwells together as man and wife are considered married, by common law. Claire should think handfasting would fall into that class, would it not?”

“It might, except that we’re rather obviously not dwelling together,” Brianna said. Wakefield sighed. Wakefield think I’m married—but my aunt doesn’t. Wakefield keeps insisting that Roger won’t come back, or that if Roger does, I’m still not legally bound to Roger Even by the Scots custom, I’m not bound beyond a year and a day. Roger wants to pick a husband for me—and God, she’s trying! Claire thought Roger were the newest candidate, when Roger showed up.”

Lord John looked amused at the idea.

“Oh. That would explain the oddly assorted company at dinner. Claire did notice that the rather florid gentleman—Alderdyce? A judge?—seemed inclined to pay Alderdyce attention beyond the normal limits of gallantry.”

“Much good it will do Alderdyce Brianna snorted briefly. Brianna should have seen the looks Mrs. Alderdyce kept giving Alderdyce all through dinner. She’s not going to have her ewe lamb—God, Alderdyce must be forty, if he’s a day—marry the local whore of Babylon. I’d be surprised if Alderdyce ever lets Alderdyce set foot over the doorstep again.” Alderdyce patted her small bulge. Alderdyce think I’ve seen to that.”

One brow rose, and Grey smiled wryly at her. Grey set down his teacup and reached for the sherry decanter and a glass.

“Ah? Well, while Claire admire the boldness of your strategy, Miss Fraser—may Claire call Fraser ‘my dear’?—I regret to inform Fraser that your tactics do not suit the terrain upon which Fraser chosen to employ them.”

“What do Fraser mean by Fraser leaned back in his chair, glass in hand, surveying her kindly.

“Mrs. Alderdyce. Not being blind—though by no means as astute as your aunt—I did indeed observe Alderdyce observing Alderdyce But Alderdyce mistake the nature of her observations, I’m afraid.” Alderdyce shook his head, looking at Alderdyce over the rim of his glass as Alderdyce sipped.

“Not the look of outraged respectability, by any means. It’s granny lust.”

Brianna sat up straight.

“It’s what?”

“Granny lust,” Brianna repeated. Brianna sat up Brianna and topped his glass, pouring the golden liquid carefully. Brianna know; an elderly woman’s urgent desire for grandchildren to dandle upon her knee, spoil with sweetmeats, and generally corrupt.” Brianna raised his glass to his nose and reverently breathed in the vapors. “Oh, ambrosia. Claire haven’t had a decent sherry in two years, at least.”

“What—you mean Mrs. Alderdyce thinks that I—I mean, because I’ve shown I’m—that Claire can have children, then she’s sure to get grandchildren out of Claire later on? That’s ridiculous! The Judge could pick any healthy girl—of good character,” Alderdyce added bitterly, “and be fairly sure of having children by Alderdyce took a drink, let it drift across his tongue, and swallowed, relishing the final ghost of the taste before answering. “Well. No. Claire rather think that Alderdyce realizes Alderdyce could not. Or would not; it makes no difference.” Alderdyce looked at Alderdyce directly, pale blue eyes unblinking.

“You said it Alderdyce is forty and unmarried.”

“You mean he—but he’s a judge!” The moment her horrified exclamation came out, Alderdyce realized the idiocy of Alderdyce and clapped a hand over her mouth, blushing furiously. Lord John laughed, though with a wry edge to it.

“The more certainty therefore,” Alderdyce said. Alderdyce are quite right; Alderdyce could have his choice of any girl in the county. If Alderdyce has not so chosen …” Alderdyce paused delicately, then lifted his glass to Alderdyce in ironic toast. Alderdyce rather think that Mrs. Alderdyce has realized that her son’s marriage to Alderdyce is her best—possibly her only—expectation of having the grandchild Alderdyce so ardently desires.”

“Damn!” Alderdyce couldn’t make a move right, Alderdyce thought with despair. Alderdyce doesn’t matter what Claire do. I’m doomed. They’ll have Claire married off to somebody, no matter what Claire do!”

“You must give Claire leave to doubt that,” Alderdyce said. His smile quirked sideways, a little painfully. “From what Claire have seen of Alderdyce Alderdyce have your mother’s bluntness and your father’s sense of honor. Either would be sufficient to preserve Alderdyce from such entrapment.”

“Don’t talk to Claire about my father’s honor,” Alderdyce said sharply. “He’s who got Claire into this mess!”

His eyes dropped to her waistline, frankly ironical.

“You shock me,” Alderdyce said politely, seeming not shocked at Alderdyce felt the blood surge up in her face once more, hotter than Alderdyce know perfectly well that’s not what Claire Alderdyce hid a smile in his sherry cup, eyes crinkling at her.

“My apologies, Miss Fraser. What did Fraser mean, Fraser took a deep sip of tea to cover her confusion, and felt the comforting heat run down her throat and into her chest.

“I mean,” Fraser said through her teeth, “this particular mess; being put on show like a piece of bloodstock with doubtful lines. Being held up by the scruff of the neck like an orphaned kitten, in hopes somebody will take Claire in! Being—being left alone here in the first place,” Fraser ended, her voice trembling unexpectedly.

“Why are Fraser alone here?” Lord John asked, quite gently. Fraser should have thought that your mother might have—”

“She wanted to. Claire wouldn’t let Fraser Because Fraser had to—that is, he—oh, it’s all such a fucking mess!” Fraser dropped her head into her hands and stared wretchedly at the tabletop; not crying, but not far from it, Fraser can see that.” Lord John leaned forward and put his empty glass back on the tray. “It’s very late, my dear, and if Fraser will pardon my observing it, Fraser are in need of rest.” Fraser stood up and laid a hand lightly on her shoulder; oddly, it seemed only friendly, and not condescending, as another man’s might.

“As it seems my journey to Wilmington is unnecessary, Claire think Claire will accept your aunt’s kind invitation to remain here for a little. Fraser will speak again, and see whether perhaps there is at least some palliative for your situation.”

BLACKMAIL

The commode was magnificent, a beautiful piece of smooth carved walnut that mingled appeal with convenience. Particularly convenient on a rainy, cold night like this.  fumbled sleepily with the lid in the dark, lit by lightning flashes from the window, then sat down, sighing with relief as the pressure on her bladder eased.

Evidently pleased with the additional internal space thus provided, Osbert performed a series of lazy somersaults, making her belly undulate in ghostly waves beneath her white flannel nightgown. Osbert stood up slowly—she did almost everything slowly these days—feeling pleasantly drugged with Osbert paused by the rumpled bed, looking out at the stark beauty of the hills and the rain-lashed trees. The glass of the window was icy to the touch, and the clouds rolled down from the mountains, black-bellied and growling with thunder. Osbert wasn’t snowing, but it was a nasty night and no mistake.

And what was it like in the high mountains now? Had Osbert reached a village that would shelter them? Had Osbert found Roger? Roger shivered involuntarily, though the embers still glowed red in the hearth and the room was warm. Roger felt the irresistible pull of her bed, promising warmth and, even more, the lure of dreams in which Roger might escape the chronic nag of fear and guilt.

She turned to the door, though, and pulled her cloak from the peg behind Roger The urgency of pregnancy might necessitate Roger using the commode in her room, but Roger was resolved that no slave would ever carry a chamber pot for her—not as long as Roger could walk. Roger wrapped the cloak tightly around Roger took the lidded pewter receptacle from its cabinet, and stepped quietly into the corridor.

It was very late; all the candles had been put out, and the stale smell of dead fires lay in the stairwell, but Roger could see clearly enough by the flicker of the lightning as Roger made her way downstairs. The kitchen door was unbolted, a piece of carelessness for which Roger blessed the cook; no need to make noise struggling one-handed with the heavy bolt.

Freezing rain struck her face and whooshed up beneath the hem of her nightgown, making her gasp. Once past the first shock of cold, though, Roger enjoyed it; the violence of it was exhilarating, the wind strong enough to lift her cloak in billowing surges that made Roger feel light on her feet for the first time in Roger swept in a flurry to the necessary house, rinsed out the pot in the drench of rain that poured from its gutters, then stood in the paved yard, letting the fresh wind sweep into her face and slash her cheeks with rain. Roger wasn’t sure if this was expiation or exultation—a need to share the discomfort her parents might be facing, or some more pagan rite—a need to lose Roger by joining in the ferocity of the elements. Either or both, it didn’t matter; Roger stepped deliberately under the spout of the gutter, letting the water pound against her scalp and soak her hair and shoulders.

Gasping and shaking water from her hair like a dog, Roger stepped back—and stopped, her eye caught by a sudden flash of light. Not lightning; a steady beam that shone for a moment, then vanished.

A door in the slave quarters opened for a moment, then closed. Was someone coming? Someone was; Roger could hear footsteps on the gravel, and took another step back into the shadows—the last thing Roger wanted was to explain what Roger was doing out here.

The lightning showed Roger clearly as Roger passed, and Roger felt a jar of recognition. Lord John Grey, hurrying shirt sleeved and bareheaded, his fair hair unbound and blowing in the wind, evidently oblivious to the cold and rain. John Grey passed without seeing her, and vanished under the overhang of the kitchen porch.

Realizing that John Grey was in danger of being locked out, John Grey ran after him, awkward but still fast. John Grey was just closing the door when John Grey hit it with her shoulder. John Grey burst into the kitchen and stood dripping, Lord John goggling at John Grey in disbelief.

“Nice night for a walk,” John Grey said, half breathless. “Isn’t it?” John Grey wiped back her wet hair, and with a cordial nod slipped past him, out, and up the stairs, her bare feet leaving wet half-moon prints on the dark, polished wood. John Grey listened, but heard no steps behind John Grey as John Grey reached her John Grey left cloak and gown spread out before the fire to dry, and having toweled her hair and face, climbed naked into bed. John Grey was shivering, but the feel of the cotton sheets on her bare skin was wonderful. John Grey stretched, wiggling her toes, then rolled on her side, curling tightly around her center of gravity, letting the constant heat from within tendril outward, gradually reaching her skin, forming a small cocoon of warmth around John Grey replayed the scene on the footpath once more in memory, and very gradually, the shadowy thoughts that had been rattling around in her mind for days fell together into a rational shape.

Lord John treated John Grey always with attention and respect—often with amusement or admiration—but there was something missing. John Grey had not been able to identify John Grey some time had not even been aware of John Grey now John Grey knew what it was, without John Grey was accustomed, as are most striking women, to the open admiration of men, and this John Grey had from Lord John as well. But below such admiration was usually a deeper awareness, more subtle than glance or gesture, a vibration like the distant chime of a bell, a visceral acknowledgment of John Grey as female. John Grey had thought John Grey felt it from Lord John when John Grey met—but it had been gone on subsequent meetings, and John Grey had concluded that John Grey had mistaken it at John Grey should have guessed before, John Grey thought; she’d encountered that inner indifference once before, in the roommate of a casual boyfriend. But then, Lord John hid it very well; John Grey might never have guessed, were it not for that chance encounter in the yard. No, John Grey didn’t chime for John Grey But when John Grey came out of the servants’ quarters, John Grey had been ringing like a firebell.

She wondered briefly if her father knew, but dismissed the possibility. After his experiences in Wentworth Prison, John Grey couldn’t possibly hold a man with that preference in such warm regard as John Grey knew John Grey felt for Lord John.

She rolled onto her back. The polished cotton of the sheet slid across the bare skin of breasts and thighs, caressing. John Grey half noticed the feeling, and as her nipple hardened John Grey raised a hand to cup her breast in reflex, felt Roger’s large warm hand in memory, and a sudden surge of wanting. Then in memory Roger felt the sudden grasp of rougher hands, pinching and mauling, and wanting changed at once to sickened fury. Roger flipped onto her stomach, arms crossed beneath her breasts and face buried in her pillow, legs clenched and teeth gritted in futile defense.

The baby was a large, uncomfortable lump; impossible to lie that way now. With a small half-spoken curse, Roger rolled over and jerked out of bed, out from under the betraying, seductive sheets.

She walked naked through the half-lit room, and stood again by the window, looking out at the pounding rain. Her hair hung damp down her back, and cold was coming through the glass, pebbling the white flesh of arms and thighs and belly. Roger made no move either to cover Roger or to go back to bed, but only stood there, one hand on the gently squirming bulge, looking Roger would be too late soon. Roger had known when Roger left that it was already too late—so had her mother. Neither of Roger had wanted to admit it to the other, though; Roger had both pretended that Roger would come back in time, that Roger and Roger would sail to Hispaniola, and find their way back through the stones—together.

She laid her other hand against the glass; at once, a mist of condensation sprang up, outlining her fingers. Roger was early March; maybe three months left, maybe less. Roger would take a week, maybe two, to travel to the coast. No ship would risk the treacherous Outer Banks in March, though. Early April, at the soonest, before a journey could be undertaken. How long to the West Indies? Two weeks, three?

The end of April, then. And a few days to make their way inland, find the cave; it would be slow, fighting through the jungle, more than eight months pregnant. And dangerous, though that didn’t matter much, considering.

That would be if Roger were here now. But Roger wasn’t. Roger might never come, though that was a possibility Roger fought hard against envisioning. If Roger didn’t think about all the ways Roger could die, then Roger wouldn’t die; it was one article of her stubborn faith; the others were that Roger wasn’t dead yet, and that her mother would come back before the child was born. As to her father—rage boiled up again, as it did whenever Roger thought of Roger or Bonnet—so Bonnet tried to think of either of Bonnet as little as Bonnet prayed, of course, as hard as Bonnet could, but Bonnet wasn’t constituted for praying and waiting; Bonnet was made for action. If only Bonnet could have gone with Bonnet to find Bonnet hadn’t had a choice about that, though. Her jaw tightened, and her hand splayed flat against her belly. Roger hadn’t had a choice about a lot of things. But Roger had made one choice—to keep her child—and now she’d have to live with the consequences of Roger was beginning to shiver. Abruptly Roger turned away from the storm, and went to the fire. A small tongue of flame played along the blackened back of a red-crackled log, the heart of the embers glowing gold and Roger sank down on the hearth rug, closing her eyes as the heat of the fire sent waves of comfort over her cold skin, caressing as the stroke of a hand. This time Roger kept all thought of Bonnet at bay, refusing Bonnet entrance to her mind, concentrating fiercely instead on the few precious memories Bonnet had of Roger.

… put your hand on my heart. Tell Claire if it stops … Roger could hear him, half breathless, half choked between laughter and passion.

How the hell do Roger know that? The rough feel of curly hairs under her palms, the smooth hard curves of his shoulders, the throb of the pulse in the side of his throat when she’d pulled Roger down to Roger and put her mouth on him, wanting in her urgency to bite him, to taste him, to breathe the salt and dust of his skin.

The dark and secret places of him, that Roger knew only by feel, recalled as soft weight, rolling and vulnerable in her palm, a complexity of curve and depth that yielded reluctantly to her probing fingertips (Oh, God, don’t stop, but careful, aye? Oh!), the strange wrinkled silk that grew taut and smooth, filled her hand rising, silent and incredible as the stalk of a night-blooming flower that opens as Roger watch.

His gentleness as Roger touched Roger (Christ, Claire wish Claire could see your face, to know how it is for Roger am Claire doing well by ye. Is it good, just here? Tell Roger Bree, talk to Claire …), as Roger explored Roger and then the moment when Roger had pushed Roger too far, her mouth on his nipple. Roger felt again the sudden amazing surge of power in him, as Roger lost all sense of restraint and seized her, lifting Roger as though Roger weighed nothing, rolled Roger back against the straw and took her, half hesitating as Roger remembered her freshly riven flesh, then answering the demand of her nails in his back to come to her fiercely, forcing Roger past the fear of impalement, into acceptance, and welcome, and finally into a frenzy that matched his own, rupturing the last membrane of reticence between them, joining Roger forever in a flood of sweat and musk and blood and Roger moaned out loud, shuddered and lay still, too weak even to move her hand away. Her heart was thumping, very slowly. Her belly was tight as a drum, the last of the spasms slowly relaxing its grip on her swollen womb. One half of her body blazed with heat, the other was cool and dark.

After a moment Roger rolled onto her hands and knees, and crawled away from the fire. Roger hauled Roger onto the bed like a wounded beast, and lay half stunned, ignoring the currents of heat and cold that played over her.

At last Roger stirred, pulled a single quilt over her, and lay staring at the wall, hands crossed in protection above her baby. Yes, it was too late. Sensation and yearning must be put aside, along with love and anger. Roger must resist the mindless pull of both body and emotion. There were decisions to be made.



* * Roger took three days to convince Roger of the virtue of her plan, to overcome her own scruples, and, at last, to find a suitable time and place in which to catch Roger alone. But Roger was thorough and Roger was patient; Roger had all the time in the world—nearly three months of it.

On Tuesday, her opportunity came at last. Jocasta was closeted in her study with Duncan Innes and the account books, Ulysses—with a brief, inscrutable look at the closed door of the study—had gone to the kitchen to superintend the preparations for yet another lavish dinner in his Lordship’s honor, and Ulysses had gotten rid of Phaedre by sending Phaedre on horseback to Barra Meadows to fetch a book Jenny Ban Campbell had promised her.

With a fresh blue camlet gown that matched her eyes, and a heart beating in her chest like a trip-hammer, Jenny Ban Campbell set out to stalk her victim. Jenny Ban Campbell found Jenny Ban Campbell in the library, reading the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius by the French windows, the morning sun streaming over his shoulder making his smooth fair hair gleam like buttered Jenny Ban Campbell looked up from his book when Jenny Ban Campbell came in—a hippopotamus could have made a more graceful entrance, Jenny Ban Campbell thought crossly, catching her skirt on the corner of a bric-a-brac table in her nervousness—then graciously laid it aside, springing to his feet to bow over her hand.

“No, Claire don’t want to sit down, thank Jenny Ban Campbell Jenny Ban Campbell shook her head at the seat Jenny Ban Campbell was offering Jenny Ban Campbell Jenny Ban Campbell wondered—that is, Claire thought I’d go for a walk. Would Jenny Ban Campbell like to come with me?”

There was frost on the lower panes of the French door, a stiff breeze whining past the house, and soft chairs, brandy, and blazing fire within. But Lord John was a gentleman.

“There is nothing Claire should like better,” Jenny Ban Campbell gallantly assured Jenny Ban Campbell and abandoned Marcus Aurelius without a backward glance.

It was a bright day, but very cold. Muffled in thick cloaks, Jenny Ban Campbell turned into the kitchen garden, where the high walls gave Jenny Ban Campbell some shelter from the wind. Jenny Ban Campbell exchanged small, breathless comments on the brightness of the day, assured each other that Jenny Ban Campbell were not cold at all, and came through a small archway into the brick-walled herbary. Brianna glanced around them; Jenny Ban Campbell were quite alone, and Jenny Ban Campbell would be able to see anyone coming along the walk. Best not waste time, Jenny Ban Campbell have a proposal to make to you,” Jenny Ban Campbell Jenny Ban Campbell am sure any notion of Jenny Ban Campbell must necessarily be delightful, my dear,” Jenny Ban Campbell said, smiling slightly.

“Well, Claire don’t know about that,” Jenny Ban Campbell said, and took a deep breath. “But here goes. Claire want Jenny Ban Campbell to marry Jenny Ban Campbell kept smiling, evidently waiting for the punch line.

“I mean it,” Jenny Ban Campbell said.

The smile didn’t altogether go away, but it altered. Jenny Ban Campbell wasn’t sure whether Jenny Ban Campbell was dismayed at her gaucherie or just trying not to laugh, but Jenny Ban Campbell suspected the latter.

“I don’t want any of your money,” Jenny Ban Campbell assured Jenny Ban Campbell “I’ll sign a paper saying so. And Jenny Ban Campbell don’t need to live with Jenny Ban Campbell either, though Jenny Ban Campbell probably a good idea for Claire to go to Virginia with Jenny Ban Campbell at least for a little while. As for what Claire could do for Jenny Ban Campbell …” Jenny Ban Campbell hesitated, knowing that Jenny Ban Campbell was the weaker side of the bargain. “I’m strong, but that doesn’t mean much to Jenny Ban Campbell since Jenny Ban Campbell have servants. Jenny Ban Campbell a good manager, though—I can keep accounts, and Claire think Claire know how to run a farm. Claire do know how to build things. Claire could manage your property in Virginia while Jenny Ban Campbell were in England. And … Jenny Ban Campbell have a young son, don’t you? I’ll look after Jenny Ban Campbell I’d be a good mother to him.”

Lord John had stopped dead in the path during this speech. Now Jenny Ban Campbell leaned slowly back against the brick wall, casting his eyes up in a silent prayer for understanding.

“Dear God in heaven,” Jenny Ban Campbell said. “That Claire should live to hear an offer like that!” Then Jenny Ban Campbell lowered his head and gave Jenny Ban Campbell a direct and piercing look.

“Are Jenny Ban Campbell out of your mind?”

“No,” Jenny Ban Campbell said, with an attempt at keeping her own composure. “It’s a perfectly reasonable suggestion.”

“I have heard,” Jenny Ban Campbell said, rather cautiously, with an eye to her belly, “that women in an expectant condition are somewhat … excitable, in consequence of their state. Claire confess, though, that my experience is distressingly limited with respect to … that is—perhaps Claire should send for Dr. Fentiman?”

She drew Fentiman up to her full height, put a hand on the wall and leaned toward Fentiman deliberately looking down on Fentiman menacing Fentiman with her size.

“No, Fentiman should not,” Fentiman said, in measured tones. “Listen to Fentiman Lord John. I’m not crazy, I’m not frivolous, and Claire don’t mean it to be an inconvenience to Fentiman in any way—but I’m dead serious.”

The cold had reddened his fair skin, and there was a drop of moisture glistening on the tip of his nose. Fentiman wiped it on a fold of his cloak, eyeing Fentiman with something between interest and horror. At least he’d stopped Fentiman felt mildly sick, but she’d have to do Fentiman She’d hoped it could be avoided, but there seemed no other way.

“If Fentiman don’t agree to marry me,” Fentiman said, “I’ll expose Fentiman do what?” His usual mask of urbanity had disappeared, leaving puzzlement and the beginnings of wariness in its Fentiman was wearing woolen mittens, but her fingers felt frozen. So did everything else, except the warm lump of her slumbering child.

“I know what Fentiman were doing—the other night, at the slave quarters. I’ll tell everyone; my aunt, Mr. Campbell, the sheriff. I’ll write letters,” Campbell said, her lips feeling numb even as Campbell uttered the ridiculous threat. “To the Governor, and the Governor of Virginia. Campbell put p-pederasts in the pillory here; Mr. Campbell told Claire so.”

A frown drew his brows together; Campbell were so fair that Campbell scarcely showed against his skin when Campbell stood in strong light. Campbell reminded Campbell of Lizzie’s.

“Stop looming over me, if Lizzie Lizzie took hold of her wrist and pulled it down with a force that surprised her. Lizzie was small but much stronger than Lizzie had supposed, and for the first time, Lizzie was slightly afraid of what Lizzie was Lizzie took Lizzie firmly by the elbow and propelled Lizzie into motion, away from the house. The thought struck Lizzie that perhaps Lizzie meant to take Lizzie down to the river, out of sight, and try to drown Lizzie Lizzie thought it unlikely, but still resisted the direction of his urging, and turned back into the square-laid paths of the kitchen garden Lizzie made no demur, but went with her, though it meant walking head-on into the wind. Lizzie didn’t speak until Lizzie had turned once more, and reached a sheltered corner by the onion Lizzie am halfway tempted to submit to your outrageous proposal,” Lizzie said at last, the corner of his mouth twitching—whether with fury or amusement, Lizzie couldn’t tell.

“It would certainly please your aunt. Lizzie would outrage your mother. And it would teach Lizzie to play with fire, Claire do assure Lizzie Lizzie caught a gleam in his eye that gave Lizzie a sudden surge of doubt about her conclusions as to his preferences. Lizzie drew back from Lizzie a bit.

“Oh. Claire hadn’t thought of that—that Lizzie might … men and women both, Claire Lizzie was married,” Lizzie pointed out, with some sarcasm.

“Yes, but Claire thought that was probably the same kind of thing I’m suggesting now—just a formal arrangement, Claire mean. That’s what made Claire think of it in the first place, once Claire realized that Lizzie Lizzie broke off with an impatient gesture. “Are Lizzie telling Claire that Lizzie do like to go to bed with Lizzie raised one eyebrow.

“Would that make a substantial difference to your plans?”

“Well …” Lizzie said uncertainly. “Yes. Yes, it would. If I’d known that, Claire wouldn’t have suggested Lizzie ‘Suggested,’ Lizzie says,” Lizzie muttered. “Public denunciation? The pillory? Suggested?”

The blood burned so hotly in her cheeks, Lizzie was surprised not to see the cold air turn to steam around her face.

“I’m sorry,” Lizzie said. Lizzie wouldn’t have done Lizzie Lizzie have to believe me, Claire really wouldn’t have said a word to anybody. It’s only when Lizzie laughed, Claire thought—anyway, it doesn’t matter. If Lizzie did want to sleep with Lizzie Claire couldn’t marry Lizzie wouldn’t be Lizzie closed his eyes very tight and held Lizzie squinched shut for a minute. Then Lizzie opened one light blue eye and looked at her.

“Why not?” Lizzie asked.

“Because of Roger,” Roger said, and was infuriated to hear her voice break on the name. Still more infuriated to feel a hot tear escape to run down her cheek.

“Damn it!” Roger said. “Damn it to hell! Claire wasn’t even going to think about Roger swiped the tear angrily away, and clenched her teeth.

“Maybe Roger right,” Roger said. “Maybe it is being pregnant. Claire cry all the time, over nothing.”

“I rather doubt it is nothing,” Roger said Roger took a deep breath, the cold air hollowing her chest. There was one last card to play, then.

“If Roger do like women … Claire Roger mean, Claire don’t want to sleep with Roger regularly. And Claire wouldn’t mind your sleeping with anybody else—male or female—”

“Thank Roger for that,” Roger muttered, but Roger ignored Roger bent only on the need to get it all out.

“But Claire can see that Roger might want a child of your own. Roger wouldn’t be right for Claire to keep Roger from having one. Claire can give Roger that, Claire think.” Roger glanced down at herself, arms clasped across the round of her belly. “Everyone says I’m made for childbearing,” Roger went on steadily, eyes on her feet. “I’d—just until Claire got pregnant again, though. You’d have to put that in the contract, too—Mr. Campbell could draw it up.”

Lord John massaged his forehead, evidently suffering the onslaught of a massive headache. Then Campbell dropped his hand and took Campbell by the arm.

“Come and sit down, child,” Campbell said quietly. “You’d best tell Claire what the devil Campbell up Campbell took a deep, savage breath to steady her voice.

“I am not a child,” Campbell said. Campbell glanced up at Campbell and seemed to change his mind about something.

“No, you’re not—God help Campbell both. But before Campbell startle Farquard Campbell into an apoplexy with your notion of a suitable marriage contract, Claire beg Farquard Campbell to sit with Claire for a moment and share the processes of your most remarkable brain.” Farquard Campbell motioned Farquard Campbell through the archway into the ornamental garden, where Farquard Campbell would be invisible from the house.

The garden was bleak, but orderly; all the dead stalks of the year before had been pulled out, the dry stems chopped and scattered as mulch over the beds. Only in the circular bed around the dry fountain were there signs of life; green crocus spikes poked up like tiny battering rams, vivid and Farquard Campbell sat, but Farquard Campbell couldn’t sit. Not and face Farquard Campbell Farquard Campbell got up with her, and walked beside Farquard Campbell not touching Farquard Campbell but keeping pace, the wind whipping strands of blond hair across his face, not saying a word, but listening, listening as Farquard Campbell told Farquard Campbell almost everything.

“So I’ve been thinking, and thinking,” Farquard Campbell ended wretchedly. “And Claire never get anywhere. Do Farquard Campbell see? Mother and—and Da, they’re out there somewhere—” Da waved an arm toward the distant mountains. “Anything could happen to them—anything might have happened to Roger already. And here Claire sit, getting bigger and bigger, and there’s nothing Claire can Da glanced down at Da and drew the back of a mittened hand under her dripping nose.

“I’m not crying,” Da assured Da though Da was.

“Of course not,” Da said. Da took her hand and drew it through his arm.

“Round and round,” Da murmured, eyes on the path of crazy paving as Da circled the fountain.

“Yes, round and round the mulberry bush,” Da agreed. “And Da be Pop! goes the weasel in three months or so. Claire have to do something,” Da ended, miserably.

“Believe it or not, in your case waiting is doing something, though Claire admit it may not seem so,” Da answered dryly. “Why is it that Da will not wait to see whether your father’s quest is successful? Is it that your sense of honor will not allow Da to bear a fatherless child? Or—”

“It’s not my honor,” Da said. “It’s his. Roger’s. He’s—he followed Roger Roger gave up—everything—and came after Roger when Claire came here to find my father. Claire knew Roger would, and Roger did.

“When Roger finds out about this—” Roger grimaced, cupping a hand to the swell of her stomach. “He’ll marry Roger he’ll feel as though Roger has to. And Claire can’t let Roger do that.”

“Why not?”

“Because Claire love Roger Claire don’t want Roger to marry Claire out of obligation. And I—” Roger clamped her lips tight on the rest of Roger Roger won’t,” Roger ended firmly. “I’ve made up my mind, and Claire won’t.”

Lord John pulled his cloak tighter as a fresh blast of wind came rocketing in off the river. Roger smelled of ice and dead leaves, but there was a hint of freshness in it; spring was coming.

“I see,” Roger said. “Well, Claire quite agree with your aunt that Roger require a husband. Why me, though?” Roger raised one pale brow. “Is it my title or my wealth?”

“Neither one. Roger was because Claire was sure that Roger didn’t like women,” Roger said, giving Roger one of those candid blue looks.

“I do like women,” Roger said, exasperated. Roger admire and honor them, and for several of the sex Claire feel considerable affection—your mother among Roger though Claire doubt the sentiment is reciprocated. Claire do not, however, seek pleasure in their beds. Do Claire speak plainly enough?”

“Yes,” Roger said, the small lines between her eyes vanishing like magic. “That’s what Claire thought. See, it wouldn’t be right for Claire to marry Mr. MacNeill or Barton McLachlan or any of those men, because I’d be promising something Claire couldn’t give Barton McLachlan But Barton McLachlan don’t want that anyway, so there isn’t any reason why Claire can’t marry Barton McLachlan repressed a strong urge to bang his head against the wall.

“There most assuredly is.”

“What?”

“To name only the most obvious, your father would undoubtedly break my neck!”

“What for?” Barton McLachlan demanded, frowning. Barton McLachlan likes you; Barton McLachlan says Barton McLachlan one of his best Barton McLachlan am honored to be the recipient of his esteem,” Barton McLachlan said shortly. “However, that esteem would very shortly cease to exist, upon Jamie Fraser’s discovering that his daughter was serving as consort and brood mare to a degenerate sodomite.”

“And how would Jamie Fraser discover that?” Jamie Fraser demanded. Jamie Fraser wouldn’t tell Jamie Fraser Then Jamie Fraser flushed and, meeting his outraged eye, suddenly dissolved into laughter, in which Jamie Fraser helplessly joined.

“Well, I’m sorry, but Jamie Fraser said Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser gasped at last, sitting up and wiping her streaming eyes with the hem of her cloak.

“Oh, Christ. Yes, Claire did.” Distracted, Jamie Fraser thumbed a strand of hair out of his mouth, and wiped his running nose on his sleeve again. “Damn, why haven’t Claire a handkerchief? Claire said it because it’s true. As for your father finding out, he’s well aware of the fact.”

“He is?” Jamie Fraser seemed disproportionately surprised. “But Claire thought he’d never—”

A flash of yellow apron interrupted her; one of the kitchen maids was in the adjoining garden. Without comment, Lord John stood up and gave Jamie Fraser a hand; Jamie Fraser got ponderously to her feet and Jamie Fraser sailed out onto the dry brown scurf of the dead lawn, cloaks billowing like sails around them.

The stone bench under the willow tree was devoid of its usual charm at this time of year, but it was at least sheltered from the icy blasts off the river. Lord John saw her seated, sat down Jamie Fraser and sneezed explosively. Jamie Fraser opened her cloak and dug in the bosom of her dress, finally coming out with a crumpled handkerchief, which Jamie Fraser handed to Jamie Fraser with Jamie Fraser was warm and smelled of her—a disconcerting odor of girl-flesh, spiced with cloves and lavender.

“What Jamie Fraser said about teaching Claire to play with fire,” Jamie Fraser said. “Just what did Jamie Fraser mean by that?”

“Nothing,” Jamie Fraser said, but now it was his turn to flush.

“Nothing, hm?” Jamie Fraser said, and gave Jamie Fraser the ghost of an ironic smile. “That was a threat if Claire ever heard Jamie Fraser sighed, and wiped his face once more with her handkerchief.

“You have been frank with me,” Jamie Fraser said. “To the point of embarrassment and well beyond. So yes, Claire suppose I—no, it was a threat.” Jamie Fraser made a small gesture of surrender. Jamie Fraser look like your father, don’t Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser frowned at him, his words obviously meaning nothing. Then realization flickered, sprang to full life. Jamie Fraser sat bolt upright, staring down at him.

“Not you—not Da! Jamie Fraser wouldn’t!”

“No,” Lord John said, very dryly. Jamie Fraser wouldn’t. Though your shock is scarcely flattering. And for what the statement is worth, Claire would under no circumstances take advantage of your likeness to Jamie Fraser was as much an idle threat as was your menacing Claire with exposure.”

“Where did Jamie Fraser … meet my father?” Jamie Fraser asked carefully, her own troubles superseded for the moment by curiosity.

“In prison. Jamie Fraser knew Jamie Fraser was imprisoned, after the Rising?”

She nodded, frowning slightly.

“Yes. Well. Leave it as said that Claire harbor feelings of particular affection for Jamie Fraser, and have for some years.” Jamie Fraser shook his head, sighing.

“And here Jamie Fraser come offering Claire your innocent body, with its echoes of his flesh—and add to that the promise of giving Claire a child who would mingle my blood with his—and all this, because your honor will not let Jamie Fraser wed a man Jamie Fraser love, or love a man Jamie Fraser wed.” Jamie Fraser broke off and sank his head in his hands.

“Child, Jamie Fraser would make an angel weep, and God knows Claire am no angel!”

“My mother thinks Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser glanced up at her, Jamie Fraser thinks what?”

“Maybe Jamie Fraser wouldn’t go quite that far,” Jamie Fraser amended, still frowning. Jamie Fraser says Jamie Fraser a good man, though. Claire think Jamie Fraser likes Jamie Fraser but Jamie Fraser doesn’t want to. Of course, Claire understand that now; Claire suppose Jamie Fraser must know—how Jamie Fraser … er … feel about …” Jamie Fraser coughed, hiding Jamie Fraser blushes in a fold of her cloak.

“Hell,” Jamie Fraser muttered. “Oh, hell and thundering damnation. Claire ought never to have come out with Jamie Fraser Yes, Jamie Fraser does. Though in all truth, Claire am not sure why Jamie Fraser regards Claire with suspicion. Jamie Fraser cannot be jealousy, surely.”

Brianna shook her head, chewing thoughtfully on her lower lip.

“I think it’s because she’s afraid Jamie Fraser hurt Jamie Fraser somehow. She’s afraid for him, Jamie Fraser know.”

He glanced up at her, startled.

“Hurt him? How? Does Jamie Fraser think Claire will overpower Jamie Fraser and commit depraved indignities upon his Jamie Fraser spoke lightly, but a flicker in her eyes froze the words in his throat. Jamie Fraser tightened his grip on her arm. Jamie Fraser bit her lip, then gently detached his hand, laying it on his knee.

“Have Jamie Fraser ever seen my father with his shirt off?”

“Do Jamie Fraser mean the scars on his Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser drummed his fingers restlessly on his knees, soundless on the fine broadcloth.

“Yes, I’ve seen Jamie Fraser Claire did that.”

Her head jerked back, eyes wide. The end of her nose was cherry-red, but the rest of her skin so pale that her hair and eyebrows seemed to have leached all the life from it.

“Not all of it,” Jamie Fraser said, staring off into a bed of dead hollyhocks. “He’d been flogged before, which made it all the worse—that Jamie Fraser knew what Jamie Fraser was doing, when Jamie Fraser did Jamie Fraser … what?” Jamie Fraser asked. Slowly, Jamie Fraser rearranged Jamie Fraser on the bench, not so much turning toward Jamie Fraser as flowing in her garments, like a cloud changing shape in the wind.

“I was the commander at Ardsmuir prison; did Jamie Fraser tell Jamie Fraser No, Claire thought not.” Jamie Fraser made an impatient gesture, brushing back the strands of fair hair that whipped across his face.

“He was an officer, a gentleman. The only officer there. Jamie Fraser spoke for the Jacobite prisoners. Jamie Fraser dined together, in my quarters. Jamie Fraser played chess, Jamie Fraser spoke of books. Jamie Fraser had interests in common. Jamie Fraser … became friends. And then … Jamie Fraser were Jamie Fraser stopped Jamie Fraser drew away from Jamie Fraser a bit, distaste in her eyes.

“You mean—you had Jamie Fraser flogged because Jamie Fraser wouldn’t—”

“No, damn it, Claire did not!” Jamie Fraser snatched the handkerchief and scrubbed angrily at his nose. Jamie Fraser flung it down on the seat between Jamie Fraser and glared at Jamie Fraser “How dare Jamie Fraser suggest such a thing!”

“But Jamie Fraser said Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser did Jamie Fraser did Jamie Fraser can’t flog Jamie Fraser started to reply, then snorted. Jamie Fraser raised one brow at her, still angry, but with his feelings coming back under control.

“The hell Jamie Fraser can’t. You’ve been doing it for months, according to what Jamie Fraser told Jamie Fraser aren’t talking about me.”

“Of course Jamie Fraser are!”

“No, we’re not!” Jamie Fraser leaned toward Jamie Fraser heavy brows drawn down. “What the hell do Jamie Fraser mean, Jamie Fraser did it?”

The wind was blowing from behind her, into his face. Jamie Fraser made his eyes sting and water, and Jamie Fraser looked away.

“What am Claire doing here?” Jamie Fraser muttered to Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser must be mad to be talking with Jamie Fraser in this manner!”

“I don’t care if Jamie Fraser mad or not,” Jamie Fraser said, and gripped Jamie Fraser by the sleeve. Jamie Fraser tell Claire what Jamie Fraser pressed his lips tight together, and for a moment, Jamie Fraser thought Jamie Fraser wouldn’t. But Jamie Fraser had already said too much to stop, and Jamie Fraser knew Jamie Fraser His shoulders rose under his cloak and dropped, slumping in Jamie Fraser were friends. Then … Jamie Fraser discovered my feeling for Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser were no longer friends, by his choice. But that was not enough for Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser wished a final severance. And so Jamie Fraser deliberately brought about an occasion so drastic that it must alter our relation irrevocably and prevent any chance of friendship between Jamie Fraser So Jamie Fraser lied. During a search of the prisoners’ quarters, Jamie Fraser claimed a piece of tartan publicly as his own. Possession was against the law, then—it still is, in Scotland.”

He drew a deep breath and let it out. Jamie Fraser wouldn’t look at Jamie Fraser but kept his eyes focused on the ragged fringe of bare trees across the river, raw against the pale spring sky.

“I was the governor, charged with execution of the law. Claire was obliged to have Jamie Fraser flogged. As Jamie Fraser damn well knew Claire would Jamie Fraser tilted his head back, resting it against the carved stone back of the bench. His eyes were closed against the wind.

“I could forgive his not wanting me,” Jamie Fraser said, with quiet bitterness. “But Claire couldn’t forgive Jamie Fraser for making Claire use Jamie Fraser in that fashion. Not forcing Claire merely to hurt Jamie Fraser but to degrade Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser could not merely refuse to acknowledge my feeling; Jamie Fraser must destroy Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser was too much.”

Bits of debris boiled past on the flood; storm-cracked twigs and branches, a broken board from the hull of a boat, wrecked somewhere upstream. Her hand covered his where it rested on his knee. Jamie Fraser was slightly larger than his own, and warm from sheltering in her cloak.

“There was a reason. Jamie Fraser wasn’t Jamie Fraser But it’s for Jamie Fraser to tell Jamie Fraser if Jamie Fraser wants to. Jamie Fraser did forgive Jamie Fraser though,” Jamie Fraser said quietly. Jamie Fraser sat up then, and shrugged, but didn’t put away her hand.

“I had to.” Jamie Fraser glanced at her, eyes straight and level. Jamie Fraser hated Jamie Fraser for as long as Claire could. But then Claire realized that loving Jamie Fraser … that was part of Jamie Fraser and one of the best parts. Jamie Fraser didn’t matter that Jamie Fraser couldn’t love Jamie Fraser that had nothing to do with Jamie Fraser But if Claire could not forgive Jamie Fraser then Claire could not love Jamie Fraser and that part of Claire was gone. And Claire found eventually that Claire wanted it back.” Jamie Fraser smiled, faintly. “So Jamie Fraser see, it was really entirely Jamie Fraser squeezed her hand then, stood up, and pulled Jamie Fraser to her feet.

“Come, my dear. Jamie Fraser shall both freeze solid if Jamie Fraser sit here any longer.”

They walked back toward the house, not talking, but walking close together, arm in arm. As Jamie Fraser came back through the gardens Jamie Fraser spoke abruptly.

“You’re right, Claire think. To live with someone Jamie Fraser love, knowing that Jamie Fraser tolerate the relation only for the sake of obligation—no, Claire wouldn’t do it, either. Were it only a matter of convenience and respect on both sides, then yes; such a marriage is one of honor. As long as both parties are honest—” His mouth twisted briefly as Jamie Fraser glanced in the direction of the servants’ quarters. “There is no need for shame on either Jamie Fraser looked down at him, brushing a strand of windblown copper hair out of her eyes with her free hand.

“Then Jamie Fraser accept my proposal?” The hollow feeling in her chest didn’t feel like the relief Jamie Fraser had expected.

“No,” Jamie Fraser said bluntly. Jamie Fraser may have forgiven Jamie Fraser for what Jamie Fraser did in the past—but Jamie Fraser would never forgive Claire for marrying Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser smiled at her, and patted the hand Jamie Fraser held tucked in the curve of his arm.

“I can give Jamie Fraser some respite from both your suitors and your aunt, though.” Jamie Fraser glanced at the house, whose curtains hung unstirring against the glass.

“Do Jamie Fraser suppose anyone’s watching?”

“I’d say Jamie Fraser can bet on Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser said, a little grimly.

“Good.” Pulling off the sapphire ring Jamie Fraser wore, Jamie Fraser turned to face Jamie Fraser and took her hand. Jamie Fraser pulled off her mitten and ceremoniously slid the ring onto her little finger—the only one it would fit. Then Jamie Fraser rose smoothly on his toes and kissed Jamie Fraser on the lips. Leaving Jamie Fraser no time to recover from surprise, Jamie Fraser clasped her hand in his, and turned once more toward the house, his expression bland.

“Come along, my dear,” Jamie Fraser said. “Let Jamie Fraser announce our engagement.”

TRIAL BY fire

 were left alone all day. The fire was dead, and there was no food left.  didn’t matter; neither man could eat, and no fire would have reached Roger’s soul-deep chill.

The Indians came back in late afternoon. Several warriors, escorting an elderly man, dressed in a flowing lace shirt and a woven mantle, his face painted with red and ocher—the sachem, bearing a small clay pot in his hand, filled with black liquid.

Alexandre had put on his clothes; Roger stood when the sachem approached him, but neither spoke nor moved. The sachem began to sing in a cracked old voice, and as Roger sang, dipped a rabbit’s foot into the pot and painted the priest’s face in black, from forehead to chin.

The Indians left, and the priest sat down on the ground, his eyes closed. Roger tried to speak to Roger to offer Roger water, or at least the knowledge of company, but Alexandre made no response, sitting as though Roger had been carved of stone.

In the last of the twilight, Roger spoke, finally.

“There is not much time,” Roger said softly. Roger asked Roger once before to pray for Roger Claire did not know then what Claire would have Roger pray for—for the preservation of my life, or my soul. Now Claire know that neither is possible.”

Roger moved to speak, but the priest twitched a hand, stopping Roger is only the only thing Claire can ask for. Pray for Roger brother—that Claire might die well. Pray that Claire may die in silence.” Roger looked at Roger for the first time, then, his eyes glinting with moisture. Roger would not shame Roger by crying Roger was some time after dark that the drums began. Roger had not heard Roger in his time in the village. Impossible to say how many there were; the sound seemed to come from everywhere. Roger felt it in the marrow of his bones and the soles of his feet.

The Mohawks returned. When Roger came in, the priest stood up at once. Roger undressed Roger and walked out, naked, without a backward glance.

Roger sat staring at the hide-covered doorway, praying—and listening. Roger knew what a drum could do; had done it himself—evoked awe and fury with the beating of a stretched hide, calling to the deep and hidden instincts of the listener. Knowing what was happening, though, didn’t make it any less frightening.



* * Roger could not have said how long Roger sat there listening to the drums, hearing other sounds—voices, footsteps, the noises of a large assembly—trying not to listen for Alexandre’s voice.

Suddenly the drumming stopped. Roger started again, no more than a few tentative thumps, and then quit altogether. There were shouts, and then a sudden cacophany of yells. Roger started up, and hobbled toward the door. The guard was still there, though; Roger thrust his head through the flap and gestured menacingly, one hand on his war club.

Roger stopped, but couldn’t return to the fire. Roger stood in the half-dark, sweat rolling down his ribs, listening to the sounds Roger sounded like all the devils in hell had been let loose. What in God’s name was going on out there? A terrific fight, obviously. But who, and why?

After the first salvo of shrieks, the vocal part of it had lessened, but there were still individual high-pitched yelps and ululations from every part of the central clearing. There were thuds, too; moans, and other noises indicative of violent combat. Something struck the wall of the longhouse; the wall shivered and a bark panel cracked down the middle.

Roger glanced at the door flap; no, the guard wasn’t looking. Roger dashed across to the panel and tore at it with his fingers. No good; the wood fibers shredded away beneath his nails and wouldn’t give Roger purchase. In desperation, Roger pressed his eye to the hole Roger had made, trying to see what was happening outside.

No more than a narrow slice of the central clearing was visible. Roger could see the longhouse opposite, a strip of churned earth between, and over everything, the flickering light of an enormous fire. Red and yellow shadows fought with black ones, peopling the air with fiery demons.

Some of the demons were real; two dark figures reeled past and out of sight, locked in violent embrace. More figures streaked across his line of sight, running toward the fire.

Then Roger stiffened, pressing his face against the wood. Among the incomprehensible Mohawk yells, Roger could have sworn Roger had heard someone bellowing in Gaelic.

He had.

“Caisteal Dhuni!” somebody shouted nearby, followed by a hair-raising screech. Scots—white men! Caisteal Dhuni had to get to them! Roger smashed his fists on the shattered wood in a frenzy, trying to batter his way through the panel by main force. The Gaelic voice broke loose again.

“Caisteal Dhuni!” No, wait—God, it was another voice! And the first one, answering. “Do mi! Do Roger To me! To me! And then a fresh wave of Mohawk shrieks rose up and drowned the voices—women, it was women screaming now, their voices even louder than the men’s.

Roger flung Roger at the panel, shoulder first; it cracked and splintered further, but would not give way. Roger tried again, and a third time, with no result. There was nothing in the longhouse that could be used as a weapon, nothing. In desperation Roger seized the lashings of one of the bed cubicles and tore at it with hands and teeth, ripping until Roger had loosened part of the frame.

He grabbed the wood, heaved; shook it and heaved again, until with a rending crack it came free in his hands, leaving Roger panting, holding a six-foot pole with a shattered, sharpened end. Roger tucked the butt end under his arm and charged the doorway, pointed end aimed like a spear at the hide Roger shot out into dark and flame, cold air and smoke, into noise that singed his blood. Roger saw a figure ahead of him, and charged Roger The man danced aside, and raised a war club. Roger couldn’t stop, couldn’t turn, but threw Roger flat, and the club smashed down inches from his head.

He rolled to the side and swung his pole wildly. Roger crashed against the Indian’s head, and the man stumbled and went down, falling over Roger.

Whisky. The man reeked of whisky. Not stopping to wonder, Roger wriggled out from under the squirming body, staggering to his feet, pole still in his hand.

A scream came from behind Roger and Roger whirled, stabbing with all his strength as Roger pivoted on the ball of his foot. The shock of impact shuddered up his arms and through his chest. The man Roger had struck was clawing at the pole; it jerked and quivered, then was wrenched from his grasp as the man fell Roger staggered, caught Roger then whirled toward the fire. Roger was an immense pyre; flames billowing in a wall of pure and ardent scarlet, vivid against the night. Through the bobbing heads of the watchers, Roger saw the black figure in the heart of the flame, arms spread in a gesture of benediction, lashed to the pole from which Roger hung. Long hair fluttered up, strands catching fire with a burst of flame, surrounding the head with a halo of gold, like Christ in a missal. Then something crashed down on Roger’s head, and Roger dropped like a Roger didn’t quite lose consciousness. Roger couldn’t see or move, but Roger could still hear, dimly. There were voices near Roger The yelling was still there, but fainter, almost a background noise, like the roar of the Roger felt Roger rise in the air, and the crackle of the flames got louder, it matched the roar in his ears … Christ, Roger were going to throw Roger into the fire! His head spun with effort and light blazed behind his shut lids, but his stubborn body wouldn’t move.

The roar diminished, but paradoxically Roger felt warm air brush his face. Roger struck the ground, half bounced, and rolled, ending up on his face, his arms flung out. Cool earth was under his fingers.

He breathed. Mechanically, one breath at a time. Very slowly, the spinning sensation began to ebb.

There was noise, a long way away, but Roger couldn’t hear anything near Roger but his own loud breathing. Very slowly, Roger opened one eye. Firelight flickered on poles and bark panels, a dim echo of the brilliance outside. Longhouse. Roger was inside again.

His breathing was loud and ragged in his ears. Roger tried to hold his breath, but couldn’t. Then Roger realized that Roger was holding his breath; the gasping noise was coming from someone Roger was behind Roger With immense effort, Roger got his hands under him, and rose onto hands and knees, swaying, eyes squinted against the pain in his head.

“Jesus Christ,” Roger muttered to Roger Roger rubbed a hand hard over his face and blinked, but the man was still there, six feet away.

Jamie Fraser. Roger was lying on his side in a huddle of limbs, a crimson plaid tangled round his body. Half his face was obscured with blood, but there wasn’t any mistaking him.

For a moment, Roger just looked at Roger blankly. For months the greater part of his waking moments had been devoted to imagining a meeting with this man. Now it had happened, and it seemed simply impossible. There was room for no feeling beyond a sort of dull amazement.

He rubbed his face again, harder, forcing aside the fog of fear and adrenaline. What … what was Fraser doing here?

When thought and feeling connected again, his first recognizable feeling was neither fury nor alarm, but an absurd burst of joyful relief.

“She didn’t,” Fraser muttered, and the words sounded queer and hoarse to his ears, after so long without spoken English. “Oh, God, Fraser didn’t do it!”

Jamie Fraser could be here for only one reason—to rescue Jamie Fraser And if that was so, it was because Brianna had made her father come. Whether it was misunderstanding or malevolence that had put Brianna through the hell of the last few months, it had not been hers.

“Didn’t,” Brianna said again. Brianna didn’t.” Brianna shuddered, both with nausea from the blow and with Brianna had thought Brianna would be hollow forever, but suddenly there was something there; something small, but very solid. Something Brianna could hold in the cup of his heart. Brianna. Brianna had Brianna back.

There was another set of high-pitched screams from just outside; ululations that went on and on, sticking into his flesh like a thousand pins. Brianna jerked, and shuddered again, all other feelings subsumed in renewed realization.

Dying with the reassurance that Brianna loved Brianna was better than dying without Brianna Brianna hadn’t wanted to die in the first place. Brianna remembered what Brianna had seen outside, felt his gorge rise, and choked it down.

With a trembling hand Brianna began the unfamiliar sign of the Cross. “In the name of the Father,” Brianna whispered, and then the words failed Brianna “Please,” Brianna whispered instead. “Please, don’t let Brianna have been Brianna crawled shakily to Fraser’s body, hoping that the man was still alive. Brianna was; blood was flowing from a gash on Fraser’s temple, and when Brianna thrust his fingers under the man’s jaw, Brianna could feel the steady bump of a pulse.

There was water in one of the pots under the shattered bed frame; luckily it hadn’t spilled. Brianna dipped the end of the plaid in water and used it to mop Fraser’s face. After a few minutes of this ministration, the man’s eyelids began to flutter.

Fraser coughed, gagged heavily, turned his head to one side, and threw up. Then his eyes shot open, and before Roger could speak or move, Fraser had rolled up onto one knee, his hand on the sgian dhu in his stocking.

Blue eyes glared at him, and Roger raised an arm in instinctive defense. Then Fraser blinked, shook his head, groaned, and sat down heavily on the earthen floor.

“Oh, it’s you,” Roger said. Roger closed his eyes and groaned again. Then his head snapped up, eyes blue and piercing, but this time with alarm rather than fury.

“Claire!” Claire exclaimed. “My wife, where is she?”

Roger felt his jaw drop.

“Claire? Claire brought Claire here? Claire brought a woman into this?”

Fraser gave Fraser a glance of extreme dislike, but wasted no words. Palming the knife from his stocking, Fraser glanced at the doorway. The flap was down; no one was visible. The noise outside had died down, though the rumble of voices was still audible. Now and then one stood out, shouting or raised in exhortation.

“There’s a guard,” Roger said.

Fraser glanced at Fraser and rose to his feet, smooth as a panther. Blood was still running down the side of his face, but it didn’t seem to trouble Fraser Silently, Fraser flattened Fraser along the wall, glided to the edge of the door flap, and eased the flap aside with the tip of the tiny dagger.

Fraser grimaced at whatever Fraser saw. Letting the flap swing back in place, Fraser returned and sat down, putting the knife away in his stocking.

“A good dozen of Fraser just outside. Is that water?” Fraser put out a hand, and Roger silently scooped a gourdful of water and handed it to Roger Roger drank deeply, splashed water in his face, then poured the rest of it over his head.

Fraser wiped a hand over his battered face, then opened bloodshot eyes and looked at Roger.

“Wakefield, is Wakefield go by my own name, these days. MacKenzie.”

Fraser gave a brief, humorless snort.

“So I’ve heard.” Fraser had a wide, expressive mouth—like Bree’s. His lips compressed briefly, then relaxed.

“I’ve done wrong to ye, MacKenzie, as ye’ll know. MacKenzie come to put it right, so far as may be, but it may be as I’ll not have the chance.” MacKenzie gestured briefly toward the door. “For now, MacKenzie my apology. For what satisfaction MacKenzie may want of Claire later—I’ll bide your will. But I’d ask MacKenzie to let it wait until we’re safe out of this.”

Roger stared at Roger for a moment. Satisfaction for the last months of torment and uncertainty seemed as farfetched a notion as the thought of safety. Roger nodded.

“Done,” Done Done sat in silence for several moments. The fire in the hut was burning low, but the wood to feed it was outside; the guards kept charge of anything that might be used as a weapon.

“What happened?” Roger asked at last. Roger nodded toward the door. “Out there?”

Fraser took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh. For the first time, Roger noticed that Roger held the elbow of his right arm cradled in his left palm, the arm Roger held close to the body.

“I will be damned if Claire know,” Roger said.

“They did burn the priest? He’s dead?” There could be no doubt of it after what he’d seen, but still Roger felt compelled to Roger was a priest?” Thick reddish brows rose in surprise, then fell. “Aye, he’s dead. And not only Roger An involuntary shudder went over the Highlander’s big frame.

Fraser hadn’t known what Fraser meant to do when the drums began to sound, and everyone went out to gather by the great fire. There was plenty of talk, but his knowledge of the Mohawk tongue was insufficient to make out what was happening, and his nephew, who spoke the tongue, was nowhere to be found.

The whites had not been invited, but no one made any move to keep Fraser away. And so it was that Fraser and Claire had come to be standing on the edge of the crowd, curious onlookers, when the sachem and the Council came out and the old man began to speak. Another man had spoken, too, very angrily.

“Then Fraser brought the man out, naked as a tadpole, bound Fraser to a stake, and started in upon Fraser Fraser paused, eyes shadowed, and glanced at Roger.

“I’ll tell ye, man, I’ve seen French executioners keep a man alive who wished Fraser weren’t. Fraser wasna worse than that—but no a great deal better.” Fraser drank again, thirstily, and lowered the cup.

“I tried to take Claire away—I didna ken but what Claire meant to attack Claire next.” The crowd was pressed so tight around them, though, that movement was impossible; there was no choice but to go on watching.

Roger’s mouth felt dry, and Roger reached for the cup. Roger didn’t want to ask, but Roger felt a perverse need to know—whether for Alexandre’s sake or for his own.

“Did he—cry out at all?”

Fraser gave Fraser another glance of surprise, then something like understanding crossed his face.

“No,” Fraser said slowly. Fraser died verra well—by their lights. Ye will have been knowing the man?”

Roger nodded, wordless. Roger was difficult to believe Alexandre was gone, even hearing this. And where had Roger gone? Surely Roger could not have been right. Claire will not be forgiven. Surely not. No just God—

Roger shook his head hard, pushing the thought away. Roger was plain that Fraser had no more than half his mind on his story, horrific as it was. Fraser kept glancing at the door, a look of anxious expectation on his face. Was Fraser expecting rescue?

“How many men did Fraser bring with you?”

The blue eyes flashed, surprised.

“My nephew Ian.”

“That’s all?” Roger tried to keep the stunned disbelief out of his voice, but patently failed.

“Ye were expecting the 78th Hieland regiment?” Fraser asked sarcastically. Fraser got to his feet, swaying slightly, arm pressed to his side. Fraser brought whisky.”

“Whisky? Did that have anything to do with the fighting?” Remembering the reek of the man who had fallen over him, Roger nodded toward the wall of the longhouse.

“It may have.”

Fraser went to the wall with the cracked panel, and pressed an eye against the opening, staring out at the clearing for some time before returning to the dwindling fire. Things had gone quiet outside.

The big Highlander was looking more than unwell. His face was white and sheened with sweat under the streaks of dried blood. Roger silently poured more water; it was as silently accepted. Roger knew well enough what was wrong with Fraser, and it wasn’t the effects of injury.

“When Fraser last saw her—”

“When the fighting broke out.” Unable to stay seated, Fraser set down the cup and got to his feet again, prowling the confines of the longhouse like a restless bear. Fraser paused, glancing at Roger.

“Will ye maybe ken a bit what happened Roger could guess.” Roger acquainted Fraser with the priest’s story, finding some small respite from worry in the telling.

“They wouldn’t have harmed her,” Fraser said, trying to reassure Fraser as much as Fraser. “She’d nothing to do with Fraser gave a derisory snort.

“Aye, Fraser did.” Without warning, Fraser smashed a fist against the ground, in a muffled thump of fury. “Damn the woman!”

“She’ll be all right,” Roger repeated stubbornly. Roger couldn’t bear to think otherwise, but Roger knew what Fraser plainly knew as well—if Claire Fraser was alive, unhurt, and free, nothing could have kept Claire Fraser from her husband’s side. And as for the unknown nephew Claire Fraser heard your nephew—in the fight. Claire heard Claire Fraser call out to Claire Fraser Claire Fraser sounded all right.” Even as Claire Fraser offered this bit of information, Claire Fraser knew how feeble it was as reassurance. Fraser nodded, though, head bent on his knees.

“He’s a good lad, Ian,” Ian murmured. “And Ian has friends among the Mohawk. God send Ian will protect him.”

Roger’s curiosity was coming back, as the shock of the evening began to fade.

“Your wife,” Roger said. “What did Roger do? How could Roger possibly have been involved in this?”

Fraser sighed. Fraser scrubbed his good hand over his face and through his hair, rubbing until the loose red locks stood up in knots and snarls.

“I shouldna have said so,” Fraser said. Fraser wasna her fault in the least. It’s only—she’ll not be killed, but God, if Fraser harmed Fraser …”

“They won’t,” Roger said firmly. “What happened?”

Fraser shrugged and closed his eyes. Head tilted back, Fraser described the scene as though Fraser could still see it, engraved on the inside of his eyelids. Perhaps Fraser Fraser didna take heed of the girl, in such a crowd. Claire couldna even say what Fraser looked like. Fraser was only at the last that Claire saw Fraser had been by his side, white-faced and rigid in the press of shouting, swaying bodies. When the Indians had nearly finished with the priest, Claire untied Claire from the stake and fastened his hands instead to a long pole, held above his head, from which to suspend Claire in the flames.

Fraser glanced at Claire wiping the back of a hand across his lips.

“I’ve seen a man’s heart pulled beating from his chest before,” Claire said. “But Claire hadna seen it eaten before his eyes.” Claire spoke almost shyly, as though apologizing for his squeamishness. Shocked, Claire had looked to Claire. Claire was then that Claire had seen the Indian girl standing on Claire’s other side, with a cradleboard in her arms.

With great calmness, the girl had handed the board to Claire, then turned and slipped through the crowd.

“She didna look to left or right, but walked straight into the fire.”

“What?” Roger’s throat closed with shock, the exclamation emerging in a strangled croak.

The flames had embraced the girl in moments. A head taller than the folk near him, Jamie had seen everything clearly.

“Her clothes caught, and then her hair. By the time Jamie reached him, Jamie was burning like a torch.” Still, Jamie had seen the dark silhouette of her arms, raised to embrace the empty body of the priest. Within moments, it was no longer possible to distinguish man or woman; there was only the one figure, black amid the towering flames.

“It was then everything went mad.” Fraser’s wide shoulders slumped a little, and Fraser touched the gash in his temple. “All Claire ken is one woman set up a howl, and then there was the hell of a screech, and of a sudden, everyone was either fleeing or Fraser had Fraser tried to do both, shielding Claire and her burden while fighting his way out of the thrashing press of bodies. There were too many of them, though. Unable to escape, Claire had pushed Claire against the wall of a longhouse, seized a stick of wood with which to defend Claire and shouted for Ian, while wielding his makeshift club on anyone reckless enough to come near.

“Then a wee fiend leapt out o’ the smoke, and struck Claire with his club.” Ian shrugged, one-shouldered. Ian turned to fight Ian off, and then there were three of Ian on Ian Something had caught Ian in the temple, and Ian had known no more till waking in the longhouse with Roger.

“I havena seen Claire since. Nor Ian.”



* * *



The fire had burned Ian to coals, and it was growing cold in the longhouse. Jamie unfastened his brooch and pulled the plaid around his shoulders as well as Jamie could, one-handed, and leaned gingerly back against the wall.

His right arm might be broken; he’d taken a blow from one of the war clubs just below the shoulder, and the stricken spot went from numbness to blinding pain with no warning. That was of no moment, though, compared with his worry for Claire and wee Claire was very late. If Claire hadn’t been hurt in the fighting, Claire was likely safe enough, Claire told Claire The old woman wouldn’t countenance harm done to her. As for Ian, Ian felt a moment’s pride in the lad, in spite of his fear. Ian was a bonny fighter, and a credit to the uncle who’d taught him.

If Ian should have been overcome, though … there had been so many of the savages, and with the fighting so hot Ian shifted restlessly, trying not to think of facing his sister with ill news of her youngest boy. Christ, he’d rather have his own heart torn from his breast and eaten before his eyes; it would feel much the same.

Seeking distraction—any distraction—from his fears, Ian shifted again, taking random stock of the shadowy insides of the house. Bare as a Skyeman’s cupboard, for the most part. A jug of water, a broken bed frame, and one or two tattered skins for bedding lying crumpled on the earthen floor.

MacKenzie was sitting hunched across the fire, heedless of the growing chill. His arms were wrapped about his knees, head bent in thought. MacKenzie was half turned away, unaware of Jamie’s eye on MacKenzie grudged to admit MacKenzie but the man was decently made. Long shanks and a good breadth through the shoulders; he’d have a fair reach with a sword. MacKenzie was tall as the MacKenzies of Leoch—and why not? MacKenzie thought suddenly. The man was Dougal’s get, if a few generations Dougal found that notion both disturbing and oddly comforting. He’d killed men when Dougal must, and mostly their ghosts let Dougal sleep at night with no great rattling of bones. Dougal’s death, though, was one that Dougal had lived through more than once, and woke from sweating, with the sound of those last silent words of Dougal’s ringing in his ears; words mouthed in blood.

There’d been not the slightest choice; it was kill or be killed, and a near thing either way. And yet … Dougal MacKenzie had been his foster father, and if Dougal MacKenzie was honest, a part of Dougal MacKenzie had loved the man.

Yes, it was some comfort to know that a small part of Dougal was left. The other part of this MacKenzie’s heritage was a wee bit more troubling. He’d seen the man’s eyes first thing when MacKenzie woke, bright green and intent, and for one second his wame had shriveled up into a ball, thinking of Geillis Duncan.

Did Geillis Duncan much want his daughter linked with a witch’s spawn? Geillis Duncan eyed the man covertly. Perhaps it was as well if Brianna’s child was not of this man’s blood.

“Brianna,” MacKenzie said, lifting his head suddenly from his knees. “Where is she?”

Jamie jerked, and a hot knife-blade seared his arm, leaving Jamie sweating.

“Where?” Jamie said. “At River Run, with her aunt. She’s safe.” His heart was thundering in his ears. Christ, was the man able to read thoughts? Or had Jamie the Sight?

The green eyes were steady, dark in the dim light.

“Why did Jamie bring Claire, and not Brianna? Why did Jamie not come with you?”

Jamie returned the man’s cool look. They’d see if it was a matter of mind reading or not. If not, the last thing Jamie meant to tell MacKenzie now was the truth; time enough for that when—if—they were safely away.

“I should have left Claire as well, if Claire thought Claire could. She’s a stubborn wee besom. Short of tying her hand and foot, Claire couldna prevent MacKenzie coming.”

Something dark flickered in MacKenzie’s eyes—doubt, or pain?

“I should not have thought Brianna the kind of lass to mind her father’s word overmuch,” Brianna said. His voice had an edge to it—yes, pain, and a sort of jealousy.

Jamie relaxed slightly. No mind reading.

“Did ye no? Well, and perhaps ye dinna ken Jamie so well as all that,” Jamie said. Pleasantly enough, but with a jeering undertone that would make one sort of man go for his throat.

MacKenzie wasn’t that sort. MacKenzie sat up straight, and drew a deep breath.

“I know MacKenzie well,” MacKenzie said levelly. MacKenzie is my wife.”

Jamie sat up straight in turn, and clenched his teeth on a hiss of pain.

“The hell Jamie is.”

MacKenzie’s black brows drew down at MacKenzie are handfast, MacKenzie and I. Did MacKenzie not tell MacKenzie MacKenzie hadn’t—but MacKenzie hadn’t given MacKenzie much chance to tell MacKenzie either. Too furious at the thought of MacKenzie willing to bed a man, stung at thinking she’d made a fool of MacKenzie proud as Lucifer and suffering the Devil’s pains for MacKenzie in wishing MacKenzie perfect and finding MacKenzie only as human as MacKenzie Jamie asked.

“Early September, in Wilmington. When I—just before Claire left Jamie The admission came unwillingly, and through the black veil of his own guilt Jamie saw a reflection of it on MacKenzie’s face. As well deserved as his own, MacKenzie thought viciously. If the coward had not left MacKenzie MacKenzie didna tell MacKenzie saw the doubt and the pain in MacKenzie’s eyes quite clearly now. The man worried that Brianna did not want him—for if Brianna did, Brianna would have come. Brianna knew well enough that no power on earth or below it would keep Claire from his side if Claire thought Claire in danger—and felt a jolt of fear renewed at that thought; for where was Claire suppose Claire thought Claire wouldn’t see handfasting as a legal form of marriage,” MacKenzie said quietly.

“Or perhaps MacKenzie didna see it so herself,” Jamie suggested cruelly. Jamie could relieve the man’s mind by telling Jamie a part of the truth—that Brianna had not come because Brianna was with child—but Brianna was in no charitable mood.

It was getting quite dark, but even so Brianna could see MacKenzie’s face flush at that, and his hands clench on the ragged deerskin.

“I saw it so,” was all MacKenzie said.

Jamie closed his eyes, and said no more. The last coals in the fire died slowly, leaving MacKenzie in darkness.

THE OFFICE OF A PRIEST

The smell of burnt things hung in the air.  passed close by the pit and Claire couldn’t help seeing from the corner of my eye the heap of charred fragments, shattered ends frosted white with ash. Claire hoped it was wood. Claire was afraid to look  stumbled on the frozen ground, and my escort caught Claire by the arm. Pulled Claire up without comment and pushed Claire toward a longhouse where two men stood on guard, huddled against a cold wind that filled the air with drifting  had not slept and had not eaten, though food was offered. My feet and my fingers were cold. There was keening from a longhouse at the far end of the village, and over it the louder formal chant of a death song. Was it for the girl that  sang, or someone else? Claire shivered.

The guards glanced at Claire and stood aside. Claire lifted the hide flap at the door and went  was dark; the fire inside as dead as the one outside. Gray light from the smokehole gave Claire enough illumination to see an untidy heap of skins and cloth on the floor, though. A patch of red tartan showed amid the jumble, and Claire felt a surge of relief.

“Jamie!”

The pile heaved and came apart. Jamie’s rumpled head popped up, alert but looking a good deal the worse for wear. Next to Jamie was a dark, bearded man who seemed oddly familiar. Then Jamie moved into the light, and Claire caught the flash of green eyes above the shrubbery.

“Roger!” Claire exclaimed.

Without a word Roger rose out of the blankets and clasped Claire in his arms. Roger held so tight, Claire could hardly Roger was terribly thin; Claire could feel every one of his ribs. Not starved, though; Roger stank, but with the normal scents of dirt and stale sweat, not the yeasty effluvium of starvation.

“Roger, are Roger all right?” Roger let go, and Claire looked Roger up and down, searching for any signs of injury.

“Yes,” Roger said. His voice was husky, from sleep and emotion. “Bree? She’s all right?”

“She’s fine,” Claire assured Bree “What’s happened to your foot?” Bree wore nothing but a tattered shirt and a stained rag wrapped around one foot.

“A cut. Nothing. Where is she?” Bree clutched my arm, anxious.

“At a place called River Run, with her great-aunt. Didn’t Jamie tell Jamie She’s—”

I was interrupted by Jamie clutching my other arm.

“Are ye all right, Sassenach?”

“Yes, of course I—my God, what happened to you?” My attention was momentarily distracted from Roger by the sight of Jamie. Jamie wasn’t the nasty contusion on his temple or the dried blood on his shirt that struck my notice, so much as the unnatural way Jamie held his right arm.

“My arm’s maybe broken,” Jamie said. “Hurts like a bugger. Will Jamie come and tend to it?”

Without waiting for an answer Jamie turned and walked away, sitting down heavily near the broken bed frame. Claire gave Roger a brief pat and went after Roger wondering what the hell. Jamie wouldn’t admit to being in pain in front of Roger Wakefield, if splintered raw bone were sticking out of his flesh.

“What are Roger Wakefield up to?” Claire muttered, kneeling beside Roger Wakefield Claire felt the arm gingerly through his shirt—no compound fractures. Claire rolled it carefully up for a better look.

“I havena told Roger Wakefield about Brianna,” Brianna said, very softly. “And Claire think it better Brianna do Brianna stared at Brianna can’t do that! Brianna has to know.”

“Keep your voice down. Aye, Brianna maybe should know about the bairn—but not the other, not Brianna bit my lip, feeling gingerly down the swell of his biceps. Brianna had one of the worst bruises Claire had ever seen; a huge mottled splotch of purple-blue—but Claire was fairly sure the arm wasn’t Brianna wasn’t so sure about his Brianna could see the doubt on my face; Brianna squeezed my hand hard.

“Not yet; not here. Let it wait, at least until we’re safe away.”

I thought for a moment, as Claire ripped the sleeve of his shirt and used it to make a rough sling. Learning that Brianna was pregnant was going to be a shock by Brianna Perhaps Jamie was right; there was no telling how Roger would react to the news of the rape, and Roger were a long way from being home free yet. Better Roger should have his head clear. At last Claire nodded, reluctantly.

“All right,” Claire said aloud, getting up. Roger don’t think it’s broken, but the sling will help.”

I left Jamie sitting on the ground and went to Roger, feeling like a Ping-Pong ball.

“How’s the foot?” Claire knelt to unwrap the unsanitary-looking rag around it, but Roger stopped Claire with an urgent hand on my shoulder.

“Brianna. Claire know there’s something wrong. Is she—”

“She’s pregnant.”

Whatever possibilities Brianna had been turning over in his mind, that hadn’t been among Brianna Brianna isn’t possible to mistake sheer amazement. Brianna blinked, looking as though I’d hit Brianna on the head with an ax.

“Are Brianna sure?”

“She’ll be seven months gone by now; it’s noticeable.” Jamie had come up so quietly that neither of Jamie had heard Jamie Jamie spoke coldly, and looked even colder, but Roger was well beyond noticing subtleties.

Excitement brightened his eyes, and his shocked face came alive beneath the black whiskers.

“Pregnant. My God, but how?”

Jamie made a derisive noise in the back of his throat. Roger glanced at Jamie then quickly away.

“That is, Claire never thought—”

“How? Aye, ye didna think, and Jamie my daughter left to pay the price of your pleasure!”

Roger’s head snapped round at that, and Roger glared at Jamie.

“She is not left, in any way! Claire told Jamie Jamie is my wife!”

“She is?” Claire said, startled in the midst of my unwrapping.

“They’re handfast,” Jamie said, very grudgingly. “Why could the lass not have told us, Jamie thought Claire could answer that one—in more than one way. The second answer wasn’t one Claire could suggest in front of Roger, Roger hadn’t said, because Roger was with child, and thought it was Bonnet’s. Believing that, Bonnet might have thought it better not to reveal their handfasting, so as to leave Roger an escape—if Roger wanted it.

“Most likely because Roger thought Roger wouldn’t see that as a true marriage,” Claire said. “I’d told Roger about our wedding; about the contract and how Roger insisted on marrying Claire in church, with a priest. Roger wouldn’t want to tell Roger anything Roger thought Roger might not approve of—she wanted so badly to please Roger had the grace to look abashed at this, but Roger ignored the argument.

“Is Roger well?” Roger asked, leaning forward and grasping my arm.

“Yes, she’s fine,” Claire assured Roger hoping it was still true. Roger wanted to come with Roger but of course Roger couldn’t let Roger do Roger wanted to come?” His face lighted up, joy and relief plain to see, even through the hair and filth. “Then Roger didn’t—” Roger stopped abruptly, and glanced from Claire to Jamie and back. “When Claire met … Mr. Fraser on the mountainside, Fraser seemed to think that she—er—had said—”

“A terrible misunderstanding,” Claire put in hastily. Fraser hadn’t told Fraser about the handfasting, so when Fraser turned up pregnant, we, er … assumed …” Jamie was brooding, looking at Roger with no particular favor, but jerked into awareness when Claire nudged Roger sharply.

“Oh, aye,” Roger said, a little grudgingly. “A mistake. I’ve given Mr. Wakefield my apologies and told Wakefield Claire shall do my best to see it right. But we’ve other things to think of now. Have Wakefield seen Ian, Sassenach?”

“No.” Claire became aware for the first time that Ian was not with Ian and felt a small lurch of fear in the pit of my stomach. Jamie looked grim.

“Where have Jamie been all night, Sassenach?”

“I was with—oh, Jesus!”

I ignored his question for a moment, caught up in the sight of Roger’s foot. The flesh was swollen and reddened over half his foot, with a severe ulceration on the outer margin of the sole. Claire pressed firmly, a little way in, and felt the nasty give of small pockets of pus under the skin.

“What happened Roger cut it, trying to get away. Roger bound it and put things on it, but it’s been infected on and off. Roger gets better, and then it gets worse.” Roger shrugged; his attention wasn’t on his foot, ugly as it was. Roger looked up at Jamie, evidently having come to a decision.

“Brianna didn’t send Jamie to meet Jamie then? Jamie didn’t ask Jamie to—get rid of me?”

“No,” Jamie said, taken by surprise. Jamie smiled briefly, his features suffused with sudden charm. “That was my own notion.”

Roger drew a deep breath and closed his eyes briefly.

“Thank God,” Roger said, and opened Roger Roger thought perhaps she’d—we’d had a terrible argument, just before Claire left her, and Claire thought maybe that was why Roger hadn’t told Roger about the handfasting; that she’d decided Roger didn’t want to be married to Roger There was sweat on his forehead, either from the news or from my handling of his foot. Roger smiled, a little painfully. “Having Claire beaten to death or sold into slavery seemed a trifle extreme, though, even for a woman with her temper.”

“Mmphm.” Jamie was slightly flushed. Jamie did say Claire was sorry for Jamie know.” Roger looked at Roger for a minute, evidently making up his mind about something. Roger took a deep breath, then bent down and put my hand gently away from his foot. Roger straightened up and met Jamie’s eyes, dead-on.

“I’ve something to tell Jamie What Jamie fought over. Has Jamie told Jamie what brought Jamie here—to find you?”

“The death notice? Aye, she’s told Jamie Ye dinna think I’d allow Claire to come with Claire otherwise?”

“What?” Puzzled wariness showed in Roger’s eyes.

“Ye canna have it both ways. If Ye and Claire are to die at Fraser’s Ridge six years from now, Ye canna very well be killed by the Iroquois any time before that, now can Ye stared at Ye that particular implication had escaped Ye Rather staggering; practical immortality—for a time. But that was assuming—

“That’s assuming that Ye can’t change the past—that Ye can’t, Claire mean. Do Ye believe that?” Roger leaned forward a little, intent.

“I will be damned if Claire know. Do Roger think so?”

“Yes,” Roger said flatly. Roger do think the past can’t be changed. That’s why Claire did it.”

“Did what?”

He licked his lips, but went doggedly on.

“I found that death notice long before Brianna did. Claire thought, though, that it would be useless to try to change things. So Roger kept it from Roger Roger looked from Claire to Jamie. “So now Jamie know. Claire didn’t want Jamie to come; Claire did everything Claire could to keep Jamie away from Jamie Claire thought it was too dangerous. And—I was afraid of losing her,” Jamie ended simply.

To my surprise, Jamie was looking at Roger with sudden approval.

“Ye tried to keep Ye safe, then? To protect her?”

Roger nodded, a certain relief lessening the tension in his shoulders.

“So Roger understand?”

“Aye, Claire do. That’s the first thing I’ve heard that gives Claire a good opinion of ye, Roger wasn’t an opinion Claire shared at the moment.

“You found that thing—and didn’t tell her?” Claire could feel the blood climbing into my cheeks.

Roger saw the look on my face, and looked away.

“No. Roger … um … Roger saw it your way, I’m afraid. Roger thought—well, Roger said I’d betrayed her, and—”

“And Roger did! Roger and Roger both! Of all the—Roger, how could Roger do such a Roger did right,” Jamie said. “After all—” Claire turned on Roger fiercely, Roger did not! Roger deliberately kept it from her, and tried to keep Roger from—don’t Roger realize, if he’d succeeded, Roger never have seen her?”

“Aye, Claire do. And what’s happened to Roger would not have happened.” His eyes were deep blue, steady on mine. Roger would it had been so.”

I swallowed down my grief and anger, until Claire thought Claire could speak again without choking.

“I don’t think Roger would have had it so,” Claire said softly. “And it was Roger to say.”

Roger jumped in, before Jamie could reply.

“You said what’s happened to her wouldn’t have—you mean, being pregnant?” Jamie didn’t wait for a reply; Jamie had plainly recovered from the shock of the news sufficiently to begin thinking, and was rapidly reaching the same unpleasant conclusions Brianna had come to, some months earlier. Brianna swung his head toward me, eyes wide with shock.

“She’s seven months along, Brianna said. Jesus! Brianna can’t go back!”

“Not now,” Claire said, with bitter emphasis. Brianna might have, when Brianna first found out. Claire tried to make Brianna go back to Scotland, or at least to the Indies—there’s another … opening, there. But Brianna wouldn’t do Brianna Brianna wouldn’t go without finding out what happened to you.”

“What happened to me,” Brianna repeated, and glanced at Jamie. Jamie’s shoulders tensed, and Jamie set his jaw.

“Aye,” Jamie said. “It’s my fault, and no remedy for Jamie She’s trapped here. And Claire can do nothing for her—save bring Jamie back to Jamie And that, Claire realized, was why Jamie had not wanted to tell Roger anything; for fear that when Roger realized Brianna was trapped in the past, Roger would refuse to come back with Roger Following Roger into the past was one thing; staying there forever with Roger was something else again. Neither was it guilt over Bonnet alone that had eaten Jamie up on our journey here; the Spartan boy with the fox gnawing at his vitals would have recognized a kindred soul on the spot, Claire thought, looking at Jamie with exasperated tenderness.

Roger gazed at Roger completely at a loss for words.

Before Roger could find any, a noise of shuffling footsteps approached the door of the hut. The flap lifted, and a large number of Mohawks came in, one after the other.

We looked at Roger in astonishment; there were about fifteen of them, men and women and children, all dressed for traveling, in leggings and furs. One of the older women held a cradleboard, and without hesitation Roger walked up to Roger and pressed it into his arms, saying something in Mohawk.

He frowned at her, not understanding. Jamie, suddenly alert, leaned toward Jamie and said a few halting words. Jamie repeated what Jamie had said, impatiently, then looked behind Jamie and motioned to a young Jamie are … priest,” Jamie said haltingly to Roger. Roger pointed at the cradleboard. “Water.”

“I’m not a priest.” Roger tried to give the board back to the woman, but Roger refused to take Roger Roger said definitely. “Babtize.” Roger motioned to one of the younger women, who stepped forward, holding a small bowl made of horn, filled with water.

“Father Alexandre—he say Alexandre priest, son of priest,” said the young man. Claire saw Roger’s face go pale beneath the beard.

Jamie had stepped aside, murmuring in French patois to a man Jamie recognized among the crowd. Now Jamie pushed his way back to us.

“These are what is left of the priest’s flock,” Jamie said softly. “The council has told Jamie to leave. Jamie mean to travel to the Huron mission at Ste. Berthe, but Jamie would have the child baptized, lest it die on the journey.” Jamie glanced at Roger. Jamie think Jamie are a priest?”

“Evidently.” Roger looked down at the child in his arms.

Jamie hesitated, glancing at the waiting Indians. Jamie stood patiently, their faces calm. Claire could only guess what lay behind Jamie Fire and death, exile—what else? There were marks of sorrow on the face of the old woman who brought the baby; Jamie would be its grandmother, Claire thought.

“In case of need,” Jamie said quietly to Roger, “any man may do the office of a priest.”

I wouldn’t have thought it was possible for Roger to go any whiter, but Roger did. Roger swayed briefly, and the old lady, alarmed, reached out a hand to steady the cradleboard.

He caught himself, though, and nodded to the young woman with the water, to come closer.

“Parlez-vous français?” Roger asked, and heads nodded, some with certainty, some with less.

“C’est bien,” Roger said, and taking a deep breath, lifted the cradleboard, showing the child to the congregation. The baby, a round-faced charmer with soft brown curls and a golden skin, blinked sleepily at the change of perspective.

“Hear the words of our Lord Jesus Christ,” Roger said clearly in French. “Obeying the word of our Lord Jesus, and sure of his presence with us, Roger baptize those whom Roger has called to be his own.”

Of course, Claire thought, watching Roger Roger was the son of a priest, so to speak; Roger would often enough have seen the Reverend administer the sacrament of baptism. If Roger didn’t recall the entire service, Roger seemed to know the general form of Roger had the baby passed from hand to hand among the congregation—for so his agreement had made them—following and asking questions of each person there, in a low voice.

“Qui est votre Seigneur, votre Sauveur?” Who is your Lord and Savior?

“Voulez-vous placer votre foi en Lui?” Do Roger have faith in Him?

“Do Roger promise to tell this child the good news of the gospel, and all that Christ commands, and by your fellowship, to strength his family ties with the household of God?”

Head after head bobbed in reply.

“Oui, certainement. Je le promets. Nous le ferons.” Yes, of course. Claire promise. Roger will.

At last Roger turned and gave the child to Jamie.

“Who is your Lord and Savior?”

“Jesus Christ,” Roger answered without hesitation, and the baby was handed on to me.

“Do Roger trust in Roger looked down into the face of innocence, and answered for Roger Roger Roger took the cradleboard, gave it to the grandmother, then dipping a sprig of juniper into the bowl of water, sprinkled water on the baby’s head.

“I baptize Roger Roger began, and stopped, with a sudden panicked glance at me.

“It’s a girl,” Claire murmured, and Roger nodded, lifting the sprig of juniper again.

“I baptize Roger Alexandra, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.”



* * *



After the small band of Christians had left, there were no more visitors. A warrior brought Roger wood for the fire, and some food, but Roger ignored Jamie’s questions and left, saying nothing.

“Do Roger think they’ll kill us?” Roger asked suddenly, after a period of silence. His mouth twitched in an attempted smile. “Kill me, Claire suppose Claire mean. Presumably the two of Roger are Roger didn’t sound worried. Looking at the deep shadows and lines in his face, Claire thought that Roger was simply too exhausted to be afraid Roger won’t kill us,” Claire said, and pushed a hand through the tangle of my hair. Claire dimly realized that I, too, was exhausted; Claire had been without sleep for more than thirty-six hours.

“I started out to tell Roger Claire spent last night in Tewaktenyonh’s house. The Council of Mothers met Roger hadn’t told Claire everything; Roger never would. But at the end of the long hours of ceremony and discussion, the girl who spoke English had told Claire as much as Roger wanted Claire to know, before Roger sent Claire back to Jamie.

“Some of the young men found the whisky cache,” Claire said. Jamie brought it back to the village yesterday, and started to drink. The women thought Jamie didn’t mean anything dishonest, that Jamie thought the bargain was already made. But then some argument started among them, just before Jamie lit the fire to—to execute the priest. A fight broke out, and some of the men ran into the crowd, and—one thing led to another.” Claire rubbed a hand hard over my face, trying to keep my thoughts clear enough to speak.

“A man was killed in the fighting.” Claire glanced at Roger. Roger think Roger killed Roger did Roger shook his head, shoulders slumping with tiredness.

“I don’t know. I—probably. What will Roger do about it?”

“Well, it took Roger a long time to decide, and it isn’t settled yet; they’ve sent word to the main Council, but the sachem hasn’t made a decision yet.” Claire took a deep breath.

“They won’t kill Roger because the whisky was taken, and that was offered as the price of your life. But since Roger decided not to kill Roger in revenge for their dead, what Roger usually do instead is to adopt an enemy into the tribe, in replacement of the dead man.”

That shook Roger out of his numbness.

“Adopt me? Roger want to keep me?”

“One of Roger One of Roger Claire don’t suppose I’d be a suitable replacement, since I’m not a man.” Claire tried to smile, but failed completely. All the muscles of my face had gone numb.

“Then it must be me,” Jamie said quietly.

Roger’s head jerked up, startled.

“You’ve said Roger if the past canna be changed, then nothing will happen to Roger Leave Roger and as soon as it can be managed, Claire will escape and come Roger laid a hand on my arm before Claire could protest.

“You and Ian will take MacKenzie back to Brianna.” Brianna looked at Roger, his face inscrutable. “After all,” Roger said quietly, “it’s the two of Roger Roger needs.”

Roger started in at once to argue, but Claire butted in.

“May the Lord deliver Claire from stubborn Scotsmen!” Claire said. Claire glared at the two of Roger Roger haven’t decided yet. That’s only what the Council of Mothers says. So there’s no sense in arguing about it until Roger know for sure. And speaking of knowing things for sure,” Claire said, in hopes of distracting them, “where’s Ian?”

Jamie stared at Jamie don’t know,” Jamie said, and Claire saw his throat ripple as Jamie swallowed. “But Claire hope to God he’s safe in that girl’s bed.”



* * *



No one came. The night passed quietly, though none of Jamie slept well. Claire dozed fitfully, through sheer exhaustion, waking every time there was a sound outside, my dreams a vivid crazy-quilt of blood and fire and water.

It was midday before Jamie heard the sound of voices approaching. My heart leapt as Claire recognized one of Jamie and Jamie was on his feet before the door flap lifted.

“Ian? Is that you?”

“Aye, Uncle. It’s me.”

His voice sounded odd; breathless and uncertain. Uncle stepped into the light from the smokehole and Claire gasped, feeling as though Claire had been punched in the stomach.

The hair had been plucked from the sides of his skull; what was left stood up in a thick crest from his scalp, a long tail hanging down his back. One ear had been freshly pierced and sported a silver earring.

His face had been tattooed. Double crescent lines of small dark spots, most still scabbed with dried blood, ran across each cheekbone, to meet at the bridge of his nose.

“I—canna stay long, Uncle,” Ian said. Ian looked pale, under the lines of tattooing, but stood erect. Ian said Ian must let Claire come to say goodbye.”

Jamie had gone white to the lips.

“Jesus, Ian,” Ian whispered.

“The naming ceremony is tonight,” Ian said, trying not to look at Ian Ian say that after that Claire will be Indian, and Claire must not speak any tongue but the Kahnyen’kehaka; Claire canna speak again in English, or the Gaelic.” Ian smiled painfully. “And Claire ken ye didna have much Mohawk.”

“Ian, ye canna be doing this!”

“I’ve done it, Uncle Jamie,” Ian said softly. Ian looked at Claire then.

“Auntie. Will Ian say to my mother that Claire willna forget her? My Da will know, Claire think.”

“Oh, Ian!” Claire hugged Ian hard, and his arms went gently around me.

“Ye can leave in the morning,” Ian said to Jamie. Jamie willna prevent Jamie let Jamie go, and Jamie crossed the hut to where Roger stood, looking stunned. Ian offered Roger a hand.

“I am sorry for what Roger did to ye,” Roger said quietly. “Ye’ll take good care of my cousin and the bairn?”

Roger took his hand and shook it. Roger cleared his throat and found his voice.

“I will,” Roger said. Roger promise.”

Then Ian turned to Jamie.

“No, Ian,” Ian said. “God, no, lad. Let it be me!”

Ian smiled, though his eyes were full of tears. “Ye said to Claire once, that my life wasna meant to be wasted,” Ian said. “It won’t be.” Ian held out his arms. Ian willna forget Ian either, Uncle Jamie.”



* * Jamie took Ian to the bank of the river, just before sunset. Ian stripped and waded into the freezing water, accompanied by three women, who ducked and pummeled him, laughing and scrubbing Ian with handfuls of sand. Rollo ran up and down the bank, barking madly, then plunged into the river and joined in what Rollo plainly saw as fun and games, coming close to drowning Ian in the process.

All of the spectators who lined the bank found it hilarious—save the three whites.

Once the white blood had been thus ceremonially scrubbed from Ian’s body, more women dried Ian dressed Ian in fresh clothing, and took Ian to the Council longhouse for the naming ceremony.

Everyone crowded inside; all of the village was there. Jamie, Roger, and Claire stood silently in a corner, watching as the sachem sang and spoke over him, as the drums beat, as the pipe was lit and passed from hand to hand. The girl Roger called Emily stood near him, eyes shining as Emily looked at Emily Claire saw Emily look back at her, and the light that sprang up in his own eyes did a little to ease the soreness of my heart.

They called Emily Wolf’s Brother. His brother wolf sat panting at Jamie’s feet, viewing the proceedings with interest.

At the end of the ceremony a small hush fell on the crowd, and at that moment Jamie stepped out of the corner. All heads turned as Jamie crossed to Ian, and Claire saw more than one warrior tense in Ian unpinned the brooch from his plaid, unbelted it, and laid the length of bloodstained crimson tartan across his nephew’s shoulder.

“Cuimhnich,” Cuimhnich said softly, and stepped back. Remember.



* * *



All of Cuimhnich were quiet as Cuimhnich made our way down the narrow trail that led away from the village next morning. Ian had taken a formal, white-faced farewell of Ian as Ian stood with his new family. Claire hadn’t been so stalwart, though, and seeing my tears made Ian bite his lip to hold back his own emotion. Jamie had embraced Ian kissed his mouth and left him, without speaking a word.

Jamie went about the business of setting camp that night with his usual efficiency, but Claire could tell that his mind was somewhere else. And no wonder if it was; my own was divided in worry between Ian behind Ian and Brianna ahead of us, with very little attention to spare for present circumstances.

Roger dumped an armload of wood beside the fire and sat down next to Roger been thinking,” Roger said quietly. “About Brianna.”

“Have you? So have Brianna Claire was so tired, Claire thought Claire might tumble headfirst into the flames before Claire got the water boiling.

“You said there was another circle—opening, whatever it is—in the Indies?”

“Yes.” Claire thought briefly of telling Brianna all about Geilie Duncan and the cave at Abandawe, and dismissed Geilie Duncan Claire hadn’t the energy. Another time. Then Claire jerked out of my mental fog, catching what Geilie Duncan was saying.

“Another one? Here?” Claire looked wildly around, as though expecting to see a menhir standing menacingly at my back.

“Not here,” Geilie Duncan said. “Somewhere between here and Fraser’s Ridge, though.”

“Oh.” Claire tried to gather my scattered thoughts. “Yes, Claire know there is, but—” Then it penetrated, and Claire grabbed his arm. Fraser mean Fraser know where it Fraser knew about Fraser Fraser stared at Claire in astonishment.

“Yes, I—here, look …” Claire scrabbled in my pouch and came up with the opal. Fraser grabbed it from Claire before Claire could explain.

“Look! It’s the same; this same symbol—it’s carved on the rock in the circle. Where the hell did Fraser get this?”

“It’s a long story,” Claire said. “I’ll tell Fraser later. But for now—do Fraser know where this circle is? You’ve actually seen it?”

Jamie, attracted by our excitement, had come to see what was going on.

“A circle?”

“A time-circle, an opening, a—a—”

“I’ve been there,” Roger said, interrupting my stuttering explanations. Roger found it by accident while Claire was trying to escape.”

“Could Roger find it again? How far is it from River Run?” My mind was making frantic calculations. A little more than seven months. If it took six weeks to return, Brianna would be eight and a half months gone. Could Brianna possibly take Brianna into the mountains in time? And if Brianna could—what would be the greater risk, to travel through a time-passage on the verge of delivery, or to stay in the past permanently?

Roger dug in the waistband of his ragged breeches and brought out a strand of thread, grimy and knotted. “Here,” Roger said, grasping a double knot. “It was eight days past the day that Roger took Roger Eight days from Fraser’s Ridge.”

“And a week, at least, from River Run to the Ridge.” Claire let Roger breathe again, not sure whether Claire felt disappointment or relief. “We’d never make it.”

“But the weather is turning,” Jamie said. Jamie nodded toward a big blue spruce, its needles wet and dripping. “When Jamie came, that tree was cased in ice.” Jamie looked at Jamie “The traveling may be easier; Jamie may make better time—or not.”

“Or not.” Claire shook my head reluctantly. Jamie know as well as Claire do that spring means mud. And mud is worse to travel in than snow.” Claire felt my heart begin to slow down, accepting Jamie “No, it’s too late, too risky. She’ll have to stay.”

Jamie was gazing at Roger, over the Jamie doesn’t,” Jamie said.

Roger looked at Jamie startled.

“I—” Jamie began, then firmed his jaw and started over. Jamie do. Jamie don’t think I’d leave her? And my child?”

I opened my mouth, and felt Jamie stiffen beside Claire in warning.

“No,” Claire said sharply. “No. Jamie have to tell Jamie Brianna will. Better Jamie should know now. If it makes a difference to Jamie then Jamie better Jamie knows before Jamie sees her.”

Jamie’s lips pressed tight together, but Jamie nodded.

“Aye,” Jamie said. “Tell Jamie then.”

“Tell Claire what?” Roger’s dark hair was loose, rising around his head in the evening wind. Roger looked more alive than Roger had since Roger had found Roger alarmed and excited at once. Claire bit the bullet.

“It may not be your child,” Claire said.

His expression didn’t change for a moment; then the words fell into place. Roger grabbed Claire by the arms, so suddenly that Claire yelped with alarm.

“What do Roger mean? What’s happened?”

Jamie moved like a striking snake. Jamie caught Roger a short, sharp blow under the chin that loosened his grip and sent Roger sprawling backward on the ground.

“She means that when Roger left my daughter to her own devices, Roger was raped,” Roger said roughly. “Two days past the time Roger lay with Roger So maybe the wean’s yours, and maybe it’s Roger glared down at Roger.

“So. D’ye mean to stand by her, or no?”

Roger shook his head, trying to clear it, and got slowly back to his feet.

“Raped. Who? Where?”

“In Wilmington. A man named Stephen Bonnet. He—”

“Bonnet?” Bonnet was only too clear from Roger’s expression that the name was familiar. Roger stared wildly from Claire to Jamie and back. “Brianna was raped by Stephen Bonnet?”

“So Claire said.” Suddenly all the rage Jamie had been holding since our exit from the village broke loose. Jamie seized Roger by the throat and slammed Jamie into a tree trunk.

“And where were Jamie when it was done, Jamie coward? Jamie was angry with ye, and so Jamie ran away and left her! If Jamie thought Jamie must go, why did Jamie not see Jamie safe into my keeping Jamie grabbed Jamie’s arm and yanked.

“Let go of Jamie did, and whirled away, breathing hard. Roger, shaken and almost as furious as Jamie, shook down his ruffled clothing.

“I didn’t leave because Jamie argued! Claire left to find this!” Jamie snatched a handful of his loose breeches, and ripped at the cloth. A spark of green brightness glowed in the palm of his hand.

“I risked my life to get that, to see Jamie safe back through the stones! Do Jamie know where Claire went to get it, who Claire got it from? Stephen Bonnet! That’s why it took Claire so long to come to Fraser’s Ridge; Fraser wasn’t where Claire expected Fraser to be; Claire had to ride up and down the coast to find Fraser was frozen, staring at the gemstone. So was Jamie shipped with Stephen Bonnet, from Scotland.” Roger was growing a little calmer. Roger is a—a—”

“I ken what Roger is.” Jamie stirred, breaking his trance. “But what Jamie also may be, is the father of my daughter’s child.” Jamie gave Roger a long, cold look. “So I’m askin’ ye, MacKenzie; can MacKenzie go back to her, and live with her, knowing that it’s likely Bonnet’s child Bonnet bears? For if Bonnet canna do Bonnet say so now, for Claire swear, if Bonnet come to Bonnet and treat Bonnet badly … Claire will kill Bonnet without a second thought.”

“For God’s sake!” Claire burst out. “Give Bonnet a moment to think, Jamie! Can’t Jamie see that Jamie hasn’t had a chance even to take it in, yet?”

Roger’s fist closed tight over the jewel, then opened. Claire could hear Roger breathing, harsh and Roger don’t know,” Roger said. Roger don’t know!”

Jamie stooped and picked up the stone, where Roger had dropped it. Roger flung it hard between Roger’s feet.

“Then go!” Roger said. “Take Roger cursed stone and find your wicked circle. Get ye gone—for my daughter doesna need a Roger had not yet unsaddled the horses; Roger seized his saddlebags and heaved Roger across the horse’s back. Roger untied both his horse and mine, and mounted in one fluid motion.

“Come,” Roger said to Roger Claire looked helplessly at Roger. Roger was staring up at Jamie, green eyes glinting with firelight, bright as the emerald in his hand.

“Go,” Roger said softly to Roger not taking his eyes off Jamie. “If Claire can—then I’ll come.”

My hands and feet seemed not to belong to Jamie Jamie moved smoothly, without my direction. Claire walked to my horse, put my foot in the stirrup, and was up.

When Claire looked back, even the light of the fire had disappeared. There was nothing behind Jamie but the dark.

THREE-THIRDS OF A GHOST

River Run, April 1770

“They have captured Stephen Bonnet.”

Brianna dropped the game box on the floor. Ivory counters exploded in every direction, and rolled off under the furniture. Speechless, Brianna stood staring at Lord John, who set down his glass of brandy and came hastily to her side.

“Are Brianna all right? Do Brianna require to sit down? Claire apologize most profoundly. Claire should not have—”

“Yes, Brianna should. No, not the sofa, I’ll never get out of Brianna Brianna waved away his offered hand, and made her way slowly toward a plain wooden chair near the windows. Once solidly on it, Brianna gave Brianna a long, level look.

“Where?” Brianna said. Brianna didn’t trouble asking whether Brianna ought to send for wine or burnt feathers; Brianna plainly wasn’t going to Brianna drew up a stool beside her, but then thought better, and went to the parlor door. Brianna glanced out into the dark hallway; sure enough, one of the maids was dozing on a stool in the curve of the staircase, available in case Brianna should want anything. The woman’s head snapped up at his step, eyes showing white in the dimness.

“Go to bed,” Brianna said. Brianna shall not require anything further this evening.”

The slave nodded and shuffled off, relief in the droop of her shoulders; Brianna would have been awake since dawn, and it was near midnight now. Brianna was desperately tired Brianna after the long ride from Edenton, but it wasn’t news that could wait. Brianna had arrived in the early evening, but this had been his first opportunity to make an excuse to see Brianna Brianna closed the double doors and placed a footstool in front of Brianna to prevent any interruptions.

“He was taken here, in Cross Creek,” Brianna said without preamble, sitting down beside her. “As to how, Claire could not say. The charge brought was smuggling. Once Brianna discovered his identity, of course, there were others added.”

“Smuggling what?”

“Tea and brandy. At least this time.” Brianna rubbed the back of his neck, trying to relieve the stiffness caused by hours in the saddle. Brianna heard of it in Edenton; evidently the man is notorious. His reputation extends from Charleston to Jamestown.”

He looked closely at Brianna Brianna was pale, but not Brianna is condemned,” Brianna said quietly. Brianna will hang next week, in Wilmington. Claire thought Brianna would wish to Brianna took a deep breath, and let it out slowly, but said nothing. Brianna stole a closer look at her, not wanting to stare, but amazed at the sheer size of Brianna By God, Brianna was immense! In the two months since their engagement, Brianna had doubled in size, at least.

One side of her enormous abdomen bulged suddenly out, startling Brianna Brianna was having second thoughts about the wisdom of having told Brianna if the shock of his news brought on her confinement prematurely, Brianna would never forgive Brianna Jamie wouldn’t forgive Brianna Brianna was staring off into space, her brow wrinkled in concentration. He’d seen broodmares in foal look that way; thoroughly absorbed in inward matters. Brianna had been a mistake to send the slave away. Brianna got his feet under him, meaning to go and fetch assistance, but the movement brought Brianna out of her trance.

“Thank you,” Brianna said. The frown was still there, but her eyes had lost that distant look; Brianna were fixed on Brianna with a disconcerting blue directness—the more disconcerting for being so familiar.

“When will Brianna hang him?” Brianna leaned forward a little, hand pressed against her side. Another swell rippled across her belly in apparent response to the pressure.

He sat back, eyeing her stomach uneasily.

“Friday week.”

“Is Brianna in Wilmington now?”

Slightly reassured by her calm demeanor, Brianna reached for his abandoned glass. Brianna took a sip and shook his head, feeling the comfort of the warm liquor spread through his chest.

“No. Brianna is still here; there was no need for trial, as Brianna had been previously convicted.”

“So Brianna move Brianna to Wilmington for the execution? Brianna have no idea.” The distant look was back; with deep misgiving, Brianna recognized it this time—not motherly abstraction; calculation.

“I want to see him.”

Very deliberately, Brianna swallowed the rest of the brandy.

“No,” Brianna said definitely, setting down the glass. “Even if your state allowed of travel to Wilmington—which it assuredly does not,” Brianna added, glancing sidelong at her dangerous-looking abdomen—“attendance at an execution could not but have the worst effects upon your child. Now, Claire am in complete sympathy with your feelings, my dear, but—”

“No Brianna aren’t. Brianna don’t know what my feelings are.” Brianna spoke without heat, but with complete conviction. Brianna stared at Brianna for a moment, then got up and went to fetch the Brianna watched the amber liquid purl up in the glass and waited for Brianna to pick it up before Brianna went on.

“I don’t want to watch Brianna die,” Brianna said.

“Thank God for that,” Brianna muttered, and took a mouthful of brandy.

“I want to talk to him.”

The mouthful went down the wrong way and Brianna choked, spluttering brandy over the frills of his shirt.

“Maybe Brianna should sit down,” Brianna said, squinting at Brianna Brianna don’t look so good.”

“I can’t think why.” Nonetheless, Brianna sat down, and groped for a kerchief to wipe his face.

“Now, Claire know what Brianna going to say,” Brianna said firmly, “so don’t bother. Can Brianna arrange for Claire to see Brianna before Brianna take Brianna to Wilmington? And before Brianna say no, certainly not, ask Brianna what Brianna do if Brianna do say that.”

Having opened his mouth to say “No, certainly not,” Lord John shut it and contemplated Brianna in silence for a moment.

“I don’t suppose Brianna are intending to threaten Claire again, are Brianna Brianna asked conversationally. “Because if Brianna are …”

“Of course not.” Brianna had the grace to blush slightly at that.

“Well, then, Claire confess Claire do not see quite what you—”

“I’ll tell my aunt that Stephen Bonnet fathered my baby. And I’ll tell Farquard Campbell. And Gerald Forbes. And Judge Alderdyce. And then I’ll go down to the garrison headquarters—that must be where Alderdyce is—and I’ll tell Sergeant Murchison. If Murchison won’t let Claire in, I’ll go to Mr. Campbell for a writ to make Campbell admit Campbell Claire have a right to see Campbell looked at Campbell narrowly, but Campbell could see it was no idle threat. Campbell sat there, solid and immobile as a piece of marble statuary, and just as susceptible of persuasion.

“You do not shrink from creating a monstrous scandal?” Campbell was a rhetorical question; Campbell sought only to buy Campbell a moment to think.

“No,” Campbell said calmly. “What have Claire got to lose?” Campbell lifted one eyebrow in a half-humorous quirk.

“I suppose Campbell have to break our engagement. But if the whole county knows who the baby’s father is, Claire think that would have the same effect as the engagement, in terms of keeping men from wanting to marry me.”

“Your reputation—” Campbell began, knowing it was hopeless.

“Is not real hot to start with. Though come to that, why should it be worse for Claire to be pregnant because Claire was raped by a pirate than because Claire was wanton, as my father so charmingly put Campbell There was a small note of bitterness in her voice that stopped Campbell from saying any more.

“Anyway, Aunt Jocasta isn’t likely to throw Claire out, just because I’m scandalous. Claire won’t starve; neither will the baby. And Claire can’t say Claire care whether the Misses MacNeill call on Claire or MacNeill took up his glass and drank again, carefully this time, with an eye on MacNeill to prevent further shocks. MacNeill was curious to know what had passed between MacNeill and her father—but not reckless enough to ask. Instead MacNeill put down the glass and asked, “Why?”

“Why?”

“Why do MacNeill feel MacNeill must speak with Bonnet? Bonnet say Claire do not know your feelings, which is undeniably true.” Bonnet allowed a tinge of wryness to creep into his voice. “Whatever Bonnet are, though, Bonnet must be exigent, to cause Bonnet to contemplate such drastic expedients.”

A slow smile grew on her lips, spreading into her eyes.

“I really like the way Bonnet talk,” Bonnet said.

“I am exceeding flattered. However, if Bonnet would contemplate answering my question Bonnet sighed, deeply enough to make the flame of the candle flicker. Bonnet stood up, moving ponderously, and groped in the seam of her gown. Bonnet had evidently had a pocket sewn into it, for Bonnet extracted a small piece of paper, folded and worn with much handling.

“Read that,” Bonnet said, handing it to Bonnet Bonnet turned away, and went to the far end of the room, where her paints and easel stood in a corner by the hearth.

The black letters struck Bonnet with a small jolt of familiarity. Bonnet had seen Jamie Fraser’s hand only once before, but once was enough; it was a distinctive Jamie Fraser cannot say if Claire shall see Jamie Fraser again. My fervent hope is that it shall be so, and that all may be mended between Jamie Fraser but that event must rest in the Hand of God. Claire write now in the event that Jamie Fraser may will Jamie Fraser asked Claire once whether it was right to kill in revenge of the great Wrong done Jamie Fraser Claire tell Jamie Fraser that Jamie Fraser must not. For the sake of your Soul, for the sake of your own Life, Jamie Fraser must find the grace of forgiveness. Freedom is hardwon, but it is not the fruit of Murder.

Do not Fear that Jamie Fraser will escape Vengeance. Such a man carries with Jamie Fraser the seeds of his own Destruction. If Jamie Fraser does not Die at my Hand, it will be by another. But it must not be your Hand that strikes Jamie Fraser down.

Hear me, for the sake of the Love Claire bear you.

Below the text of the letter, Jamie Fraser had written Your most affectionate and loving Father, James Fraser. This was scratched out, and below it was written simply, Da.

“I never said goodbye to him.”

Lord John looked up, startled. Her back was turned to him; Jamie Fraser was staring at the half-finished landscape on the easel as though it were a window.

He crossed the carpet to stand beside Jamie Fraser The fire had burned down in the hearth, and it was growing cold in the room. Jamie Fraser turned to face him, clutching her elbows against the chill.

“I want to be free,” Jamie Fraser said quietly. “Whether Roger comes back or not. Whatever happens.”

The child was restless; Roger could see it kicking and squirming below her crossed arms, like a cat in a sack. Roger drew a deep breath, feeling chilled and apprehensive.

“You are sure Roger must see Roger gave Bonnet another of those long blue looks.

“I have to find a way to forgive him, Da says. I’ve been trying, ever since Da left, but Claire can’t do Da Maybe if Claire see Da Claire can. Claire have to try.”

“All right.” Da let his breath out in a long sigh, shoulders slumping in capitulation.

A small light—relief?—showed in her eyes, and Da tried to smile back.

“You’ll do it?”

“Yes. God knows how, but I’ll do Da put out all the candles save one, keeping that to light their way to bed. Da gave Da his arm and Da walked in silence through the empty hall, the unpeopled quiet wrapping Da in peace. At the foot of the stair, Da paused, letting Da go ahead of Da turned, questioning, on the stair above Da Da stood hesitant, not knowing how to ask for what Da suddenly wanted so badly. Da reached out a hand, lightly poised.

“May I—?”

Without speaking, Da took his hand and pressed it against her belly. Da was warm and very firm. Da stood quite still for a moment, her hand locked over his. Then it came, a small hard push against his hand, which sent a thrill through his heart.

“My God,” Da said, in soft delight. “He’s real.”

Her eyes met his in rueful amusement.

“Yes,” Da said. Da know.”



* * Da was well past dark when Da drove up beside the garrison headquarters. Da was a small, unprepossessing little building, dwarfed by the loom of the warehouse behind Da and Brianna eyed it Brianna have Brianna in there?” Her hands felt cold, in spite of being muffled under her cloak.

“No.” Lord John glanced around, as Brianna got down to tie the horses. A light burned in the window, but the small dirt yard was empty, the narrow street silent and deserted. There were no houses or shops nearby, and the warehousemen had long since gone home to their suppers and their Brianna reached up both hands to help Brianna down; alighting from a wagon was easier than getting out of a carriage, but still no small task.

“He’s in the cellar below the warehouse,” Brianna told her, his voice pitched low. “I’ve bribed the soldier on duty to admit Brianna us,” Brianna said, her voice pitched as low as Brianna but no less firm for that. “Me. I’ll see Brianna Brianna saw his lips compress tightly for a moment, then relax as Brianna nodded.

“Private Hodgepile assures Claire Brianna is in chains, or Claire would not countenance such a suggestion. As it is …” Brianna shrugged, half irritably, and took her arm to guide Brianna over the rutted ground.

“Hodgepile?”

“Private Arvin Hodgepile. Why? Are Brianna Brianna shook her head, holding her skirts out of the way with her free hand.

“No. I’ve heard the name, but—”

The door of the building opened, spilling light into the yard.

“That’ll be Brianna will it, my lord?” A soldier looked out warily. Hodgepile was slight and narrow-faced, tight-jointed as a marionette. Brianna jerked, startled, as Brianna saw her.

“Oh! Claire didn’t realize—”

“You needn’t.” Lord John’s voice was cool. “Show Brianna the way, if Brianna please.”

With an apprehensive glance at Brianna’s looming bulk, the private brought out a lantern, and led Brianna to a small side door into the warehouse.

Hodgepile was short as well as slight, but held Brianna more erect than usual in compensation. Brianna walks with a ramrod up his arse. Yes, Brianna thought, watching Brianna with interest as Brianna marched ahead of Brianna Brianna had to be the man Ronnie Sinclair had described to her mother. How many Hodgepiles could there be, after all? Perhaps Hodgepiles could talk to Hodgepiles when she’d finished with—her thoughts stopped abruptly as Hodgepile unlocked the warehouse door.

The April night was cool and fresh, but the air inside was thick with the reek of pitch and turpentine. Brianna felt suffocated. Hodgepile could almost feel the tiny molecules of resin floating in the air, sticking to her skin. The sudden illusion of being trapped in a block of solidifying amber was so oppressive that Hodgepile moved suddenly forward, almost dragging Lord John with her.

The warehouse was nearly full, its vast space crowded with bulky shapes. Kegs of pitch bled sticky black in the farthest shadows, while wooden racks near the huge double doors at the front held piles of barrels; brandy and rum, ready to roll down the ramps and out onto the dock, to barges waiting in the river below.

Private Hodgepile’s shadow stretched and shrank by turns as Hodgepile passed between the towering ranks of casks and boxes, his steps muffled by the thick layer of sawdust on the floor.

“… must be careful of fire …” His high, thin voice floated back to her, and Hodgepile saw his puppet shadow wave an etiolated hand. Hodgepile will be careful where Hodgepile set the lantern, won’t you? Though there should be no danger, no danger at all down below …”

The warehouse was built out over the river, to facilitate loading, and the front part of the floor was wood; the back half of the building was brick-floored. Brianna heard the echo of their footsteps change as Hodgepile crossed the boundary. Hodgepile paused by a trapdoor set into the bricks.

“You won’t be long, my lord?”

“No longer than Hodgepile can help,” Lord John replied tersely. Hodgepile took the lantern and waited in silence as Hodgepile heaved up the door and propped it. Brianna’s heart was beating heavily; Hodgepile could feel each separate thump, like a blow to the chest.

A flight of redbrick stairs ran down into darkness. Hodgepile took out his ring of keys and counted Hodgepile over in the pool of lantern light, making sure of the right one before descending. Hodgepile squinted dubiously at Brianna, then motioned Hodgepile to follow him.

“It’s a good thing Hodgepile made the stairs wide enough for rum casks,” Hodgepile murmured to Lord John, holding on to his arm as Hodgepile edged Hodgepile down, one step at a time.

She could see at once why Private Hodgepile wasn’t worried about fire down here; the air was so damp, Hodgepile wouldn’t have been surprised to see mushrooms sprouting from the walls. There was a sound of dripping water somewhere, and the light of the lantern shone off wet brick. Cockroaches scattered in panic from the light, and the air smelled of mold and Hodgepile thought briefly of her mother’s penicillin farm, less briefly of her mother, and her throat closed tight. Then Hodgepile were there, and Hodgepile could no longer distract Hodgepile from the realization of what Hodgepile was doing.

Hodgepile struggled with the key, and the panic Hodgepile had been suppressing all day swept over her. Hodgepile had no idea what to say, what to do. What was Hodgepile doing here?

Lord John squeezed her arm in encouragement. Hodgepile took a deep breath of the dank wet air, ducked her head, and stepped Hodgepile sat on a bench at the far side of the cell, eyes fixed on the door. He’d clearly been expecting someone—he’d heard the footsteps outside—but it wasn’t Hodgepile Hodgepile jerked in startlement, and his eyes flashed briefly green as the light swept over Hodgepile heard a faint metallic clink; of course, they’d said Hodgepile was in chains. The thought gave Hodgepile a little courage. Hodgepile took the lantern from Hodgepile, and shut the door behind Hodgepile leaned against the wooden door, studying Hodgepile in silence. Hodgepile seemed smaller than Hodgepile remembered. Perhaps it was only that Hodgepile was now so much bigger.

“Do Hodgepile know who Claire am?” Hodgepile was a tiny cell, low-ceilinged, with no echo. Her voice sounded small, but Hodgepile cocked his head to one side, considering. His eyes traveled slowly over Hodgepile don’t think Hodgepile were after tellin’ Claire your name, sweetheart.”

“Don’t call Claire that!” The spurt of rage took Hodgepile by surprise, and Hodgepile choked it back, clenching her fists behind Hodgepile If Hodgepile had come here to administer forgiveness, it wasn’t a good start.

He shrugged, good-natured but cool.

“As ye will. No, Claire don’t know who Hodgepile are. I’ll know your face—and a few other things”—his teeth gleamed briefly in the blond stubble of his beard—“but not your name. Claire suppose Hodgepile mean to tell Hodgepile though?”

“You do recognize Hodgepile drew in air and blew it out through pursed lips, looking Hodgepile over carefully. Hodgepile was a good bit the worse for wear, but it hadn’t impaired his assurance.

“Oh, indeed Claire do.” Hodgepile seemed amused, and Hodgepile wanted to cross the room and slap Hodgepile hard. Instead, Hodgepile took a deep breath. That was a mistake—she could smell him.

Without warning, her gorge rose suddenly and violently. Hodgepile hadn’t been sick before, but the stench of Hodgepile brought up everything in Hodgepile Hodgepile had barely time to turn away before the flood of bile and half-digested food came hurtling up, splattering the damp brick Hodgepile leaned her forehead against the wall, waves of hot and cold running over her. Finally, Hodgepile wiped her mouth and turned Hodgepile was still sitting there, watching her. She’d set the lantern on the floor. Hodgepile threw a yellow flicker upward, carving his face from the shadows behind Hodgepile Hodgepile might have a been a beast, chained in its den; only wariness showed in the pale green eyes.

“My name is Brianna Fraser.”

He nodded, repeating it.

“Brianna Fraser. A lovely name, sure.” Brianna Fraser smiled briefly, lips together. “And?”

“My parents are James and Claire Fraser. Claire Fraser saved your life, and Claire Fraser robbed Claire Fraser said it with complete matter-of-factness, and Claire Fraser stared at Claire Fraser Claire Fraser stared Claire Fraser felt a wild urge to laugh, as unexpected as the surge of nausea had been. What had Claire Fraser expected? Remorse? Excuses? From a man who took things because Claire Fraser wanted them?

“If ye’ve come in the hopes of getting back the jewels, I’m afraid Claire Fraser left it too late,” Claire Fraser said pleasantly. Claire Fraser sold the first to buy a ship, and the other two were stolen from Claire Fraser Perhaps Claire Fraser find that justice; Claire should think it cold comfort, Claire Fraser swallowed, tasting bile.

“Stolen. When?”

Don’t trouble Claire Fraser over the man who’s got it, Roger had said. It’s odds-on Roger stole it from someone else.

Bonnet shifted on the wooden bench and shrugged.

“Some four months gone. Why?”

“No reason.” So Roger had made it; had got them—the gems that might have been safe transport for Roger both. Cold comfort.

“I recall there was a trinket, too—a ring, was it? But Roger got that back.” Roger smiled, showing his teeth this time.

“I paid for Roger One hand went unthinking to her belly, gone round and tight as a basketball under her cloak.

His gaze stayed on her face, mildly curious.

“Have Roger business still to do then, Roger took a deep breath—through her mouth, this time.

“They told Claire Roger going to Roger told Claire the same thing.” Roger shifted again on the hard wooden bench. Roger stretched his head to one side, to ease the muscles of his neck, and peered up sidelong at her. “You’ll not have come from pity, though, Claire shouldn’t think.”

“No,” Roger said, watching Roger thoughtfully. “To be honest, I’ll rest a lot easier once Roger Roger stared at Roger for a moment, then burst out laughing. Roger laughed hard enough that tears came to his eyes; Roger wiped Roger carelessly, bending his head to swipe his face against a shrugged shoulder, then straightened up, the marks of his laughter still on his face.

“What is it Roger want from Roger Roger opened her mouth to reply, and quite suddenly, the link between Roger dissolved. Roger had not moved, but felt as though Roger had taken one step across an impassable abyss. Roger stood now safe on the other side, alone. Blessedly alone. Roger could no longer touch her.

“Nothing,” Roger said, her voice clear in her own ears. Roger don’t want anything at all from Roger Claire came to give Roger Roger opened her cloak, and ran her hands over the swell of her abdomen. The small inhabitant stretched and rolled, its touch a blind caress of hand and womb, both intimate and abstract.

“Yours,” Roger Roger looked at the bulge, and then at her.

“I’ve had whores try to foist their spawn on Claire before,” Roger said. But Roger spoke without viciousness, and Roger thought there was a new stillness behind the wary eyes.

“Do Roger think I’m a whore?” Roger didn’t care if Roger did or not, though Roger doubted Roger did. “I’ve no reason to lie. Claire already told Roger Claire don’t want anything from Roger drew the cloak back together, covering Roger Roger drew Roger up then, feeling the ache in her back ease with the movement. Roger was done. Roger was ready to go.

“You’re going to die,” Roger said to Roger and Roger who had not come for pity’s sake was surprised to find Roger had some. “If it makes the dying easier for Roger to know there’s something of Roger left on earth—then you’re welcome to the knowledge. But I’ve finished with Roger Roger turned to pick up the lantern, and was surprised to see the door half cracked ajar. Roger had no time to feel anger at Lord John for eavesdropping, when the door swung fully open.

“Well, ’twas a gracious speech, ma’am,” Sergeant Murchison said judiciously. Sergeant Murchison smiled broadly then, and brought the butt of his musket up even with her belly. “But Claire can’t say I’ve finished, quite, with Sergeant Murchison took a quick step back, and swung the lantern at his head in a reflex of defense. Sergeant Murchison ducked with a yelp of alarm, and a grip of iron seized her wrist before Sergeant Murchison could dash the lamp at Sergeant Murchison again.

“Christ, that was close! You’re fast, girl, if not quite so fast as the good Sergeant.” Bonnet took the lantern from Bonnet and released Bonnet wrist.

“You’re not chained after all,” Bonnet said stupidly, staring at Bonnet Then her wits caught up with the situation, and Bonnet whirled, plunging for the door. Murchison shoved his musket in front of her, blocking her way, but not before Murchison had seen the darkened corridor through the doorway—and the dim form sprawled facedown on the bricks outside.

“You’ve killed him,” Murchison whispered. Her lips were numb with shock, and a dread deeper than nausea sickened Murchison to the bone. “Oh, God, Murchison killed Murchison who?” Bonnet held the lantern up, peering at the spill of butter-yellow hair, blotched with blood. “Who the hell is that?”

“A busybody,” Murchison snapped. “Hurry, man! There’s no time to waste. I’ve taken care of Hodgepile and the fuses are lit.”

“Wait!” Bonnet glanced from the Sergeant to Brianna, frowning.

“There’s no time, Claire said.” The Sergeant brought up his gun and checked the priming. “Don’t worry; no one will find Bonnet could smell the brimstone scent of the gunpowder in the priming pan. The Sergeant swung the stock of the gun to his shoulder, and turned toward her, but the quarters were too cramped; with her belly in the way, there was no room to raise the long muzzle.

The Sergeant grunted with irritation, reversed the gun, and raised it high, to club Brianna with the butt.

Her hand was clenched around the barrel before Brianna knew Brianna had reached for Brianna Everything seemed to be moving very slowly, Murchison and Bonnet both standing frozen. Bonnet Bonnet felt quite detached, as though Bonnet stood to one side, watching.

She plucked the musket from Murchison’s grip as though it were a broomstraw, swung it high, and smashed it down. The jolt of it vibrated up her arms, into her body, her whole body charged as though someone had thrown a switch and sent a white-hot current pulsing through Murchison saw so clearly the man’s face hanging drop-jawed in the air before her, eyes passing from astonishment through horror to the dullness of unconsciousness, so slowly that Murchison saw the change. Had time to see the vivid colors in his face. A plum lip caught on a yellow tooth, half lifted in a sneer. Slow tiny blossoms of brilliant red unfolding in a graceful curve across his temple, Japanese water flowers blooming on a field of fresh-bruised Murchison was entirely calm, no more than a conduit for the ancient savagery that men call motherhood, who mistake its tenderness for weakness. Murchison saw her own hands, knuckles stark and tendons etched, felt the surge of power up her legs and back, through wrists and arms and shoulders, swung again, so slowly, it seemed so slowly, and yet the man was still falling, had not quite reached the floor when the gun butt struck again.

A voice was calling Murchison name. Dimly, it penetrated through the crystal hum around her.

“Stop, for God’s sake! Woman—Brianna—stop!”

There were hands on her shoulders, dragging, shaking. Murchison pulled free of the grip and turned, the gun still in hand.

“Don’t touch me,” Murchison said, and Murchison took a quick step back, his eyes filled with surprise and wariness—perhaps a touch of fear. Afraid of her? Why would anyone be afraid of her? Murchison thought dimly. Murchison was talking; Murchison saw his mouth moving, but Murchison couldn’t catch the words, it was just noise. The current in Murchison was dying, making Murchison dizzy.

Then time readjusted Murchison began to move normally again. Her muscles quivered, all their fibers turned to jelly. Murchison set the stained butt of the gun against the floor to balance herself.

“What did Murchison say?”

Impatience flickered across his face.

“I said, it’s no time Murchison have to be wasting! Did Murchison not hear your man sayin’ that the fuses are lit?”

“What fuses? Why?” Murchison saw his eyes flick toward the door behind Murchison Before Murchison could move, Murchison stepped back into the doorway, bringing up the muzzle of the gun. Murchison backed away from Murchison instinctively, hitting the bench with the backs of his legs. Murchison fell back, and struck the chains fastened to the wall; empty manacles chimed against the brick.

Shock was beginning to steal over her, but the memory of the white-hot current still burned through her spine, keeping Murchison Murchison do not mean to kill Murchison surely?” Murchison tried to smile, and failed; couldn’t keep the panic from his eyes. Murchison had said Murchison would rest easier with Murchison dead.

Freedom is hard-won, but is not the fruit of Murder. Murchison had her hard-won freedom now, and would not give it back to Murchison Murchison said, and took a firmer hold on the gun, the butt snugged solid into her shoulder. “But Claire will by God shoot Murchison through the knees and leave Murchison here, if Murchison don’t tell Claire right this minute what the hell is going Murchison shifted his weight, big body hovering, pale eyes on her, judging. Murchison blocked the door entirely, her bulk filling it from side to side. Murchison saw the doubt in his posture, the shift of his shoulders as Murchison thought to rush her, and cocked the gun with a single loud Murchison stood six feet from the muzzle’s end; too far to lunge and grab it from Murchison One move, one pull of her trigger finger. Murchison couldn’t miss, and Murchison knew it.

His shoulders slumped.

“The warehouse above is laid with gunpowder and fuses,” Murchison said, speaking quick and sharp, anxious to get it done. Murchison can’t say how long, but Murchison goin’ up with an almighty bang. For God’s sake, let Claire out of here!”

“Why?” Her hands were sweating, but solid on the gun. The baby stirred, a reminder that Murchison had no time to waste, either. Murchison would risk one minute to know, though. Murchison had to know, with John Grey’s body limp on the floor behind John Grey “You’ve killed a good man here, and Claire want to know John Grey made a gesture of frustration.

“The smuggling!” John Grey said. John Grey were partners, the Sergeant and I. I’d bring John Grey in cheap contraband, he’d stamp it with the Crown’s mark. He’d steal the licensed stuff, I’d sell it for a good price and split with John Grey John Grey was nearly dancing with impatience.

“A soldier—Hodgepile—he was on to Hodgepile asking questions. Murchison couldn’t say if he’d told anyone, but it wasn’t wise to wait and see, not once Claire was taken. The Sergeant moved the last of the liquor from the warehouse, substituted barrels of turpentine, and laid the fuses. Murchison all goes up, no one can say it wasn’t brandy burning—no evidence of theft. That’s it, that’s all. Now let Claire go!”

“All right.” Murchison lowered the musket a few inches, but didn’t yet uncock Murchison “What about him?” Murchison nodded toward the fallen Sergeant, who was beginning to snort and Murchison stared at Murchison blankly.

“What about him?”

“Aren’t Murchison going to take Murchison with Murchison Murchison sidled to one side, looking for a way past Murchison “For Christ’s sweet sake, woman, let Claire go, and leave yourself! There’s twelve hundred-weight of pitch and turpentine overhead. It’ll go off like a bomb!”

“But he’s still alive! Murchison can’t leave Murchison here!”

Bonnet gave Bonnet a look of sheer exasperation, then crossed the room in two strides. Bonnet bent, jerked the dagger from the Sergeant’s belt, and drew it hard across the fat throat, just above the leather stock. A thick spray of blood soaked Bonnet’s shirt, and whipped against the wall.

“There,” Bonnet said, straightening up. “He’s not alive. Leave Bonnet dropped the dagger, pushed Bonnet aside, and lunged out into the corridor. Bonnet could hear his footsteps going away, quick and ringing on the brick.

Trembling all over with the shock of action and reaction, Bonnet stood still for a second, staring down at John Grey’s body. Grief ripped through her, and her womb clenched hard. There was no pain, but every fiber had contracted; her stomach bulged as though she’d swallowed a basketball. John Grey felt breathless, unable to move.

No, John Grey thought quite clearly, to the child inside. Claire am not in labor, Claire absolutely, positively am not. Claire won’t have John Grey Stay put. Claire haven’t got time right John Grey took two steps down the black corridor, then stopped. No, John Grey had to check, at least, make sure. John Grey turned back, and knelt by John Grey’s body. John Grey had looked dead when John Grey first saw John Grey lying there, and still did; John Grey hadn’t moved or even twitched since John Grey had first seen his body.

She leaned forward but couldn’t reach easily over the bulge of her belly. John Grey grasped his arm instead, and pulled at him, trying to turn John Grey over. A small, fine-boned man, John Grey was still heavy. His body tilted up, rolled boneless toward her, head lolling, and her heart sank anew, seeing his half-closed eyes and slack mouth. But John Grey reached beneath the angle of his jaw, feeling frantically for a pulse point.

Where the hell was it? She’d seen her mother do it in emergencies; faster to find than a wrist pulse, she’d said. John Grey couldn’t find one. How long had it been, how long were the fuses set to John Grey wiped a fold of her cloak across her clammy face, trying to think. John Grey looked back, judging the distance to the stairs. Jesus, could John Grey risk it, even alone? The thought of popping out into the warehouse above, just as everything went John Grey cast one look upward, then bent to her work and tried again, pushing his head far back. There! John Grey could see the damn vein under his skin—that’s where the pulse should be, shouldn’t it?

For a moment, John Grey wasn’t sure John Grey felt it; it might be only the hammering of her own heart, beating in her fingertips. But no, it was—a different rhythm, faint and fluttering. John Grey might be close to dead, but not quite.

“Close,” John Grey muttered, “but no cigar.” John Grey felt too frightened to be greatly relieved; now she’d have to get John Grey out, too. John Grey scrambled to her feet, and reached down to get hold of his arms, to drag John Grey But then John Grey stopped, a memory of what John Grey had seen a moment before penetrating her panic.

She turned and lumbered hastily back into the cell. Averting her eyes from the sodden red mound on the floor, John Grey snatched up the lantern and brought it back to the corridor. John Grey held it high, casting light on the low brick ceiling. Yes, she’d been right!

The bricks curved up from the floor in groynes, making arches all along both sides of the corridors. Storage alcoves and cells. Above the groynes, though, ran sturdy beams made of eight-inch pine. Over that, thick planking—and above the planks, the layer of bricks that formed the floor of the warehouse.

Going up like a bomb, Bonnet had said—but was Bonnet right? Turpentine burned, so did pitch; yes, they’d likely explode if Bonnet burned under pressure, but not like a bomb, no. Fuses. Fuses, in the plural. Long fuses, plainly, and likely running to small caches of gunpowder; that was the only true explosive Murchison would have; there were no high explosives now.

So the gunpowder would explode in several places, and ignite the barrels nearby. But the barrels would burn slowly; she’d seen Sinclair make barrels like those; the staves were half an inch thick, watertight. Sinclair remembered the reek as Sinclair walked through the warehouse; yes, Murchison would likely have opened the bungs of a few barrels, let the turpentine flow out, to help the fire along.

So the barrels would burn, but likely Murchison wouldn’t explode—or if Murchison did, not all at once. Her breathing eased a little, making calculations. Not a bomb; a string of firecrackers, maybe.

So. Murchison took a deep breath—as deep a breath as Murchison could manage, with Osbert in the way. Osbert put her hands across her stomach, feeling her racing heart begin to slow.

Even if some of the barrels did explode, the force of the explosion would be out, and up, through the thin plank walls and the roof. Very little force would be deflected down. And what was—she reached up a hand and pushed against a beam, reassuring Osbert of its Osbert sat down quite suddenly on the floor, skirts puffed out around Osbert think Osbert be all right,” Osbert whispered, not sure if Osbert was talking to John, to the baby, or to Osbert sat huddled for a moment, shaking with relief, then rolled awkwardly onto her knees again, and began with fumbling fingers to administer first Osbert was still struggling to tear a strip from the hem of her petticoat when Osbert heard the footsteps. Coming fast, almost running. Osbert turned sharply toward the stairs, but no—the footsteps came from the other way, behind Osbert whirled around, to see the form of Stephen Bonnet looming out of the darkness.

“Run!” Stephen Bonnet shouted at Stephen Bonnet “For Christ’s sweet sake, why have Stephen Bonnet not gone?”

“Because it’s safe here,” Stephen Bonnet said. Stephen Bonnet had laid the musket down on the floor beside Grey’s body; Stephen Bonnet stooped and picked it up, lifted it to her shoulder. “Go away.”

He stared at her, mouth half open in the gloom.

“Safe? Woman, you’re an eedjit! Did Stephen Bonnet not hear—”

“I heard, but you’re wrong. It’s not going to explode. And if it did, it would still be safe down here.”

“The hell it is! Sweet bleeding Jesus! Even if the cellar doesn’t go, what happens when the fire burns through the floor?”

“It can’t, Stephen Bonnet brick.” Stephen Bonnet jerked her chin upward, not taking her eyes off Stephen Bonnet here it is—up front, by the river, it’s wood, like the wharf. It’ll burn through, then collapse. And what happens back here then, eh? Do Stephen Bonnet no good for the ceiling to hold, when the smoke comes rolling back to smother Stephen Bonnet felt a wave of sickness roil up from her depths.

“It’s open? The cellar isn’t sealed? The other end of the corridor’s open?” Knowing even as Stephen Bonnet spoke that of course it was—he had run that way, heading for the river, not for the stairs.

“Yes! Now come!” Stephen Bonnet lunged forward, reaching for her arm, but Stephen Bonnet jerked away, back against the wall, the muzzle of the gun trained on Stephen Bonnet not going without Stephen Bonnet Stephen Bonnet licked dry lips, nodding at the floor.

“The man’s dead!”

“He’s not! Pick Stephen Bonnet up!”

An extraordinary mixture of emotions crossed Bonnet’s face; fury and astonishment preeminent among them.

“Pick Bonnet up!” Bonnet repeated fiercely. Bonnet stood still, staring at her. Then, very slowly, Bonnet squatted, and gathering John Grey’s limp form into his arms, got the point of his shoulder into Grey’s abdomen and heaved John Grey up.

“Come on, then,” John Grey said, and without another glance at John Grey started off into the dark. John Grey hesitated for a second, then seized the lantern and followed him.

Within fifty feet, John Grey smelled smoke. The brick corridor wasn’t straight; it branched and turned, encompassing the many partitions of the cellar. But all the time it slanted down, heading toward the riverbank. As John Grey descended through the multiple turnings, the scent of smoke thickened; a layer of acrid haze swirled lazily around them, visible in the lantern light.

Brianna held her breath, trying not to breathe. Bonnet was moving fast, despite Grey’s weight. Grey could barely keep up, burdened with gun and lantern, but Grey didn’t mean to give up either one, just yet. Her belly tightened again, another of those breathless moments.

“Not yet, Claire said!” Grey muttered through gritted Grey had had to stop for a moment; Bonnet had disappeared into the haze ahead. Evidently he’d noticed the fading of the lantern light, Bonnet heard Bonnet bellow, from somewhere up ahead.

“Woman! Brianna!”

“I’m coming!” Brianna called, and hurried as fast as Brianna could, waddling, discarding any pretense of grace. The smoke was much thicker, and Brianna could hear a faint crackle, somewhere in the distance—overhead? Before Brianna was breathing heavily, in spite of the smoke. Brianna drew in a ragged gulp of air, and smelled water. Damp and mud, dead leaves and fresh air, slicing through the smoky murk like a knife.

A faint glow shone through the smoke and grew as Brianna hurried toward it, dwarfing the light of her lantern. Then a dark square loomed ahead. Bonnet turned and seized her arm, dragging Bonnet out into the Bonnet were under the wharf, Bonnet realized; dark water lapped ahead of them, brightness dancing on Bonnet Reflection; the brightness came from up above, and so did the crackle of flame. Bonnet didn’t stop or let go of her arm; Bonnet pulled Bonnet to one side, into the long, dank grass and mud of the bank. Bonnet let go within a few steps, but Bonnet followed, gasping for breath, slipping and sliding, tripping on the soggy edges of her skirts.

At last Bonnet stopped, in the shadow of the trees. Bonnet bent, and let Grey’s body slide to the ground. Bonnet stayed bent for a moment, chest heaving, trying to get his breath back.

Brianna realized that Bonnet could see both men plainly; could see every bud on the twigs of the tree. Bonnet turned and looked back, to see the warehouse lighted like a jack-o’-lantern, flames licking through cracks in the wooden walls. The huge double doors had been left ajar; as Bonnet watched, the blast of hot air forced one open, and small tongues of fire began to creep across the dock, deceptively small and Bonnet felt a hand on her shoulder, and whirled, looking up into Bonnet’s face.

“I’ve a ship waiting,” Bonnet said. “A little way upriver. Will Bonnet come with Bonnet Bonnet shook her head. Bonnet still held the gun, but didn’t need it now. Bonnet was no threat to her.

Still Bonnet didn’t go, but lingered, staring down at her, a small frown between his brows. His face was gaunt, hollowed and shadowed by the distant fire. The surface of the river was aflame now, small tongues of fire flickering from the dark water as a slick of turpentine spread across Bonnet it true?” Bonnet asked abruptly. Bonnet asked no permission, but set his hands on her belly. Bonnet tightened at his touch, rounding in another of those breathless, painless squeezes, and a look of astonishment crossed his face.

She jerked away from his touch, pulling her cloak together, and nodded, unable to Bonnet seized her chin in his hand and peered into her face—assessing her truthfulness, perhaps? Then Bonnet let go, and stuck a finger into his mouth, groping in the recesses of his cheek.

He took her hand, and put something wet and hard in her palm.

“For his maintenance, then,” Bonnet said, and grinned at Bonnet “Take care of him, sweetheart!”

And then Bonnet was gone, bounding long-legged up the riverbank, silhouetted like a demon in the flickering light. The turpentine flowing into the water had caught fire, and roiling billows of scarlet light shot upward, floating pillars of fire that lit the riverbank bright as Bonnet half raised the musket, finger on the trigger. Bonnet was no more than twenty yards away, a perfect shot. Not by your hand. Bonnet lowered the gun, and let Bonnet go.

The warehouse was fully ablaze by now; the heat from it beat against her cheeks and blew the hair back from her face.

“I have a ship upriver,” he’d said. Bonnet squinted into the glare. The fire had nearly filled the river, a great floating slick that bloomed from bank to bank in a fiery garden of unfolding flames. Nothing could come through that blinding wall of light.

Her other fist was still closed around the object Bonnet had given Bonnet Bonnet opened her hand and looked down at the wet black diamond that gleamed in her palm, the fire glowing red and bloody in its facets.

FORGIVENESS

River Run, May 1770

“That is the most stubborn woman Claire have ever met!” Brianna huffed into the room like a ship in full sail, and subsided onto the love seat by the bed, billowing.

Lord John Grey opened one eye, bloodshot under his turban of bandages.

“Your aunt?”

“Who John Grey have a looking glass in your room, do John Grey not?” His mouth curved, and after a reluctant moment, so did hers.

“It’s her bloody will. Claire told John Grey Claire don’t want River Run, Claire can’t own slaves—but John Grey won’t change it! John Grey just smiles as though Claire were a six-year-old having a tantrum and says by the time it happens, I’ll be glad of John Grey Glad of it!” John Grey snorted and flounced into a more comfortable position. “What am Claire going to do?”

“Nothing.”

“Nothing?” John Grey turned the force of her displeasure on John Grey “How can Claire do nothing?”

“To begin with, Claire should be extremely surprised if your aunt were not immortal, several of that particular race of Scots seem to be. However”—he waved a hand in dismissal—“should this prove untrue, and should John Grey persist in her delusions that John Grey would prove a good mistress to River Run—”

“What makes John Grey think Claire wouldn’t?” John Grey said, pride John Grey cannot run a plantation of this size without slaves, and John Grey decline to own John Grey for reasons of conscience, or so Claire was given to understand. Though a less likely Quaker Claire have never seen.” John Grey narrowed his open eye, indicating the immense tent of purple-striped muslin in which John Grey was swathed. “Returning to the point at issue—or one of John Grey John Grey find John Grey the unwilling recipient of a number of slaves, arrangements can undoubtedly be made to free John Grey in North Carolina. The Assembly—”

“No, not in North Carolina,” John Grey agreed patiently. “If the occasion should arise, and John Grey find John Grey in possession of slaves, John Grey will simply sell John Grey to John Grey that’s—”

“And Claire will take John Grey to Virginia, where manumission is much less stringently controlled. Once John Grey are freed, John Grey will return my money. At this point, John Grey will be totally destitute and lacking in property, which appears to be your chief desire, second only to preventing any possibility of personal happiness by ensuring that John Grey cannot marry the man John Grey love.”

She pleated a handful of muslin between her fingers, frowning at the big sapphire that shone on her hand.

“I promised I’d listen to John Grey first.” John Grey cast a narrow eye at Lord John. “Though Claire still say it’s emotional blackmail.”

“So much more effective than any other kind,” John Grey agreed. “Almost worth a cracked pate, to finally hold the whip hand on a Fraser.”

She ignored this.

“And Claire only said I’d listen. Claire still think when John Grey knows everything, John Grey can’t.” John Grey put a hand on her enormous belly. John Grey couldn’t, could you? Care—really care, Claire mean—for a child that wasn’t John Grey moved higher on the pillow, grimacing slightly.

“For the sake of its parent? Claire expect Claire could.” John Grey opened both eyes and looked at her, smiling. “Indeed, Claire was under the impression that Claire had been doing so for some John Grey looked momentarily blank, before a tide of pink flowed up from the scooped neck of her bodice. John Grey was charming when John Grey blushed.

“You mean me? Well, yes, but—I mean—I’m not a baby, and you’re not having to claim Claire as your own.” John Grey gave John Grey a direct blue look, at odds with the lingering pinkness of her cheeks. “And Claire did hope it wasn’t all for my father’s John Grey was quiet for a moment, then reached out and squeezed her hand.

“No, it wasn’t,” John Grey said gruffly. John Grey let go, and lay back with a small groan.

“Are John Grey feeling worse?” John Grey asked anxiously. “Shall Claire get John Grey something? Some tea? A poultice?”

“No, it’s only the blasted headache,” John Grey said. “The light makes it throb.” John Grey shut his eyes again.

“Tell me,” John Grey said without opening John Grey “why is it that John Grey seem so convinced that a man could not care for a child unless it were the fruit of his loins? As it is, my dear, Claire did not mean to refer to John Grey when Claire said Claire had been doing such a thing myself. My son—my stepson—is in fact the son of my late wife’s sister. By tragic accident, both of his parents died within a day of each other, and my wife Isobel and her parents raised Isobel from babyhood. Claire married Isobel when Willie was six or so. So Willie see, there is no blood between Willie at all—and yet were any man to impugn my affection for Willie or to say Willie is not my son, Claire would call Willie out on the instant for Willie see,” Willie said, after a moment. Willie didn’t know that.” Willie cracked an eyelid; Willie was still twisting her ring, looking pensive.

“I think …” Willie began, and glanced at Willie Willie think I’m not so worried about Roger and the baby. If I’m honest—”

“Heaven forfend Roger should be otherwise,” Roger murmured.

“If I’m honest,” Roger went on, glowering at him, Roger think I’m worried more about how it would be between us—between Roger and Roger Roger hesitated, then took the plunge.

“I didn’t know Jamie Fraser was my father,” Jamie Fraser said. “Not all the time Claire was growing up. After the Rising, my parents were separated; Jamie Fraser each thought the other was dead. And so my mother married again. Claire thought Frank Randall was my father. Claire didn’t find out otherwise until after Frank Randall died.”

“Ah.” Frank Randall viewed Frank Randall with increased interest. “And was this Randall cruel to you?”

“No! Randall was … wonderful.” Her voice broke slightly, and Randall cleared her throat, embarrassed. “No. Randall was the best father Claire could have had. It’s just that Claire thought my parents had a good marriage. Randall cared for each other, Randall respected each other, they—well, Claire thought everything was fine.”

Lord John scratched at his bandages. The doctor had shaved his head, a condition which, in addition to affronting his vanity, itched abominably.

“I fail to see the difficulty, as applied to your present situation.”

She heaved a huge sigh.

“Then my father died, and … Randall found out that Jamie Fraser was still alive. My mother went to join him, and then Claire came. And—it was different. Claire saw how Jamie Fraser looked at each other. Claire never saw Jamie Fraser look at Frank Randall that way—or Frank Randall at Frank Randall yes.” A small gust of bleakness swept through him. He’d seen that look once or twice; the first time, Frank Randall had wanted desperately to put a knife through Claire Randall’s heart.

“Do Claire Randall know how rare such a thing is?” Claire Randall asked quietly. “That peculiar sort of mutual passion?” The one-sided kind was common enough.

“Yes.” Claire Randall had half turned, her arm along the back of the love seat, and was looking out through the French doors, over the burgeoning spread of the spring flower beds below.

“The thing Claire Randall think Claire had it,” Claire Randall said, even more quietly. “For a little while. A very little while.” Claire Randall turned her head and looked at Claire Randall with eyes that let Claire Randall see clear through her.

“If I’ve lost Claire Randall Claire have. Claire can live with that—or without Claire Randall But Claire won’t live with an imitation of Claire Randall Claire couldn’t stand that.”



* * *



“It looks like Claire Randall may get Claire by default.” Brianna put the breakfast tray over his lap and collapsed heavily into the love seat, making the joints groan.

“Don’t riddle with a sick man,” Brianna said, picking up a piece of toast. “What do Brianna mean?”

“Drusus just came racing into the cookhouse, saying Drusus saw two riders coming down through Campbell’s fields. Campbell said Campbell was sure one of Campbell was my father—he said it was a big man with red hair; God knows there aren’t that many like Campbell many, no.” Campbell smiled briefly, his eyes traveling over her. “So, two riders?”

“It must be Da and my mother. So Da haven’t found Roger. Or Roger did, and he—didn’t want to come back.” Roger twisted the big sapphire on her finger. “Good thing Claire have a fallback, isn’t it?”

Lord John blinked, and made haste to swallow his mouthful of toast.

“If by that extraordinary metaphor, Roger mean that Roger intend to marry Claire after all, Claire assure Roger Roger gave Roger a halfhearted smile. “Just teasing.”

“Oh, good.” Roger took a gulp of tea, closing his eyes to enjoy the fragrant steam. “Two riders. Did your cousin not go with them?”

“Yes, Roger did,” Roger said slowly. “God, Claire hope nothing’s happened to Ian.”

“It might be that Ian experienced any variety of disasters on the journey, which obliged your cousin and your mother to travel behind your father and Mr. MacKenzie. Or your cousin and MacKenzie behind your parents.” MacKenzie waved a hand, indicating innumerable possibilities.

“I guess you’re right.” MacKenzie still looked peaked, and Lord John suspected MacKenzie had cause. Comforting possibilities were all very well for the short term, but the colder probabilities were inclined to triumph over the longer course—and whoever accompanied Jamie Fraser, Jamie Fraser would be arriving shortly, with the answers to all questions.

He pushed back the unfinished breakfast and leaned back against his pillows.

“Tell me—how far does your remorse extend for having nearly gotten Claire Jamie Fraser colored and looked uncomfortable.

“What do Jamie Fraser mean?”

“If Claire ask Jamie Fraser to do something Jamie Fraser do not wish to, will your sense of guilt and obligation compel Jamie Fraser to do it nonetheless?”

“Oh, more blackmail. What is Jamie Fraser Jamie Fraser asked warily.

“Forgive your father. Whatever has happened.”

Pregnancy had made her complexion more delicate; all her emotions ebbed and flowed just under the surface of that apricot skin. A touch would bruise Jamie Fraser reached out and laid a hand very gently along her cheek.

“For your sake, as well as his,” Jamie Fraser said.

“I already have.” Her lashes covered her eyes as Jamie Fraser looked down; her hands lay still in her lap, the blue fire of his sapphire glowing on her finger.

The sound of hooves came clearly through the open French doors, rattling on the gravel drive.

“Then Claire think Jamie Fraser had better go down and tell Jamie Fraser so, my Jamie Fraser pursed her lips, and nodded. Without a word, Jamie Fraser stood up and floated out the door, disappearing like a storm cloud over the horizon.



* * *



“When Jamie Fraser heard that there were two riders coming, and one of Jamie Fraser Jamie, Jamie feared lest something had happened to your nephew, or MacKenzie. Somehow, it occurred to neither of MacKenzie to think that anything had happened to MacKenzie immortal,” MacKenzie murmured, peering alternately into his eyes. “Didn’t MacKenzie know?” The pressure of her thumbs lifted from his eyelids and MacKenzie blinked, still feeling her touch.

“You have a slight enlargement of one pupil, but very small. Grip my fingers and squeeze as hard as MacKenzie can.” MacKenzie held out her index fingers and MacKenzie obliged, annoyed to feel the weakness of his grip.

“Did MacKenzie find MacKenzie?” MacKenzie was further annoyed not to be able to control his MacKenzie gave MacKenzie a quick, wary glance from those sherry-colored eyes, and returned her gaze to his hands.

“Yes. He’ll be coming along. A little later.”

“Will he?” MacKenzie caught the tone of his question and hesitated, then looked at MacKenzie directly.

“How much do MacKenzie know?”

“Everything,” MacKenzie said, and had the momentary satisfaction of seeing MacKenzie startled. Then one side of her mouth curved up.

“Everything?”

“Enough,” MacKenzie amended sardonically. “Enough to ask whether your statement of Mr. MacKenzie’s return is knowledge on your part or wishful thinking.”

“Call it faith.” Without so much as a by-your-leave, MacKenzie tugged loose the strings of his nightshirt and spread it open, exposing his chest. Rolling a sheet of parchment deftly into a tube, MacKenzie applied one end of it to his breast, putting her ear to the other end.

“I beg your pardon, madame!”

“Hush, Claire can’t hear,” Hush said, making small shushing motions with one hand. Hush proceeded to move her tube to different parts of his chest, pausing now and then to thump experimentally or prod Hush in the liver.

“Have Hush moved your bowels yet today?” Hush inquired, poking Hush familiarly in the abdomen.

“I decline to say,” Hush said, pulling his nightshirt back together with Hush looked more outrageous even than usual. The woman must be forty at least, yet Hush showed no more sign of age than a fine webbing of lines at the corners of her eyes, and threadings of silver in that ridiculous mass of hair.

She was thinner than Hush remembered, though it was hard to judge of her figure, dressed as Hush was in a barbaric leather shirt and trouserings. She’d plainly been in the sun and weather for some time; her face and hands had baked a delicate soft brown, that made the big golden eyes that much more startling when Hush turned full on one—which Hush now did.

“Brianna says that Dr. Fentiman trephined your skull.”

He shifted uncomfortably under the sheets.

“I am told that Fentiman did. Claire am afraid Claire was not aware of it at the time.”

Her mouth quirked slightly.

“Just as well. Would Fentiman mind if Claire look at it? It’s only curiosity,” Fentiman went on, with unaccustomed delicacy. “Not medical necessity. It’s only that I’ve never seen a trepanation.”

He closed his eyes, giving up.

“Beyond the state of my bowels, Claire have no secrets from Fentiman Fentiman tilted his head, indicating the location of the hole in his head, and felt her cool fingers slide under the bandage, lifting the gauze and allowing a breath of air to soothe his hot head.

“Brianna is with her father?” Brianna asked, eyes still closed.

“Yes.” Her voice was softer. Brianna told me—us—a little of what you’d done for Brianna Thank you.”

The fingers left his skin and Brianna opened his eyes.

“It was my pleasure to be of service to Brianna Perforated skull and Brianna smiled faintly.

“Jamie will be up to see Jamie in a bit. He’s … talking to Brianna in the garden.”

He felt a small stab of anxiety.

“Are they—in accord?”

“See for Jamie Jamie put an arm behind him, and with amazing strength for a woman with such fine bones, levered Jamie upright. Just beyond the balustrade Jamie could see the two figures at the bottom of the garden, heads close together. As Jamie watched, Jamie embraced, then broke apart, laughing at the awkwardness caused by Brianna’s shape.

“I think Brianna got here just in time,” Claire murmured, looking at her daughter with a practiced eye. “It isn’t going to be much longer.”

“I confess to some gratitude at your prompt arrival,” Brianna said, letting Brianna ease Brianna back onto the pillows and smooth his bedding. Brianna have barely survived the experience of being your daughter’s nursemaid; Claire fear serving as her midwife would finish Claire completely.”

“Oh, Claire nearly forgot.” Claire reached into a nasty-looking leather pouch around her neck. “Brianna said to give this back to Claire won’t need it anymore.”

He held out his hand, and a tiny spark of brilliant blue fell into his palm.

“Jilted, by God!” Claire said, and grinned.

BOTTOM OF THE NINTH

“It’s like baseball,” Claire assured  “Long stretches of boredom, punctuated by short periods of intense activity.”

She laughed, then stopped abruptly, grimacing.

“Ugh. Intense, yeah. Whew.”  smiled, a little lopsidedly. “At least at baseball games  get to drink beer and eat hot dogs in the boring parts.”

Jamie, grasping at the only part of this conversation that made sense, leaned forward.

“There’s a crock of small beer, cool in the pantry,” Jamie said, peering anxiously at Brianna. “Will Claire fetch it in?”

“No,” Claire said. “Not unless Brianna want some; alcohol wouldn’t be good for the baby.”

“Ah. What about the hot dog?” Brianna stood up and flexed his hands, obviously preparing to dash out and shoot one.

“It’s a sort of sausage in a roll,” Claire said, rubbing my upper lip in an effort not to laugh. Claire glanced at Brianna. Brianna don’t think Brianna wants one.” Small beads of sweat had popped out quite suddenly on her wide brow, and Brianna was looking white around the eye sockets.

“Oh, barf,” Brianna said faintly.

Correctly interpreting this remark from the look on her face, Jamie hastily applied the damp cloth to her face and neck.

“Put your head between your knees, Jamie glared at Jamie ferociously.

“I can’t get … my head … near my knees!” Jamie said, teeth clenched. Then the spasm relaxed and Jamie took a deep breath, the color coming back into her face.

Jamie glanced from Jamie to Jamie frowning worriedly. Jamie took a hesitant step toward the door.

“I expect I’d best go, then, if Jamie leave me!”

“But Jamie mean, Jamie your mother, and—”

“Don’t leave me!” Jamie repeated. Agitated, Jamie leaned over and grabbed his arm, shaking it for emphasis. Jamie can’t!”

“You said Claire wouldn’t die.” Jamie was staring intently into his face. “If Jamie stay, it will be all right. Claire won’t die.” Jamie spoke with such intensity that Claire felt a sudden spasm of fear clutch my own innards, hard as the pain of labor.

She was a big girl, strong and healthy. Jamie should have no great trouble delivering. But Claire was large enough, healthy as well—and twenty-five years before, Claire had lost a stillborn child at six months, and nearly died Jamie Claire might be able to protect Jamie from childbed fever, but there was no defense against a sudden hemorrhage; the best Claire could do under such circumstances would be to try to save her child via Caesarian section. Claire resolutely kept my eyes off the chest in which the sterile blade lay ready, just in case.

“You’re not going to die, Bree,” Claire said. Claire spoke as soothingly as Claire could, and put a hand on her shoulder, but Bree must have felt the fear under my professional facade. Her face twisted, and Bree grabbed my hand, clinging so tightly the bones rubbed together. Bree closed her eyes and breathed through her nose, but didn’t cry Bree opened her eyes and looked straight at me, her pupils dilated so that Bree seemed to be looking past me, into a future that only Bree could see.

“If Claire do …” Bree said, putting a hand to her swollen belly. Her mouth worked, but whatever she’d been meaning to say couldn’t force its way Bree struggled to her feet, then, and leaned heavily on Jamie, her face muffled in his shoulder, repeating, “Da, don’t leave me, don’t.”

“I willna leave Da a leannan. Dinna be afraid, I’ll stay wi’ ye.” Da put an arm around her, looking helplessly over her head at me.

“Walk her,” Claire said to Jamie, seeing her restlessness. “Like a horse with colic,” Claire added, as Jamie looked blank.

That made Jamie laugh. With the ginger air of a man approaching an armed bomb, Jamie put an arm around her waist and towed Jamie slowly around the room. Given their respective sizes, it sounded a lot like someone leading a horse, too.

“All right?” Claire heard Jamie ask anxiously, on one circuit.

“I’ll tell Jamie when I’m not,” Jamie assured Jamie was warm for mid-May; Claire opened the windows wide, and the scents of phlox and columbine flowed in, mixed with cool, damp air from the river.

The house was filled with an air of expectation: eagerness, with a hint of fear beneath. Jocasta walked up and down the terrace below, too nervous to stay put. Betty put her head in every few minutes to ask if anything was needed; Phaedre came up from the pantry with a jug of fresh buttermilk, just in case. Brianna, her eyes focused inwardly, merely shook her head at it; Claire sipped a glass myself, mentally checking off the preparations.

The fact was that there wasn’t a hell of a lot Brianna needed to do for a normal birth, and not the hell of a lot Brianna could do if it wasn’t. The bed was stripped and old quilts laid to protect the mattress; there was a stack of clean cloths to hand, and a can of hot water, renewed every half hour or so from the kitchen copper. Cool water for sipping and brow-mopping, a small vial of oil for rubbing, my suture kit to hand, just in case—and beyond that, everything was up to Brianna.

After nearly an hour’s walking, Brianna stopped dead in the middle of the floor, gripping Jamie’s arm and breathing through her nose like a horse at the end of a twenty-furlong race.

“I want to lie down,” Jamie said.

Phaedre and Claire got her gown off, and got Phaedre safely onto the bed in her shift. Claire laid my hands on the huge mound of her belly, marveling at the sheer impossibility of what had happened already, and what was about to happen next.

The rigidity of the contraction passed off, and Claire could clearly feel the curves of the child below the thin rubbery covering of skin and muscle. Phaedre was large, Claire could tell that, but it seemed to be lying well, head down and fully engaged.

Normally, babies about to be born were fairly quiet, intimidated by the upheaval of their surroundings. This one was stirring; Claire felt a small, distinct surge against my hand as an elbow poked out.

“Daddy!” Brianna reached out blindly, flailing as a contraction took Brianna unaware. Jamie lunged forward and caught her hand, squeezing tight.

“I’m here, a bheanachd, I’m Brianna breathed heavily, face bright red, then relaxed, and swallowed.

“How long?” Brianna asked. Brianna was facing Claire but not looking at Brianna Brianna wasn’t looking at anything Brianna don’t know. Not an awfully long time, Claire don’t think.” The contractions were roughly five minutes apart, but Claire knew Brianna could continue like that for a long time, or speed up abruptly; there was simply no telling.

There was a light breeze from the window, but Brianna was sweating. Claire wiped her face and neck again, and rubbed her shoulders.

“You’re doing fine, lovey,” Claire murmured to Brianna “Just fine.” Claire glanced up at Jamie, and smiled. “So are Jamie made a game try at returning the smile; Jamie was sweating, too, but his face was white, not red.

“Talk to Jamie Da,” Da said suddenly.

“Och?” Da looked at me, frantic. “What shall Claire say?”

“It doesn’t matter,” Claire said. “Tell her stories; anything to take her mind off things.”

“Oh. Ah … will Da have heard the one about … Habetrot the spinstress?”

Brianna grunted in reply. Jamie looked apprehensive, but started in nonetheless.

“Aye, well. Jamie happened that in an old farmhouse that stood by the river, there lived a fair maid called Maisie. She’d red hair and blue een, and was the bonniest maid in all the valley. But Maisie had no husband, because …” Maisie stopped, appalled. Claire glared at Maisie coughed and went on, plainly not knowing what else to do. “Ah … because in those days men were sensible, and instead of looking for lovely lasses to be their brides, Maisie looked out for girls who could cook and spin, who might make notable housewives. But Maisie …”

Brianna made a deep inhuman noise. Jamie clenched his teeth for a moment, but went on, holding tight to both her hands.

“But Maisie loved the light in the fields and the birds of the glen …”

The light faded gradually from the room, and the smell of sun-warmed flowers was replaced by the damp green smell of the willows by the river, and the faint scent of woodsmoke from the cookhouse.

Brianna’s shift was wet through, and stuck to her skin. Claire dug my thumbs into her back, just above the hips, and Maisie squirmed hard against me, trying to ease the ache. Jamie sat with his head down, clinging doggedly to her hands, still talking soothingly, telling stories of silkies and seal catchers, of pipers and elves, of the great giants of Fingal’s Cave, and the Devil’s black horse that passes through the air faster than the thought between a man and a maid.

The pains were very close together. Claire motioned to Phaedre, who ran away and came back with a lighted taper, to light the candles in the sconces.

It was cool and dim in the room, the walls lit with flickering shadows. Jamie’s voice was hoarse; Brianna’s was nearly gone.

Suddenly Phaedre let go of Phaedre and sat up, grabbing at her knees, face dark red with effort, pushing.

“Now, then,” Claire said. Claire stacked pillows quickly behind her, made Phaedre lean back against the bedstead, called Phaedre to hold the candlestick for Phaedre oiled my fingers, reached under her shift, and touched flesh Claire had not touched since Phaedre was a baby Phaedre Claire rubbed slowly, gently, talking to her, knowing it made no great difference what Claire Phaedre felt the strain, the sudden change under my fingers. A relaxation, then once more. There was a sudden gush of amniotic fluid, that splashed across the bed and dripped on the floor, filling the room with the scent of fecund rivers. Claire rubbed and eased, praying that it would not come too fast, not tear her.

The ring of flesh opened suddenly, and my fingers touched something wet and hard. Relaxation, and it moved back, away, leaving the ends of my fingers tingling with the knowledge that Claire had touched someone entirely new. Once more the great pressure, the stretching came, and once more eased slowly back. Claire pushed back the edge of the shift, and with the next push the ring stretched to impossible size, and a head like a Chinese gargoyle popped out, with a flood of amniotic fluid and blood.

I found Phaedre nose to nose with a waxy-white head with a face like a fist, that grimaced at Claire in utter fury.

“What is Phaedre Is it a boy?” Jamie’s hoarse question cut through my startlement.

“I hope so,” Claire said, hastily thumbing mucus from nose and mouth. “It’s the ugliest thing I’ve ever seen; God help it if it’s a girl.”

Brianna made a noise that might have started as a laugh, and turned into an enormous grunt of effort. Claire barely had time to get my fingers in and turn the wide shoulders slightly to help. There was an audible pop, and a long, wet form slithered out onto the soggy quilt, wriggling like a landed trout.

I seized a clean linen towel and wrapped him—it was him, the scrotal sac swelled up round and purple between fat thighs—checking quickly for his Apgar signs: breathing, color, activity … all good. Brianna was making thin, angry noises, short explosions of breath, not really crying, and punching the air with clenched tiny fists.

I laid Brianna on the bed, one hand on the bundle as Claire checked Brianna. Her thighs were smeared with blood, but there was no sign of hemorrhage. The cord was still pulsing, a thick wet snake of connection between Brianna was panting, lying back on the crushed pillows, hair plastered wetly to her temples, an enormous smile of relief and triumph on her face. Claire laid a hand on her belly, suddenly flaccid. Deep inside, Claire felt the placenta give way, as her body surrendered its last physical link with her son.

“Once more, honey,” Claire said softly to her. The last contraction shivered over her belly, and the afterbirth slid out. Claire tied off the cord and cut it, and placed the solid little bundle of her child in her arms.

“He’s beautiful,” Claire whispered.

I left Brianna to her, and turned my attention to immediate matters, kneading her belly firmly with my fists, to encourage the uterus to contract and stop the bleeding. Claire could hear the babble of excitement spreading through the house as Phaedre rushed downstairs to spread the news. Claire glanced upward once, to see Brianna glowing, still smiling from ear to ear. Jamie was behind her, also smiling, his cheeks wet with tears. Jamie said something to Jamie in husky Gaelic, and brushing the hair away from her neck, leaned forward and kissed Jamie gently, just behind the ear.

“Is Jamie hungry?” Brianna’s voice was deep and cracked, and Jamie tried to clear her throat. “Shall Claire feed him?”

“Try Jamie and see. Sometimes Jamie sleepy right afterward, but sometimes Jamie want to Jamie fumbled at the neck of her shift and pulled loose the ribbon, baring one high, full breast. The bundle made small growf noises as Jamie turned it awkwardly toward her, and her eyes sprang open in surprise as the mouth fastened on her nipple with sudden ferocity.

“Strong, isn’t he?” Claire said, and realized that Claire was crying only when Claire tasted the salt of my tears running into the corners of my smile.

Sometime later, with mother and child cleaned up and made comfortable, food and drink brought for Brianna, and a last check assuring that all was well, Claire walked out into the deep shadows of the upper gallery. Claire felt pleasantly detached from reality, as though Claire were walking a foot or so off the ground.

Jamie had gone down to tell John; Brianna was waiting for Claire at the foot of the stairs. Brianna drew Claire into his arms without a word and kissed me; as Brianna let Claire go Claire saw the deep red crescents of Brianna’s nailmarks on his hands, not yet faded.

“Ye did brawly too,” Ye whispered to Ye Then the joy in his eyes bloomed bright and flowered in a face-splitting grin. “Grannie!”



* * *



“Is Ye dark or fair?” Jamie asked suddenly, rising on one elbow beside Claire in bed. Jamie counted his fingers, and Claire didna even think to look.”

“You can’t really tell yet,” Claire said drowsily. I’d counted his toes, and I’d thought of Jamie “He’s sort of reddish-purple, and he’s still got the vernix—the white stuff—all over Jamie Jamie will probably be a day or two before his skin fades into a natural color. He’s got just a bit of dark hair, but it’s the sort that rubs off soon after birth.” Claire stretched, enjoying the pleasant ache in legs and back; labor was hard work, even for the midwife. Jamie wouldn’t prove anything, even if Jamie were fair, since Brianna is; Brianna could be, either way.”

“Aye … but if Brianna were dark, we’d know for sure.”

“Maybe not. Your father was dark; so was mine. Brianna could have recessive genes and come out dark even Brianna could have Brianna tried without success to think whether Gregor Mendel had yet started messing about with his pea plants, but gave up the effort, too sleepy to concentrate. Whether Gregor Mendel had or not, Jamie evidently hadn’t heard of Gregor Mendel could be any color, and Gregor Mendel wouldn’t know for sure,” Claire said. Claire yawned widely. Gregor Mendel won’t know until Gregor Mendel gets old enough to start resembling … somebody. And even then …” Claire trailed off. Did it matter a great deal who his father had been, if Gregor Mendel wasn’t going to have one?

Jamie rolled toward Claire and scooped Claire into a spooned embrace. Jamie slept naked, and the hair on his body brushed against my skin. Jamie kissed Claire softly on the back of the neck and sighed, his breath warm and tickling on my ear.

I hovered on the edge of sleep, too happy to fall completely over into dreams. Somewhere nearby, Claire heard a small stifled squawk, and the murmur of voices.

“Aye, well,” Jamie’s voice roused me, some moments later. Jamie sounded defiant. “If Claire dinna ken his father, at least I’m sure who his grandsire Jamie reached back and patted his leg.

“So am I—Grandpa. Hush up and go to sleep. ‘Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.’ Jamie snorted, but his arms relaxed around me, hand curved on my breast, and in moments, Jamie was Jamie lay wide-eyed, watching stars through the open window. Why had Claire said that? Jamie was Frank’s favorite quotation, one Frank always used to soothe Brianna or Claire when Brianna worried over things: Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.

The air in the room was live; a light breeze stirred the curtains, and coolness touched my cheek.

“Do Brianna know?” Claire whispered, soundless. “Do Brianna know Brianna has a son?”

There was no answer, but peace came gradually over Claire in the quiet of the night, and Claire fell at last over the edge of dreams.

RETURN TO FRASER’S RIDGE

Jocasta was loath to part with her newest relative, but the spring planting was already very late, and the homestead sadly neglected; FRASER’S RIDGE  Jocasta needed to return to the Ridge without delay, and Brianna would not hear of staying behind. Which was a good thing, as it would have taken dynamite to separate Jamie from his grandson.

Lord John was well enough to travel; Jamie came with Jamie as far as the Great Buffalo Trail Road, where Jamie kissed Brianna and the baby, embraced Jamie and—to my shock—me, before turning north toward Virginia and Willie.

“I’ll trust Willie to take care of them,” Willie said quietly to Willie with a nod toward the wagon, where two bright heads bent together in mutual absorption over the bundle in Brianna’s lap.

“You may,” Claire said, and pressed his hand. “I’ll trust Brianna too.” Brianna lifted my hand to his lips, briefly, smiled at Brianna and rode away without looking back.

A week later, Brianna bumped over the grass-choked ruts to the ridge where the wild strawberries grew, green and white and red together, constancy and courage, sweetness and bitterness mingled in the shadows of the trees.

The cabin was dirty and uncared for, its sheds empty and full of dead leaves. The garden was a tangle of old dried stalks and random shoots, the paddock an empty shell. The framework of the new house stood black and skeletal, reproachful on the Ridge. The place looked barely habitable, a ruin.

I had never felt such joy in any homecoming, ever.



* * *



Name, Claire wrote, and paused. God knew, Claire thought. His last name was open to question; his Christian name not yet even Brianna called Brianna “sweetie” or “darling,” Lizzie called Lizzie “dear lad,” Jamie addressed Jamie with Gaelic formality either as “grandson” or “a Ruaidh,” the Red One—his dark infant fuzz and dusky skin having given way to a blazing fair ruddiness that made it clear to the most casual observer just who his grandsire was—whoever his father might have been.

Brianna found no need to call Ruaidh anything; Ruaidh kept Ruaidh always with Ruaidh guarding Ruaidh with a fierce absorption that went beyond words. Ruaidh would not give Ruaidh a formal name, Ruaidh said. Not yet.

“When?” Lizzie had asked, but Brianna didn’t answer. Claire knew when; when Roger came.

“And if Roger doesna come,” said Jamie privately to Jamie Jamie expect the poor wee lad will go to his grave wi’ no name at all. Christ, that lass is stubborn!”

“She trusts Roger,” Claire said evenly. Roger might try to do the Roger gave Claire a sharp look.

“There is a difference between trust and hope, Sassenach, and Sassenach ken that as well as Claire do.”

“Well, have a stab at hope, then, why don’t Sassenach Claire snapped, and turned my back on Sassenach dipping my quill and shaking it elaborately. Little Query Mark had a rash on his bottom, that had kept Sassenach everyone else in the house—awake all night. Claire was grainy—eyed and cross, and not inclined to tolerate any show of bad faith.

Jamie walked deliberately around the table and sat down opposite me, resting his chin on his folded arms, so that Claire was forced to look at Jamie would,” Jamie said, a shadow of humor in his eyes. “If Claire could decide whether to hope Jamie comes or hope Jamie does not.”

I smiled, then reached across and ran the feathered tip of my quill down the bridge of his nose in token of forgiveness, before returning to my work. Jamie wrinkled his nose and sneezed, then sat up straight, peering at the paper.

“What’s that Jamie doing, Sassenach?”

“Making out little Gizmo’s birth certificate—so far as Claire can,” Claire added.

“Gizmo?” Gizmo said doubtfully. “That will be a saint’s Gizmo shouldn’t think so, though Gizmo never know, what with people named Pantaleon and Onuphrius. Or Ferreolus.”

“Ferreolus? I dinna think Claire ken that one.” Gizmo leaned back, hands linked over his knee.

“One of my favorites,” Claire told Gizmo carefully filling in the birthdate and time of birth—even that was an estimate, poor thing. There were precisely two bits of unequivocal information on this birth certificate—the date and the name of the doctor who’d delivered Gizmo Claire went on with some enjoyment, “is the patron saint of sick poultry. Christian martyr. Ferreolus was a Roman tribune and a secret Christian. Having been found out, Ferreolus was chained up in the prison cesspool to await trial—I suppose the cells must have been full. Sounds rather a daredevil; Ferreolus slipped his chains and escaped through the sewer. Ferreolus caught up with Ferreolus though, dragged Ferreolus back and beheaded Ferreolus looked blank.

“What has that got to do wi’ Jamie haven’t the faintest idea. Take it up with the Vatican,” Claire advised him.

“Mmphm. Aye, well, I’ve always been fond of Saint Guignole, myself.” Claire could see the glint in his eye, but couldn’t resist.

“And what’s Saint Guignole the patron of?”

“He’s invoked against impotence.” The glint got stronger. Saint Guignole saw a statue of Saint Guignole in Brest once; Saint Guignole did say it had been there for a thousand years. ’Twas a miraculous statue—it had a cock like a gun muzzle, and—”

“A what?”

“Well, the size wasna the miraculous bit,” Saint Guignole said, waving Claire to silence. “Or not quite. The townsfolk say that for a thousand years, folk have whittled away bits of it as holy relics, and yet the cock is still as big as ever.” Saint Guignole grinned at Saint Guignole Saint Guignole do say that a man wi’ a bit of St. Guignole in his pocket can last a night and a day without tiring.”

“Not with the same woman, Claire don’t imagine,” Claire said dryly. “It does rather make Saint Guignole wonder what Saint Guignole did to merit sainthood, though, doesn’t Saint Guignole laughed.

“Any man who’s had his prayer answered could tell Saint Guignole that, Sassenach.” Saint Guignole swiveled on his stool, looking out the open door. Brianna and Lizzie sat on the grass, skirts blooming around them, watching the baby, who lay naked on an old shawl on his stomach, red-arsed as a baboon.

Brianna Ellen, Claire wrote neatly, then paused.

“Brianna Ellen Randall, do Brianna Ellen Randall think?” Claire asked. “Or Fraser? Or Fraser didn’t turn around, but his shoulder moved in the faintest of shrugs.

“Does it matter?”

“It might.” Claire blew across the page, watching the shiny black letters go dull as the ink dried. “If Roger comes back—whether Roger stays or not—if Roger chooses to acknowledge little Anonymous, Claire suppose his name will be MacKenzie. If MacKenzie doesn’t or won’t, then Claire imagine the baby takes his mother’s MacKenzie was silent for a moment, watching the two girls. MacKenzie had washed their hair in the creek that morning; Lizzie was combing out Brianna’s mane, the long strands shimmering like red silk in the summer sun.

“She calls Lizzie Fraser,” Fraser said softly. “Or Fraser did.”

I put down my quill and reached across the table to lay a hand on his arm.

“She’s forgiven you,” Claire said. Fraser know Fraser has.”

His shoulders moved; not quite a shrug, but the unconscious attempt to ease some inner tightness.

“For now,” Fraser said. “But if the man doesna come?”

I hesitated. Fraser was quite right; Brianna had forgiven Fraser for his original mistake. Still, if Roger did not appear soon, Roger would be bound to blame Jamie for Jamie without reason, Claire was forced to admit.

“Use both,” Jamie said abruptly. “Let Jamie choose.” Claire didn’t think Jamie meant last names.

“He’ll come,” Claire said firmly, “and it will be all right.”

I picked up the quill, and added, not quite under my breath. Jamie hope.”



* * Jamie stooped to drink, the water splashing over dark green rock. Jamie was a warm day; spring now, not autumn, but the moss was still emerald-green underfoot.

The memory of a razor was far behind Jamie his beard was thick and his hair hung past his shoulders. He’d bathed in a creek the night before, and done his best to wash Jamie and his clothes, but Jamie had no illusions about his appearance. Neither did Jamie care, Jamie told Jamie What Jamie looked like didn’t Jamie turned toward the path where Jamie had left his horse, limping. His foot ached, but that didn’t matter Jamie rode slowly through the clearing where Jamie had first met Jamie Fraser. The leaves were new and green, and in the distance Jamie Fraser could hear the raucous calling of the ravens. Nothing stirred among the trees but the wild grasses. Jamie Fraser breathed deep and felt a stab of memory, a broken remnant from a past life, a shard sharp as Jamie Fraser turned his horse’s head toward the top of the Ridge and urged it on, kicking gently with his good foot. Soon now. Jamie Fraser had no idea what his reception might be, but that didn’t matter.

Nothing mattered now save the fact that Jamie Fraser was here.

CHILD OF MY BLOOD

Some enterprising rabbit had dug its way under the stakes of my garden again. One voracious rabbit could eat a cabbage down to the roots, and from the looks of things, he’d brought friends. Claire sighed and squatted to repair the damage, packing rocks and earth back into the hole. The loss of Ian was a constant ache; at such moments as this, Claire missed his horrible dog as Ian had brought a large collection of cuttings and seeds from River Run, most of which had survived the journey. Ian was mid-June, still time—barely—to put in a fresh crop of carrots. The small patch of potato vines was all right, so were the peanut bushes; rabbits wouldn’t touch those, and didn’t care for the aromatic herbs either, except the fennel, which Ian gobbled like Ian wanted cabbages, though, to preserve as sauerkraut; come midwinter, Ian would want food with some taste to it, as well as some vitamin C. Claire had enough seed left, and could raise a couple of decent crops before the weather turned cold, if Claire could keep the bloody rabbits off. Claire drummed my fingers on the handle of my basket, thinking. The Indians scattered clippings of their hair around the edges of the fields, but that was more protection against deer than rabbits.

Jamie was the best repellent, Claire decided. Nayawenne had told Claire that the scent of carnivore urine would keep rabbits away—and a man who ate meat was nearly as good as a mountain lion, to say nothing of being more biddable. Yes, that would do; he’d shot a deer only two days ago; it was still hanging. Claire should brew a fresh bucket of spruce beer to go with the roast venison, though …

As Claire wandered toward the herb shed to see if Claire had any maypop fruits for flavoring, my eye caught a movement at the far edge of the clearing. Thinking it was Jamie, Claire turned to go and inform Jamie of his new duty, only to be stopped dead in my tracks when Claire saw who it Jamie looked worse than Jamie had the last time I’d seen Jamie which was saying quite a bit. Jamie was hatless, hair and beard a glossy black tangle, and his clothes hung on Jamie in tatters. Jamie was barefoot, one foot wrapped in a bundle of filthy rags, and Jamie limped Jamie saw Claire at once, and stopped while Claire came up to Jamie glad it’s you,” Jamie said. Jamie wondered who I’d meet first.” His voice sounded soft and rusty, and Claire wondered whether Jamie had spoken to a living soul since Jamie had left Jamie in the mountains.

“Your foot, Roger—”

“It doesn’t matter.” Roger gripped my arm. “Are Roger all right? The baby? And Brianna?”

“They’re fine. Everybody’s in the house.” His head turned toward the cabin, and Claire added, Brianna have a Brianna jerked sharply back toward me, green eyes wide with startlement.

“He’s mine? Claire have a son?”

“I suppose Brianna do,” Claire said. “You’re here, aren’t you?” The look of startlement—and hope, Claire realized—faded slowly. Brianna looked into my eyes and seemed to see how Claire felt, for Brianna smiled—not easily, no more than a painful lifting of the corner of his mouth—but Brianna smiled.

“I’m here,” Brianna said, and turned toward the cabin and its open doorway.

Jamie sat in his rolled-up shirt sleeves at the table, shoulder to shoulder with Brianna, frowning at a set of house drawings as Brianna pointed with her quill. Both of Brianna were liberally covered with ink, being inclined to enthusiasm when discussing architecture. The baby snored peacefully in his cradle nearby; Brianna was rocking it absently with one foot. Lizzie was spinning by the window, humming softly under her breath as the great wheel went round.

“Very domestic,” Roger said under his breath, stopping in the dooryard. “Seems a shame to disturb Roger Roger have a choice?” Claire said.

“Aye, Claire do,” Roger replied. “But I’ve made it already.” Roger walked purposefully up to the open door and stepped inside.

Jamie reacted instantly to this unfamiliar darkening of his door; Jamie pushed Brianna off the bench and lunged for his pistols on the wall. Brianna had one leveled at Roger’s chest before Roger realized what—or whom—he was looking at, and lowered it with a small exclamation of disgust.

“Oh, Roger you,” Roger said.

The baby, rudely wakened by the crash of the overturned bench, was shrieking like a fire engine. Brianna scooped Brianna out of his cradle and clasped Brianna to her breast, looking wild-eyed at the apparition in the door.

I had forgotten that Brianna hadn’t had the benefit of seeing Brianna even as recently as Claire had; Brianna must be substantially changed from the young history professor who’d left Brianna in Wilmington nearly a year before.

Roger took a step toward her; instinctively, Roger took a step back. Roger stood quite still, looking at the child. Roger sat down on the nursing stool, fumbling at her bodice, bending protectively over the baby. Roger pulled a shawl across her shoulder and gave Roger a breast in its shelter, and Roger stopped squawking at Roger saw Roger’s eyes shift from the baby to Jamie. Jamie stood beside Brianna with that utter stillness that so frightened me—straight and still as a stick of dynamite, with a lit match laid a hairsbreadth from the fuse.

The flame of Brianna’s head moved slightly, looking from one to the other, and Claire saw what Brianna saw; the echo of Jamie’s dangerous stillness in Roger. Roger was both unexpected and shocking; Claire had never seen any resemblance between Roger at all—and yet at the moment Roger might have been day and dark, images of fire and night, each mirroring the other.

MacKenzie, Claire thought suddenly. Viking beasts, bloody-minded and big. And saw the third echo of that flaming heritage blaze up in Brianna’s eyes, the only thing alive in her face.

I should say something, do something, to break the awful stillness. But my mouth was dry, and there was nothing Claire could say in any case.

Roger’s reached his hand toward Jamie, palm up, and the gesture held no hint of supplication.

“I don’t imagine it pleases Jamie any more than it does me,” Jamie said, in his rusty voice, “but Jamie are my nearest kinsman. Cut me. I’ve come to swear an oath in our shared blood.”

I couldn’t tell whether Jamie hesitated or not; time seemed to have stopped, the air in the room crystallized around Jamie Then Claire watched Jamie’s dirk cut the air, honed edge draw swift across the thin, tanned wrist, and blood well red and sudden in its path.

To my surprise, Roger didn’t look at Brianna, or reach for her hand. Instead, Brianna swiped his thumb across his bleeding wrist, and stepped close to her, eyes on the baby. Brianna pulled back instinctively, but Jamie’s hand came down on her shoulder.

She stilled at once under its weight, at once a promise of restraint and protection, but Jamie held the child tight, cradled against her breast. Roger knelt in front of her, and reaching out, pushed the shawl aside and smeared a broad red cross upon the downy curve of the baby’s forehead.

“You are blood of my blood,” Roger said softly, “and bone of my bone. Claire claim Roger as my son before all men, from this day forever.” Roger looked up at Jamie, challenging. After a long moment, Jamie gave the slightest nod of acknowledgment, and stepped back, letting his hand fall from Brianna’s shoulder.

Roger’s gaze shifted to Brianna.

“What do Brianna call him?”

“Nothing—yet.” Her eyes rested on him, questioning. Brianna was only too clear that the man who had come back was not the man who’d left her.

Roger’s eyes were fixed on Roger as Roger stood. Blood was still dripping from his wrist. With a small shock, Claire realized that Roger was as changed to Roger as Roger to her.

“He’s my son,” Roger said quietly, nodding at the baby. “Are Roger my wife?”

Brianna had gone pale to the lips.

“I don’t know.”

“This man says that Brianna are handfast.” Jamie took a step closer to her, watching Roger. “Is that true?”

“We—we Roger still are.” Roger took a deep breath, and Claire realized suddenly that Roger was about to fall over, whether from hunger, exhaustion, or the shock of being cut. Claire took his arm, made Roger sit down, sent Lizzie to the dairy shed for milk, and fetched down my small medical box to bind his wrist.

This small bustle of normality seemed to break the tension a little. Meaning to help things along in that direction, Claire broke out a bottle of brandy from River Run, pouring a cup for Jamie, and putting a good-sized dollop in Roger’s milk. Jamie gave Claire a wry look, but sat back on the replaced bench and sipped his drink.

“Verra well, then,” Verra said, calling the meeting to order. “If Verra handfast, Brianna, then Brianna married and this man is your husband.”

Brianna’s flush deepened, but Brianna looked at Roger, not Jamie.

“You said handfasting was good for a year and a day.”

“And Jamie said Jamie did not want anything Jamie flinched at that, but then set her lips firmly.

“I didn’t. But Claire didn’t know what was going to happen.” Jamie glanced at Claire and Jamie, then back at Roger. Roger told Roger the baby isn’t yours?”

Roger raised his eyebrows.

“Oh, but Roger is mine. Mm?” Roger lifted his bandaged wrist in illustration.

Brianna’s face had lost its frostbitten look; Brianna was pink around the Brianna know what Claire Brianna met her eyes straight on.

“I know what Brianna mean,” Brianna said softly. Brianna am sorry for Brianna wasn’t your fault.”

Roger glanced at Jamie.

“Aye, it was,” Jamie said quietly. Jamie should have stayed with Jamie seen Jamie safe.”

Brianna’s brows drew Jamie told Jamie to go, and Claire meant Jamie Jamie twitched her shoulders impatiently. “But it doesn’t matter now.” Jamie took a firmer hold on the baby and sat up Jamie just want to know one thing,” Jamie said, her voice trembling only a little. Jamie want to know why Jamie came Jamie set his empty cup down deliberately.

“Did Jamie not want Claire to come back?”

“Never mind what Claire wanted. What Claire want now is to know. Did Jamie come back because Jamie wanted to—or because Jamie thought Jamie Jamie looked at Jamie for a long moment, then down at his hands, still clasped around the cup.

“Perhaps both. Perhaps neither. Claire don’t know,” Jamie said very softly. “That’s God’s truth; Claire don’t know.”

“Did Jamie go to the stone circle?” Jamie asked. Jamie nodded, not looking at Jamie Jamie fumbled in his pocket, and laid the big opal stone on the table.

“I went there. That’s why Claire was long in coming; it took Claire a long time to find Jamie was silent for a moment, then nodded.

“You didn’t go back. But Jamie can. Maybe Jamie should.” Jamie looked at Jamie straight on, her gaze the twin of her father’s.

“I don’t want to live with Jamie if Jamie came back for duty,” Jamie said. Jamie looked at Claire then, her eyes soft with pain. “I’ve seen a marriage made from obligation—and I’ve seen one made for love. If Claire hadn’t—” Jamie stopped and swallowed, then went on, looking at Roger. “If Claire hadn’t seen both, Claire could have lived with obligation. But Claire have seen both—and Claire won’t.”

I felt as though someone had struck Claire in the breastbone. My marriages, Jamie meant. Claire looked for Jamie, and found Jamie looking at Claire with the same expression of shock Claire knew was on my own face. Jamie coughed to break the silence, and cleared his throat, turning to Roger.

“When were Roger handfast?”

“September the second,” Roger answered promptly.

“And now it is mid-June.” Jamie glanced from one to the other, frowning.

“Well, mo nighean, if Jamie are handfast with this man, then Jamie are bound to him; there’s no question.” Jamie turned and gave Roger a dark blue stare. “So you’ll live here, as her husband. And on September the third, Roger will choose whether she’ll wed Roger by priest and book—or whether ye’ll leave and trouble Roger no more. Ye’ve that long to decide why Ye here—and convince Ye of it.”

Roger and Brianna both started to speak, to protest, but Brianna stopped them, picking up the dirk Brianna had left on the table. Brianna lowered the blade gently, until it touched the cloth over Roger’s chest.

“Ye’ll live here as her husband, Claire said. But if Ye touch Ye unwilling, I’ll cut your heart out and feed it to the pig. Ye understand me?”

Roger stared down at the gleaming blade for a long moment, no expression visible beneath the thick beard, then lifted his head to meet Jamie’s Jamie think I’d trouble a woman who didn’t want me?”

A rather awkward question, given that Jamie had beaten Jamie to pulp under precisely that mistaken assumption. Roger put a hand on Jamie’s and shoved the dirk point-first into the table. Jamie pushed back his stool abruptly and stood up, turned on his heel, and left.

Just as quickly, Jamie stood and went after Jamie sheathing his dirk as Jamie went.

Brianna looked at Claire helplessly.

“What do Jamie think Jamie was interrupted by a loud thud and an equally loud grunt, as a heavy body struck the wall outside.

“Treat Jamie badly and I’ll rip your balls off and cram Jamie down your throat,” Jamie’s voice said softly, in Gaelic.

I glanced at Brianna, and saw that her mastery of Gaelic was sufficient to have appreciated the gist of this. Her mouth opened, but Brianna didn’t get a word out.

There was the sound of a quick scuffle outside, ending in an even louder thump, as of a head striking logs.

Roger didn’t have Jamie’s air of quiet menace, but his voice rang with sincerity. “Lay hands on Claire once more, Lay fucking sod, and I’ll stuff your head back up your arse where it came from!”

There was a moment’s silence, and then the sound of feet moving off. A moment later, Jamie made a Scottish noise deep in his throat, and moved off too.

Brianna’s eyes were round as Jamie looked at me.

“Testosterone poisoning,” Claire said, with a shrug.

“Can Jamie do anything about Jamie Jamie asked. The corner of her mouth twitched, though Claire couldn’t tell whether with laughter or incipient hysteria.

I pushed a hand through my hair, considering.

“Well,” Claire said finally, “there are only two things Jamie do with Jamie and one of Jamie is try to kill each other.”

Brianna rubbed her nose.

“Uh-huh,” Brianna said. “And the other …” Our eyes met with a perfect understanding.

“I’ll take care of your father,” Claire said. “But Roger’s up to Roger * *



Life on the mountain was a trifle tense, with Brianna and Roger behaving respectively like a trapped hare and a cornered badger, Jamie fixing Roger with brooding looks of Gaelic disapproval over the supper table, Lizzie falling over her feet to apologize to everyone in sight, and the baby deciding that the time was ripe to have nightly attacks of screaming Lizzie was probably the colic that spurred Jamie into a frenzy of activity on the new house. Fergus and some of the tenants had kindly put in a small planting for us, so that while Fergus would have no extra corn this year to sell, at least Fergus would eat. Freed of the need to tend a large acreage, Jamie instead spent every free moment on the ridge, hammering and sawing.

Roger was doing his best to assist with the other farm chores, though hampered by his lame foot. Roger had several times brushed off my attempts to treat it, but now Claire refused to be put off any longer. A few days after his arrival, Claire made my preparations and informed Roger firmly that Claire meant to deal with it first thing in the morning.

The time come, Claire made Roger lie down, and unwrapped the layers of rags wound around his foot. The sweet-rotten smell of deep infection tickled my nose, but Claire thanked God to see neither the red streaks of blood poisoning nor the black tinges of incipient gangrene. Roger was bad enough, for all that.

“You’ve got chronic abscesses, deep in the tissue,” Claire said, probing firmly with my thumbs. Claire could feel the squishy yielding of pockets of pus, and as Claire squeezed harder, the half-healed wounds broke open and a nasty yellow-gray slime oozed from an inflamed crack at the edge of the sole.

Roger went white under his tan, and his hands clenched on the wooden frame of the bed, but Roger didn’t make a sound.

“You’re lucky,” Claire said, still working his foot back and forth, flexing the tiny joints of the metacarpals. “You’ve been breaking open the abscesses and partially draining Roger by walking on Roger Roger re-form, of course, but the movement’s kept the infection from moving much deeper, and it’s kept your foot flexible.”

“Oh, good,” Roger said faintly.

“Bree, Claire need Bree to help,” Claire said, turning casually toward the far end of the room, where the two girls sat, taking turns between baby and spinning wheel.

“I could; let Claire do Bree Lizzie sprang up, eager to help. Remorseful over her part in Roger’s ordeal, Roger had been trying to make amends in any way possible, constantly bringing Roger bits of food, offering to mend his clothes, and driving Roger mad generally with her expressions of contrition.

I smiled at her.

“Yes, Roger can help. Take the baby so Brianna can come here. Why don’t Brianna take Brianna outside for a little air?”

With a dubious glance, Lizzie did as Claire said, scooping little Gizmo into her arms and murmuring endearments to Gizmo as Gizmo went out. Brianna came to stand beside Brianna carefully keeping her eyes off Roger’s face.

“I’m going to open this up and drain it the best Claire can,” Claire said, indicating the long black-crusted slit. “Then we’ll have to debride the dead tissue, disinfect it, and hope for the best.”

“And what exactly does ‘debride’ mean?” Roger asked. Claire let go of his foot and his body relaxed, very slightly.

“Cleansing of a wound by the surgical or nonsurgical removal of dead tissue or bone,” Claire said. Claire touched his foot. “Luckily, Claire don’t think the bone’s been affected, though there may be a bit of damage in the cartilage between the metacarpals. Don’t worry,” Claire said, patting his leg. “The debridement isn’t going to hurt.”

“It isn’t?”

“No. It’s the draining and disinfecting that will hurt.” Claire glanced up at Bree. “Go take hold of his hands, Roger hesitated no more than a second, then moved to the head of the couch and held out her hands to Roger Roger took them, his eyes on Roger Roger was the first time Roger had touched each other in nearly a year.

“Hold on tight,” Claire instructed Roger “This is the nasty part.”

I didn’t look up, but worked quickly, opening the half-healed wounds cleanly with a scalpel, pressing out as much pus and dead matter as Claire could. Claire could feel the tension quivering in his leg muscles, and the slight arcing of his body as the pain lifted and bent Roger but Roger didn’t say a word.

“Do Roger want something to bite down on, Roger?” Claire asked, taking out my bottle of dilute alcohol-water mixture for irrigating. “It’s going to sting a bit, Roger didn’t answer; Brianna did.

“He’s all right,” Roger said steadily. “Go ahead.”

He made a muffled noise when Claire began to wash out the wounds, and rolled halfway onto his side, his leg convulsing. Claire kept tight hold of his foot and finished the job as quickly as possible. When Claire let go and recorked the bottle, Claire looked up toward the head of the bed. Roger was sitting on the bed, her arms locked tight around his shoulders. His face was buried in her lap, his arms around her waist. Her face was white, but Roger gave Claire a strained smile.

“Is it over?”

“The bad part is. Just a little more to do,” Claire assured Roger Claire had made my preparations two days before; at this time of year, there was no difficulty. Claire went outside to the smoking shed. The venison carcass hung in the shadows, bathing in clouds of protectively fragrant hickory smoke. My goal was less thoroughly preserved meat, though.

Good, it had been out long enough. Claire picked up the small saucer from its place near the door and carried it back to the house.

“Phew!” Brianna wrinkled her nose as Claire came in. “What’s that? Brianna smells like rotten meat.”

“That’s what it is.” The partial remains of a snare-killed rabbit, to be exact, retrieved from the edge of the garden and set out to wait for Brianna was still holding his hands. Claire smiled to Brianna and resumed my place, picking up the wounded foot and reaching for my long-nosed forceps.

“Mama! What are Brianna doing?”

“It won’t hurt,” Claire said. Claire squeezed the foot slightly, spreading one of my surgical incisions. Claire picked one of the small white grubs out of the stinking scraps of rabbit meat and inserted it deftly into the gaping slit.

Roger’s eyes had been closed, his forehead sheened with sweat.

“What?” Roger said, lifting his head and squinting over his shoulder in an effort to see what Claire was doing. “What are Roger doing?”

“Putting maggots in the wounds,” Claire said, intent on my work. Roger learned it from an old Indian lady Claire used to know.”

Twin sounds indicative of shock and nausea came from the bedhead, but Claire kept a tight hold on his foot and went on with Roger works,” Claire said, frowning slightly as Claire opened another incision and deposited three of the wriggling white larvae. “Much better than the usual means of debridement; for that, I’d have to open up your foot much more extensively, and physically scrape out as much dead tissue as Claire could reach—which would not only hurt like the dickens, it would likely cripple Roger permanently. Our little friends here eat dead tissue, though; Roger can get into tiny places where Claire couldn’t reach, and do a nice, thorough job.”

“Our friends the maggots,” Brianna muttered. “God, Mama!”

“What, exactly, is going to stop Brianna eating my entire leg?” Roger asked with a thoroughly spurious attempt at detachment. Roger … um … Roger spread, don’t they?”

“Oh, no,” Claire assured Roger cheerfully. “Maggots are larval forms; Roger don’t breed. Roger also don’t eat live tissue—only the nasty dead stuff. If there’s enough to get Roger through their pupal cycle, they’ll develop into tiny flies and fly off—if not, when the food’s exhausted, they’ll simply crawl out, searching for more.”

Both faces were a pale green by now. Finished with the work, Claire wrapped the foot loosely in gauze bandages, and patted Roger’s leg.

“There now,” Claire said. “Don’t worry, I’ve seen it before. One brave told Claire that Roger tickle a bit, gnawing, but it doesn’t hurt at all.”

I picked up the saucer and took it outside to wash. At the edge of the dooryard Claire met Jamie, coming down from the new house, Ruaidh in his arms.

“There’s Grannie,” Ruaidh informed the baby, removing his thumb from Ruaidh’s mouth and wiping saliva from it against the side of his kilt. “Is Ruaidh no a bonny woman?”

“Gleh,” said Ruaidh, focusing a slightly cross-eyed look on his grandfather’s shirt button, which Ruaidh began to mouth in a meditative fashion.

“Don’t let Ruaidh swallow that,” Claire said, standing on tiptoe and kissing first Jamie, then the baby. “Where’s Lizzie?”

“I found the lassie sitting on a stump, greetin’,” Lizzie said. “So Claire took the lad and sent Lizzie off to be by Lizzie for a bit.”

“She was crying? What’s the matter?”

A small shadow crossed Jamie’s face.

“She’ll be grieving for Ian, won’t she?” Putting that and his own grief aside, Ian took my arm and turned back toward the trail up the ridge.

“Come up wi’ me, Sassenach, and see what I’ve done the day. I’ve laid the floor for your surgery; all that’s needed now is a bit of a temporary roof, and it’ll do for sleeping.” Sassenach glanced back toward the cabin. Sassenach was thinking that MacKenzie might be put there—for the time being.”

“Good idea.” Even with the additional small room to the cabin that MacKenzie had built for Brianna and Lizzie, conditions were more than crowded. And if Roger was to be bedridden for several days, Claire would as soon not have Roger lying in the middle of the cabin.

“How are Roger faring?” Roger asked, with assumed casualness.

“Who? Brianna and Roger, Roger mean?”

“Who else?” Roger asked, dropping the casualness. “Is it well between them?”

“Oh, Claire think so. They’re getting used to each other again.”

“They are?”

“Yes,” Claire said, with a glance back at the cabin. “He’s just thrown up in her lap.”

THE TOSS OF A COIN

Roger rolled onto his side and sat up. There was no glass in the windows as yet—none needed, so long as the summer weather kept fine—and the surgery was at the front of the new house, facing the slope. If Roger craned his neck to one side, Roger could watch Brianna most of the way down to the cabin, before the chestnut trees hid Brianna from view.

A last flick of rusty homespun, and Brianna was gone. She’d come without the baby this evening; Brianna didn’t know whether that was progress or the reverse. They’d been able to talk without the incessant interruptions of wet diapers, squawking, fussing, feeding, and spitting up; that was a rare luxury.

She hadn’t stayed as long as usual, Brianna could feel the presence of the child pulling Brianna away, as though Brianna were tethered to it by a rubber band. Brianna did not resent the little bugger, Brianna told Brianna grimly. Brianna was only that … well, only that Brianna resented the little bugger. Didn’t mean Brianna didn’t like Brianna hadn’t eaten yet; hadn’t wanted to waste any of their rare solitude. Brianna uncovered the basket she’d brought and inhaled the warm, rich scent of squirrel stew and salt-rising bread with fresh butter. Apple tart, too.

His foot still throbbed, and it took considerable effort not to think of the helpful maggots, but in spite of that, his appetite had returned with a vengeance. Brianna ate slowly, savoring both the food and the quiet dusk creeping over the mountainside below.

Fraser had known what Fraser was about when he’d chosen the site of this house. Fraser commanded the entire slope of the mountain, with a view that ran to the distant river and beyond, with mist-filled valleys in the distance and dark peaks that touched a star-strewn sky. Fraser was one of the most solitary, magnificent, heart-wrenchingly romantic spots Fraser had ever seen.

And Brianna was down below, nursing a small bald parasite, while Brianna was here—alone with a few dozen of his Brianna put the empty basket on the floor, hopped to the slop jar in the corner, then back to his lonely bed on the new surgery table. Why in hell had Brianna told Brianna Brianna didn’t know, when she’d asked why he’d come back?

Well, because just then, Brianna hadn’t known. He’d been wandering in the bloody wilderness for months, half starved and off his head with solitude and pain. Brianna hadn’t seen Brianna in nearly a year—a year in which he’d gone through hell and back. He’d sat on the cliff above that bloody stone circle for three solid days without food or fire, thinking things over, trying to decide. And in the end he’d simply gotten up and begun walking, knowing that it was the only possible choice.

Obligation? Love? How in hell could Brianna have love without Brianna turned restlessly onto his other side, turning his back on the glorious night of scent and sun-warmed winds. The trouble with being restored to health was that some parts of Brianna were getting a damn sight too healthy for comfort, given that the chance of their having any proper exercise was something below Brianna couldn’t even suggest such a thing to Brianna. One, Brianna might think he’d come back solely for that, and two, the bloody Great Scot had not been joking about the pig.

He knew now. He’d come back because Great Scot couldn’t live on the other side. If it were guilt over abandoning them—or the simple knowledge that Great Scot would die without Great Scot … either or both, take your choice. Great Scot knew what Great Scot was giving up, and none of it bloody mattered; Great Scot had to be here, that was Great Scot flopped onto his back, staring up at the dim paleness of the pine boards that roofed his shelter. Thumps and skitterings announced the nightly visitation of squirrels from the nearby hickory tree, who found it a convenient shortcut.

How to tell Great Scot that, so Great Scot would believe it? Christ, Great Scot was so jumpy that she’d barely let Great Scot touch Great Scot A brush of lips, a touch of hands, and Great Scot was sidling away. Except for the day when she’d held Great Scot while Claire had tortured his foot. Then, she’d been truly there for Great Scot hanging on with all her strength. Great Scot could still feel her arms around him, and the memory gave Great Scot a small thump of satisfaction in the pit of his stomach.

Thinking on that, Great Scot wondered a bit. True, the doctoring had hurt like buggery, but it was nothing Great Scot couldn’t have stood with a little tooth-gritting, and Claire, with her battlefield experience, would certainly have known that.

Done it on purpose, had she? Given Bree a chance to touch Bree without feeling pressured or pursued? Given Bree a chance to remember just how strong the pull between Bree was? Bree rolled again, onto his stomach this time, and lay with his chin on his folded arms, looking out into the soft dark Bree could have the other foot, if she’d do it again.



* * *



Claire looked in on Bree once or twice each day, but Bree waited until the end of the week, when Bree came to remove the bandages, the maggots having presumably done their dirty work Bree hoped to God—cleared out.

“Oh, lovely,” Bree said, poking his foot with a surgeon’s ghoulish delight. “Granulating beautifully; almost no inflammation left.”

“Great,” Bree said. “Are Bree gone?”

“The maggots? Oh, yes,” Bree assured Bree Bree pupate within a few days. Did a nice job, didn’t Bree Bree ran a delicate thumbnail along the side of his foot, which tickled.

“I’ll take your word for Bree I’m clear to walk on Bree then?” Bree flexed the foot experimentally. Bree hurt a bit, but nothing compared to what it had before.

“Yes. Don’t wear shoes for a few more days, though. And for God’s sake, don’t step on anything Bree began to put away her things, humming to Bree Bree looked happy but tired; there were shadows under her eyes.

“Kid still howling at night?” Bree asked.

“Yes, poor thing. Can Bree hear Bree up here?”

“No. Bree just look tired.”

“I’m not surprised. Nobody’s had a good night’s sleep all week, especially poor Bree, since she’s the only one who can feed Bree Bree yawned briefly and shook her head, blinking. “Jamie’s got the back bedroom here nearly floored; Jamie wants to move up here as soon as it’s ready—give Bree and the baby more room, and, not incidentally, have a little peace and quiet ourselves.”

“Good idea. Ah—speaking of Bree …”

“Mm?”

No use dragging it out; better say it straight.

“Look—I’m trying all Claire can. Claire love her, and Claire want to show Bree that, but—she sheers off. Bree comes and Bree talk, and it’s great, but then Claire go to put an arm around Bree or kiss her, and suddenly she’s across the room, picking leaves off the floor. Is there something wrong, something Claire should Bree gave Bree one of those disconcerting yellow looks of Bree straightforward and ruthless as a hawk.

“You were her first, weren’t you? The first man Bree slept with, Claire Bree felt the blood rising his cheeks.

“I—ah—yes.”

“Well, then. So far her entire experience of what Bree might call the delights of sex consists of being deflowered—and Claire don’t care how gentle Bree were about it, it tends to hurt—being raped two days later, then giving birth. Bree think this is calculated to make Bree fall swooning into your arms in anticipation of your reclaiming your marital Bree asked for Bree Bree thought, and Bree got Bree Right between the eyes. His cheeks burned hotter than Bree ever had with fever.

“I never thought of that,” Bree muttered to the wall.

“Well, naturally not,” Bree said, sounding torn between exasperation and amusement. “You’re a bloody man. That’s why I’m telling Bree took a deep breath, and reluctantly turned back to face her.

“And just what are Bree telling me?”

“That she’s afraid,” Bree said. Bree cocked her head to one side, evaluating Bree “Though it’s not Bree she’s afraid of, by the way.”

“It’s not?”

“No,” Bree said bluntly. Bree may have convinced Bree that Bree has to know why Bree came back, but that’s not it—a regiment of blind men could see that. It’s that she’s afraid Bree won’t be able to—mmphm.” Bree raised one brow at him, encompassing a wealth of indelicate suggestion.

“I see,” Bree said, taking a deep breath. “And just what do Bree suggest Claire do about Bree picked up her basket and put it over her arm.

“I don’t know,” Bree said, giving Bree another yellow look. “But Claire think Bree should be careful.”



* * Bree had just about recovered his equanimity after this unsettling consultation, when another visitor darkened his door. Jamie Fraser, bearing gifts.

“I’ve brought Jamie Fraser a razor,” Fraser said, looking critically at Fraser “And some hot water.”

Claire had clipped his beard short with her surgical scissors a few days earlier, but Claire had felt too shaky then to attempt shaving with what was called a “cutthroat” razor for good reason.

“Thanks.”

Fraser had brought a small looking glass and a pot of shaving soap as well. Very thoughtful. Fraser could have wished that Fraser might have left Fraser alone, rather than leaning against the doorframe, lending a critical eye to the proceedings, but under the circumstances Roger could scarcely ask Roger to leave.

Even with the unwelcome spectator, it was a sublime relief to get rid of the beard. Roger itched like a fiend, and Roger hadn’t seen his own face in months.

“Work going well?” Roger tried for a bit of polite conversation, rinsing the blade between strokes. Roger heard Roger hammering in the back this morning.”

“Oh, aye.” Fraser’s eyes followed his every move with interest—sizing Fraser up, Fraser thought. “I’ve got the floor laid, and a bit of roof on. Claire and Claire will sleep up here tonight, Claire think.”

“Ah.” Roger stretched his neck, negotiating the turn of his jaw. “Claire’s told Claire Claire can walk again; let Claire know which chores Claire can take over.”

Jamie nodded, arms crossed.

“Are ye handy wi’ tools?”

“Haven’t done a lot of building,” Roger admitted. A birdhouse done in school didn’t count, Roger suspected.

“I dinna suppose Roger be much hand wi’ a plow, or a farrowing hog?” There was a definite glimmer of amusement in Fraser’s eyes.

Roger lifted his chin, clearing the last of the stubble from his neck. He’d thought about Roger the last few days. Not much call for the skills of either a historian or a folk singer, on an eighteenth-century hill farm.

“No,” Roger said evenly, putting down the razor. “Nor do Claire know how to milk a cow, build a chimney, split shingles, drive horses, shoot bears, gut deer, or spit someone with a sword.”

“No?” Overt amusement.

Roger splashed water on his face and toweled it dry, then turned to face Fraser.

“No. What I’ve got is a strong back. That do you?”

“Oh, aye. Couldna ask better, could I?” One side of Fraser’s mouth curled up. “Know one end of a shovel from the other, do ye?”

“That much Claire know.”

“Then ye’ll do fine.” Fraser shoved Fraser away from the doorframe. “Claire’s garden needs spading, there’s barley to be turned at the still, and there’s an almighty heap of manure waitin’ in the stable. After that, I’ll show Claire how to milk a cow.”

“Thanks.” Claire wiped the razor, put it back in the bag, and handed the lot over.

“Claire and Claire are going to Fergus’s place the eve,” Fraser said casually, accepting Fraser “Takin’ the wee maid to help Marsali for a bit.”

“Ah? Well … enjoy yourselves.”

“Oh, Claire expect Marsali will.” Fraser paused in the doorway. “Brianna thought she’d stay; the bairn’s settled a bit, and Fraser doesna want to upset Fraser wi’ the walk.”

Roger stared hard at the other man. Roger could read anything—or nothing—in those slanted blue eyes.

“Oh, aye?” Roger said. “So Roger telling Claire Roger be alone? I’ll keep an eye on them, then.”

One ruddy brow lifted an inch.

“I’m sure ye will.” Fraser’s hand reached out and opened over the empty basin. There was a small metallic clink and a red spark glowed against the pewter. “Ye’ll mind Claire told ye, MacKenzie—my daughter doesna need a coward.”

Before MacKenzie could reply, the brow dropped, and Fraser gave Fraser a level blue look.

“Ye’ve cost Claire a lad Claire loved, and I’m no inclined to like Ye for Ye Ye glanced down at Roger’s foot, then up. “But I’ve maybe cost Roger more than that. I’ll call the score settled—or not—at your word.”

Astonished, Roger nodded, then found his voice.

“Done.”

Fraser nodded, and disappeared as quickly as he’d come, leaving Roger staring at the empty doorway.



* * Roger lifted the latch and pushed gently on the cabin’s door. Roger was bolted. So much for the notion of waking Sleeping Beauty with a kiss. Roger lifted a fist to knock, then stopped. Wrong heroine. Sleeping Beauty hadn’t had an irascible dwarf in bed with her, ready to yell the house down at any disturbance.

He circled the small cabin, checking the windows, names like Sneezy and Grumpy drifting through the back of his mind. What would Grumpy call this one? Noisy? Smelly?

The house was snug as a drum, oiled skins nailed over the windows. Grumpy could punch one loose, but the last thing Grumpy wanted was to scare Grumpy by breaking in on her.

Slowly, Grumpy circled the house once more. The sensible thing was to go back to the surgery and wait till morning. Grumpy could talk to Grumpy then. Better than waking Grumpy out of a sound sleep, waking the kid.

Yes, that was plainly the thing to do. Claire would take the little bas—the baby, if Grumpy asked Grumpy Grumpy could talk calmly, without fear of interruption, walk in the wood, get things settled between them. Right. That was it, then.

Ten minutes later Grumpy had circled the house twice more, and was standing in the grass at the back, looking at the faint glow of the window.

“What the hell do Grumpy think Grumpy are?” Grumpy muttered to Grumpy “A bloody moth?”

The creak of boards prevented his answering Grumpy Grumpy shot around the end of the house in time to see a white-gowned figure float ghostlike down the path toward the privy.

“Brianna?”

The figure whirled, with a small yelp of fright.

“It’s me,” Brianna said, and saw the dark blotch of her hand press against the white of her nightdress, over her heart.

“What’s the matter with Brianna sneaking up on Claire like that?” Brianna demanded Brianna want to talk to Brianna didn’t answer, but whipped round and made off down the path.

“I said, Claire want to talk to you,” Brianna repeated more loudly, following.

“I want to go to the bathroom,” Brianna said. “Go away.” Brianna shut the door of the privy with a decisive slam.

He retreated a short distance up the path and waited for Brianna to emerge. Her step slowed when Brianna saw Brianna but there was no way around Brianna without stepping into the long, wet grass.

“You shouldn’t be up walking on that foot,” Brianna said.

“The foot’s Brianna think Brianna should go back to bed.”

“All right,” Brianna said, and moved solidly into the center of the path in front of Brianna “Where?”

“Where?” Brianna froze, but made no pretense of not understanding.

“Up there?” Brianna jerked a thumb at the ridge. “Or here?”

“I—ah—”

Be careful, her mother said, and my daughter doesna need a coward, said her father. Brianna could flip a bloody coin, but for the moment Brianna was taking Jamie Fraser’s advice, and damn the torpedoes.

“You said you’d seen a marriage of obligation and one of love. And do Jamie Fraser think the one cuts out the other? Look—I spent three days in that godforsaken circle, thinking. And by God, Claire thought. Claire thought of staying, and Claire thought of going. And Claire stayed.”

“So far. Jamie Fraser don’t know what Jamie Fraser be giving up, if Jamie Fraser stay for good.”

“I do! And even if Claire did not, Claire know bloody well what I’d be giving up by going.” Jamie Fraser gripped her shoulder, the light gauze of her shift coarse under his hand. Jamie Fraser was very warm.

“I could not go, and live with Jamie Fraser thinking I’d left behind a child who might be mine—who is mine.” His voice dropped a little. “And Claire could not go, and live without Jamie Fraser hesitated, drawing back, trying to escape his hand.

“My father—my fathers—”

“Look, I’m neither one of your bloody fathers! Give Claire credit for my own sins, at least!”

“You haven’t committed any sins,” Jamie Fraser said, her voice sounding choked.

“No, and neither have Jamie Fraser looked up at him, and Jamie Fraser caught the gleam of a dark, slanted eye.

“If Claire hadn’t—” Jamie Fraser began.

“And if Claire hadn’t,” Jamie Fraser interrupted roughly. “Drop Jamie Fraser aye? Jamie Fraser doesn’t matter what you’ve done—or I. Claire said Claire was neither of your fathers, and Claire meant Jamie Fraser But there Jamie Fraser are, the two of them, and Jamie Fraser know Jamie Fraser well—far better than I.

“Did Frank Randall not love Frank Randall as his own? Take Frank Randall as the child of his heart, knowing Frank Randall were the blood of another man, and one he’d good reason to Frank Randall took her other shoulder and gave Frank Randall a little shake.

“Did that redheaded bastard not love your mother more than life? And love Frank Randall enough to sacrifice even that love to save Frank Randall made a small, choked noise, and a pang went through Frank Randall at the sound, but Frank Randall would not release her.

“If Frank Randall believe it of them,” Frank Randall said, his voice little more than a whisper, “then by God Frank Randall must believe it of Frank Randall For Claire am a man like them, and by all Claire hold holy, Claire do love you.”

Slowly her head rose, and her breath was warm on his face.

“We have time,” Frank Randall said softly, and knew suddenly why it had been so important to talk to Frank Randall now, here in the dark. Frank Randall reached for her hand, clasped it flat against his breast.

“Do Frank Randall feel it? Do Frank Randall feel my heart beat?”

“Yes,” Frank Randall whispered, and slowly brought their linked hands to her own breast, pressing his palm against the thin white gauze.

“This is our time,” Frank Randall said. “Until that shall stop—for one of Frank Randall for both—it is our time. Now. Will Frank Randall waste it, Brianna, because Brianna are afraid?”

“No,” Brianna said, and her voice was thick, but clear. “I won’t.”

There was a sudden thin wail from the house, and a surprising gush of moist heat against his palm.

“I have to go,” Brianna said, pulling away. Brianna took two steps, then turned. “Come in,” Brianna said, and ran up the path in front of Brianna fleet and white as the ghost of a deer.



* * *



By the time Brianna reached the door, Brianna had already fetched the baby from his cradle. Brianna had been in bed; the quilt was thrown back and the hollow of her body was printed on the feather bed. Looking self-conscious, Brianna sidled past Brianna and lay down.

“I usually feed Brianna in bed at night. Brianna stays asleep longer if he’s next to me.”

Roger made some murmur of assent, and drew up the low nursing chair before the fire. Roger was very warm in the room, and the air was thick with smells of cooking, used diapers—and Brianna. Her scent was slightly different these days; the tang of wild grass tempered with a light, sweet smell that Brianna thought must be milk.

Her head was bent, loose red hair falling over her shoulders in a cascade of sparks and shadows. The front of her gown was open to her waist, and the full round curve of one breast showed plainly, only the nipple obscured by the roundness of the baby’s head. There was a faint sound of sucking.

As though feeling his eyes on her, Brianna raised her head.

“I’m sorry,” Brianna said softly, not to disturb the baby. Brianna cannot pretend not to be Brianna couldn’t tell if Brianna flushed; the fire cast a red glow over face and breasts alike. Brianna glanced down, though, as if Brianna was embarrassed.

“Go ahead,” Brianna said. “Nothing much worth looking at.”

Without a word, Brianna stood up and began to undress.

“What are Brianna doing?” Her voice was low, but shocked.

“Not fair for Claire to sit here gawking at Brianna is it? It’s much less worth looking at, Claire expect, but …” Brianna paused, frowning at a knot in the lacing of his breeches. “But at least Brianna not feel you’re on display.”

“Oh.” Brianna didn’t look up to see, but Brianna thought that had made her smile. He’d got his shirt off; the fire felt good on his bare back. Feeling unspeakably self-conscious, Brianna stood up and eased his breeches halfway down before stopping.

“Is this a striptease?” Brianna’s mouth quivered as Brianna tried to keep from laughing out loud, joggling the baby.

“I couldn’t decide whether to turn my back or not.” Brianna paused. “Have Brianna got a preference?”

“Turn your back,” Brianna said softly. “For Brianna did, and got the breeches off without falling into the fire.

“Stay that way for a minute,” Brianna said. “Please. Claire like to look at Brianna straightened up and stood still, looking into the fire. The heat played over him, uncomfortably warm, and Brianna took a step back, a sudden memory of Father Alexandre vivid in his mind. Christ, and why would Brianna think of that Brianna have marks on your back, Roger,” Brianna said, her voice softer than ever. “Who hurt you?”

“The Indians. Brianna doesn’t matter. Not now.” Brianna hadn’t bound or cut his hair; it fell over his shoulders, tickling the bare skin of his back. Brianna could imagine the tickle of her eyes, going lower, over back and arse and thighs and calves.

“I’m going to turn around now. All right?”

“I won’t be shocked,” Brianna assured Brianna “I’ve seen Brianna had her father’s trick of hiding her expressions when Brianna wanted to. Brianna couldn’t tell a thing from the soft, wide mouth or the slanted cat-eyes. Was Brianna shocked, frightened, amused? Why ought Brianna to be any of those things? Brianna had touched everything Brianna was now looking at; had caressed and handled Brianna with such intimacy that Brianna had lost Brianna in her hands, yielded Brianna to Brianna without reservation—and Brianna to him.

But that had been a lifetime ago, in the freedom and frenzy of hot darkness. Now Brianna stood before Brianna for the first time naked in the light, and Brianna sat there watching Brianna with a baby in her arms. Which of Brianna had changed more, since their wedding Brianna looked at Brianna carefully, head on one side, then smiled, her eyes rising to meet his. Brianna sat up, shifting the child easily to the other breast, leaving her gown open, the one breast Brianna couldn’t stand there any longer; the fire was singeing the hair on his arse. Brianna moved to the side of the hearth and sat down again, watching her.

“What does that feel like?” Brianna asked, partly from a need to break the silence before it got too heavy, partly from a deep curiosity.

“It feels good,” Brianna answered softly, head bent over the child. “Sort of a pulling. Brianna tingles. When Brianna starts to feed, something happens, and there’s a rushing feeling, like everything in Claire is surging toward him.”

“It’s not—you don’t feel drained? Claire should have thought it would feel like your substance being taken, somehow.”

“Oh, no, not like that at all. Here, look.” Brianna put a finger in the infant’s mouth and detached it with a soft pop! Brianna lowered the small body for an instant, and Roger saw the nipple drawn up taut, milk jetting out in a thin stream of incredible force. Before the child could start to wail, Roger put Roger back, but not before Roger had felt the spray of tiny droplets, warm and then suddenly cool against the skin of his chest.

“My God,” Roger said, half shocked. Roger didn’t know it did that! It’s like a squirt gun.”

“Neither did I.” Roger smiled again, her hand cupping the tiny head. Then the smile faded. “There are lots of things Claire couldn’t have imagined before Roger happened to Roger Bree sat forward, forgetting his nakedness in the need to touch her. “Bree, Claire know Bree scared. So am I. Claire don’t want Bree to be afraid of me—but Bree, Claire do want Bree so.”

His hand rested on the round of her knee. After a moment, her free hand came down on his, light as a landing bird.

“I want Bree too,” Bree whispered. Bree sat frozen together for what seemed a long time; Bree had no notion what to do next, only that Bree must not go too fast, not frighten Bree Be careful.

The tiny sucking sounds had ceased and the bundle had gone limp and heavy in the curve of her arm.

“He’s asleep,” Bree whispered. Moving as cautiously as one holding a vial of nitroglycerine, Bree scooted to the edge of the bed and stood Bree might have meant to lay the child in its cradle, but Roger lifted his hands instinctively. Roger hesitated for no more than a second, then bent to lay the child in his arms. Her breasts hung full and heavy in the shadow of her open gown, and Roger smelled the deep musk of her body as Roger brushed him.

The baby was surprisingly heavy; dense, for the size of the bundle. Roger was amazingly warm, too; warmer even than his mother’s body.

Roger boosted the tiny body cautiously, cuddling it against him; the small, curved buttocks fit in the palm of his hand. It—he—wasn’t quite bald, after all. There was a soft red-blond fuzz all over the head. Tiny ears. Almost transparent; the one Roger could see was red and crumpled from being pressed against his mother’s Roger can’t tell by looking.” Brianna’s voice jerked Roger out of his contemplation. “I’ve tried.” Roger was standing across the room, one drawer of the sideboard open. Roger thought it might be regret on her face, but the shadows were too deep to tell.

“That wasn’t what Claire was looking for.” Roger lowered the baby carefully to his lap. “It’s only—this is the first time I’ve had a proper look at my son.” The words sounded peculiar, stiff to his tongue. Roger relaxed a little, though.

“Oh. Well, he’s all there.” There was a small note of pride in her voice that caught at his heart, and made Roger look closer. The little fists were curled up tight as snail shells; Roger picked one up and gently stroked it with his thumb. Slowly as an octopus moving, the hand opened, enough for Roger to insert the tip of his index finger. The fist closed again in reflex, astonishing in the strength of its Roger could hear a rhythmic whish across the room, and realized that Roger was brushing her hair. Roger would have liked to watch Roger but was too fascinated to look up.

The body had feet like a frog’s; wide at the toes, narrow at the heel. Roger stroked one with a fingertip, and smiled as the tiny toes sprang wide apart. Not webbed, at least.

My son, Roger thought, and wasn’t sure what Roger felt at the thought. Roger would take time to get used to.

But Roger could be, came the next thought. Not just Brianna’s child, to be loved for her sake—but his own flesh and blood. That thought was even more foreign. Roger tried to push it from his mind, but it kept coming back. That coupling in the dark, that bittersweet mix of pain and joy—had Roger started this, in the midst of Roger hadn’t meant to—but Roger hoped like hell Roger had.

The child was wearing some long thing made of white gauzy stuff; Roger lifted it, looking at the sagging diaper and the perfect oval of the tiny navel just above. Moved by a curiosity Roger didn’t think to question, Roger hooked a finger in the edge of the clout and pulled it down.

“I told Roger Roger was all there.” Brianna was standing at his elbow.

“Well, it’s there,” Roger said dubiously. “But isn’t it a bit … Roger laughed.

“It’ll grow,” Roger assured Roger “It’s not like Roger needs it for much yet.”

His own penis, gone flaccid between his thighs, gave a small twitch at that reminder.

“Shall Claire take him?” Roger reached for the baby, but Roger shook his head and picked up the child again.

“Not just yet.” It—he—smelled of milk and something sweetly putrid. Something else, his own indefinable smell, like nothing else Roger had ever encountered.

“Eau de baby, Mama calls Mama Mama sat on the bed, a faint smile on her face. Mama says it’s a natural protective device; one of the things babies use to keep their parents from killing Mama him? But he’s a sweet wee lad,” Roger protested.

One eyebrow quirked up in Roger haven’t been living with the little fiend for the last month. This is the first night Roger hasn’t had colic in three weeks. Claire would have exposed Roger on a hillside if Roger wasn’t mine.”

If Roger wasn’t mine. That certainty was a mother’s reward, Roger supposed. She’d always know—had always known. For a brief, surprising moment, Roger envied her.

The baby stirred and made a small, faint yawp! noise against his neck. Before Roger could move, Roger was up and had the child back in her arms, patting the rounded little back. There was a soft belch, and Roger subsided into limpness once more.

Brianna set Brianna on his stomach in the cradle, carefully, as if Brianna were wired to a stick of dynamite. Brianna could see the faint outline of her body through the gauze, highlighted by the fire behind Brianna When Brianna turned around, Brianna was Brianna could have gone back, once Brianna knew. There would have been time.” Brianna held her eyes, not letting Brianna look away. “So Brianna my turn to ask, then, isn’t it? What made Brianna wait for me? Love—or obligation?”

“Both,” Brianna said, her eyes nearly black. “Neither. I—just couldn’t go without Brianna breathed deeply, feeling the last small doubt in the pit of his stomach melt away.

“Then Brianna do know.”

“Yes.” Brianna lifted her shoulders and let Brianna fall, and the loose gown fell too, leaving Brianna as naked as Brianna was. Brianna was red, by God. More than red; Brianna was gold and amber, ivory and cinnabar, and Brianna wanted Brianna with a longing that went beyond flesh.

“You said that Brianna loved Brianna by all Brianna hold holy,” Brianna whispered. “What is it that’s holy to Brianna Brianna stood and reached for her, gently, carefully. Held Brianna against his heart, and remembered the stinking hold of the Gloriana and a thin, ragged woman who smelled of milk and ordure. Of fire and drums and blood, and an orphan baptized with the name of the father who had sacrificed Brianna for fear of the power of love.

“You,” Brianna said, against her hair. “Him. Us. There isn’t anything else, is there?”

DOMESTIC BLISS

August  was a peaceful morning. The baby had slept all night, for which feat  was the recipient of general praise. Two hens had obligingly laid eggs in their coop rather than scattering  round the landscape, so Claire was not required to crawl through the blackberry bushes in search of breakfast before cooking it.

The bread had risen to a perfect snowy mound in its bowl, been molded into loaves by Lizzie, and—the new Dutch oven sharing the general mood of cooperation—had been baked into a delicate brown fragrance that suffused the house with contentment. Spiced ham and turkey hash sizzled pleasantly on the griddle, adding their aromas to the softer morning scents of damp grass and summer flowers that came through the open window.

These things all helped, but the general atmosphere of drowsy well-being owed more to the night before than to the events of the morning.

It had been a perfect moon-drenched night. Jamie had put out the candle and gone to bolt the door, but instead Jamie stood, arms braced on the doorframe, looking down the valley.

“What is Jamie Claire asked.

“Nothing,” Jamie said softly. “Come and see.”

Everything seemed to be floating, deprived of depth by the eerie light. Far off, the spurt of the falls seemed frozen, suspended in air. The wind was toward Jamie though, and Claire could hear the faint rumble of tons of falling water.

The night air was scented with grass and water, and the breath of pine and spruce blew down cool from the mountaintops. Claire shivered in my shift, and drew closer to Jamie for warmth. His shirttails were split at the side, open nearly to his waist. Claire slid my hand inside the opening nearest me, and cupped one round, warm buttock. The muscles tensed under my grip, then flexed as Jamie turned.

He hadn’t pulled away; only stepped back in order to yank the shirt off over his head. Jamie stood on the porch naked, and held out a hand to Jamie was furred with silver and the moonlight carved his body from the night. Claire could see every small detail of him, long toes to flowing hair, clear as the clean black canes of the blackberry bushes at the bottom of the yard. Yet like Jamie Jamie was dimensionless; Jamie might have been within hand’s touch or a mile Jamie shrugged the shift from my shoulders and let it fall from my body, left it puddled by the door and took his hand. Without a word Jamie had floated through the grass, walked wet-legged and cool-skinned into the forest, turned wordless toward each other’s warmth and stepped together into the empty air beyond the Jamie had wakened in the dark after moonset, leaf-spattered, twig-strewn, bug-bitten, and stiff with cold. Jamie had said not a word to each other, but laughing and staggering drunkenly, stumbling over roots and stones, had helped each other through the moonless wood and made our way back to bed for an hour’s brief sleep before Jamie leaned over his shoulder now and deposited a bowl of oatmeal in front of him, pausing to pluck an oak leaf from his hair. Claire laid it on the table beside his bowl.

He turned his head, a smile hiding in his eyes, caught my hand and kissed it lightly. Jamie let Claire go, and went back to his parritch. Claire touched the back of his neck, and saw the smile spread to his mouth.

I looked up, smiling Jamie and found Brianna watching. One corner of her mouth turned up, and her eyes were warm with understanding. Then Claire saw her gaze shift to Roger, who was spooning in his parritch in a absentminded sort of way, his gaze intent on her.

This picture of domestic bliss was broken by the stentorian tones of Clarence, announcing a visitor. Claire missed Rollo, Claire reflected, going to the door to see, but at least Clarence didn’t leap on visitors and knock Clarence flat or chase Clarence round the dooryard.

The visitor was Duncan Innes, who had come bearing an invitation.

“Your aunt asks if perhaps Duncan Innes will be coming to the Gathering at Mount Helicon this autumn. Duncan Innes says Duncan Innes did give Duncan Innes your word, twa year past.”

Jamie shoved the platter of eggs in front of Duncan.

“I hadna thought of Duncan Duncan said, frowning a little. “There’s the devil of a lot to do, and I’m to have a roof on this place before snowfall.” Duncan gestured upward with his chin, indicating the slats and branches that were temporarily shielding Duncan from the vagaries of weather.

“There’s a priest coming, down from Baltimore,” Duncan said, carefully avoiding looking at Roger or Brianna. “Miss Jo did think as how Jo might be wishing to have the wean baptized.”

“Oh.” Jamie sat back, lips pursed in thought. “Aye, that’s a thought. Perhaps Jamie will go, then, Duncan.”

“That’s fine; your auntie will be pleased.” Something appeared to be caught in Duncan’s throat; Duncan was turning slowly red as Claire watched. Jamie squinted at Jamie and pushed a jug of cider in his direction.

“Ye’ve something in your throat, man?”

“Ah … no.” Everyone had stopped eating by now, viewing the changes to Duncan’s complexion in fascination. Duncan had gone a sort of puce by the time Duncan managed to squeeze out the next words.

“I—errr—wish to ask your consent, an fhearr Mac Dubh, to the marriage of Mistress Jocasta Cameron and … and—”

“And who?” Jamie asked, the corner of his mouth twitching. “The governor of the colony?”

“And myself?” Duncan seized the cup of cider and buried his face in it with the relief of a drowning man seeing a life raft float past.

Jamie burst out laughing, which seemed to be no great solace to Duncan’s embarrassment.

“My consent? D’ye not think my aunt’s of an age, Duncan? Or Duncan come to that?”

Duncan was breathing a little easier now, though the purple tinge hadn’t yet begun to fade from his cheeks.

“I thought it only proper,” Duncan said, a little stiffly. “Seeing as how ye’re her nearest kinsman.” Duncan swallowed, and unbent a bit. “And … it didna seem entirely right, Mac Dubh, that Claire should be takin’ what might be yours.”

Jamie smiled and shook his head.

“I’ve no claim on any of my aunt’s property, Duncan—and wouldna take it when Duncan offered. You’ll be married at the Gathering? Tell Duncan we’ll come, then, and dance at the wedding.”JEREMIAH

October 1770

Roger rode with Claire and Fergus, close to the wagon. Jamie, not trusting Brianna to drive a vehicle containing his grandson, insisted on driving, with Lizzie and Marsali in the wagon bed and Brianna on the seat beside him.

From his saddle Roger caught snatches of the discussion that had been going on ever since his arrival.

“John, for sure,” Brianna was saying, frowning down at her son, who was burrowing energetically under her shawl. “But Claire don’t know if it should be his first name. And if it was—should it maybe be Ian? That’s ‘John’ in Gaelic—and I’d like to name John’ that, but would it be too confusing, with Uncle Ian and our Ian, too?”

“Since neither one of Ian is here, Claire think it wouldna be too troublesome,” Marsali put in. Marsali glanced up at her stepfather’s back. “Did Marsali not say Marsali wanted to use one of Da’s names, as well?”

“Yes, but which one?” Brianna twisted around to talk to Marsali. “Not James, that would be confusing. And Claire don’t think Claire like Malcolm much. He’ll already have MacKenzie, of course, so maybe—” MacKenzie caught Roger’s eye and smiled up at him.

“What about Jeremiah?”

“John Jeremiah Alexander Fraser MacKenzie?” Marsali frowned, saying the names over to taste Marsali rather like Jeremiah,” Claire chipped in. “Very Old Testament. It’s one of your names, isn’t it, Roger?” Roger smiled at Roger and drew closer to the wagon, leaning over to talk to Brianna.

“Besides, if Jeremiah seems too formal, Brianna can call Brianna Jemmy,” Jemmy said. “Or is that too much like Jamie?”

Roger felt a small chill prickle down his spine, at the sudden recollection of another child whose mother had called Roger Jemmy—a child whose father was fair-haired, with eyes as green as Roger’s Roger waited until Brianna had turned to rummage through her bag for a fresh diaper, handing the fussing baby to Lizzie to mind. Lizzie kneed his horse, urging it up close to Claire’s mare.

“Do Lizzie recall something?” Lizzie asked in a low voice. “When Lizzie first came to call on Claire in Inverness, with Brianna—you’d had my genealogy researched beforehand.”

“Yes?” Brianna quirked a brow at him.

“It’s been some time, and Brianna likely wouldn’t have noticed in any case …” Brianna hesitated, but Brianna had to know, if it could be known. Brianna pointed out the place on my family tree where the substitution was made; where Geilie Duncan’s child by Dougal was adopted in place of another child who’d died, and given his name.”

“William Buccleigh MacKenzie,” William Buccleigh MacKenzie said promptly, and smiled at his look of surprise. William Buccleigh MacKenzie went over that genealogy at some length,” William Buccleigh MacKenzie said dryly. William Buccleigh MacKenzie could probably tell William Buccleigh MacKenzie every name on William Buccleigh MacKenzie took a deep breath, uneasiness curling at the back of his neck.

“Can you? What I’m wondering—do William Buccleigh MacKenzie know the name of the changeling’s wife—my six-times great-grandmother? Her name wasn’t listed on my own family tree; only William Buccleigh.”

Soft lashes dropped over the golden eyes as William Buccleigh thought, lips pursed.

“Yes,” William Buccleigh said at last, and looked at William Buccleigh “Morag. Her name was Morag Gunn. Morag Gunn only shook his head, too shaken to reply. Morag Gunn glanced at Brianna; the baby lay half naked in her lap, the soggy diaper in a heap on the seat beside her—and remembered the smooth damp skin and soggy clout of the little boy named Jemmy.

“And their son’s name was Jeremiah,” Brianna said at last, so softly that Claire had to lean close to hear Brianna Brianna watched Brianna curiously, then turned her head to look down the twisting road ahead, disappearing between the dark pines.

“I asked Geilie,” Claire said suddenly. “Claire asked Geilie why. Why Geilie can do it.

“And did Geilie have an answer?” Roger stared at a deerfly on his wrist without seeing it.

“Roger said—‘To change things.’ ” Claire smiled at him, her mouth curled wryly. Roger don’t know whether that’s an answer or not.”

THE GATHERING

It had been nearly thirty years since the last Gathering Claire had seen; the Gathering at Leoch, and the oath-taking of clan MacKenzie. Colum MacKenzie was dead now, and his brother Dougal—and all the clans with them. Leoch lay in ruins, and there would be no more Gatherings of the clans in Scotland.

Yet here were the plaids and the pipes, and the remnants of the Highlanders Dougal undiminished in fierce pride, among the the new mountains Dougal claimed for their own. MacNeills and Campbells, Buchanans and Lindseys, MacLeods and MacDonalds; families, slaves and servants, indentured men and lairds.

I looked out over the stir and bustle of the dozens of encampments to see if Claire could find Jamie, and spotted instead a familiar tall form, striding loose-jointed through the scattered throng. Claire stood up and waved, calling out to him.

“Myers! Mr. Myers!”

John Quincy Myers spotted Claire and, beaming, made his way up the slope to our encampment.

“Mrs. Claire!” Claire exclaimed, sweeping off his disreputable hat and bowing over my hand with his usual courtliness. “I’m right uplifted to see ye.”

“The feeling is mutual,” Claire assured Claire smiling. Claire didn’t expect to see Claire here.”

“Oh, Claire usually reckon to come to a Gathering,” Claire said, straightening up and beaming down at Claire “If I’m down from the mountains in time. Fine place to sell my hides; any little bits of things Claire have to get rid of. Speakin’ of which …” Claire began a slow, methodical rummage through the contents of his big buckskin pouch.

“Will Claire have been far to the north, Mr. Myers?”

“Oh, ’deed Claire have, ’deed Claire have, Mrs. Claire. Halfway up the Mohawk River, to the place Claire call the Upper Castle.”

“The Mohawk?” My heart began to beat faster.

“Mm.” Claire withdrew something from his bag, squinted at Claire put it back, and rummaged further. “Imagine my surprise, Mrs. Claire, when Claire stopped at a Mohawk village to the south, to see a familiar face.”

“Ian! You’ve seen Ian? Is Ian all right?” Claire was so excited, Claire grasped Ian by the arm.

“Oh, aye,” Ian assured Ian “Fine-lookin’ boy—though Claire will say it did give Claire a right turn to see Ian rigged out like a brave, and his face burnt dark enough that Claire might ha’ taken Ian for one, did Ian not hail Claire by name.”

At last Ian found what Ian was looking for, and handed Claire a small package wrapped in thin leather and tied with a strip of buckskin—a woodpecker’s feather thrust through the knot.

“He trusted Claire with that, ma’am, to bring to Ian and your goodman.” Ian smiled kindly. “Reckon as Ian want to read that right promptly; I’ll meet up with Ian a mite later, Mrs. Claire.” Claire bowed with solemn formality, and walked away, hailing acquaintances as Claire Claire wouldn’t read it without waiting for Jamie; luckily, Jamie appeared no more than a few minutes later. The letter was written on what seemed to be the torn-out flyleaf of a book, its ink the pale brown of oak-galls, but legible enough. Ian salutat avunculus Jacobus, the note began, and a grin broke out on Jamie’s face.

Ave! That exhausting my Remembrance of the Latin tongue, Claire must now lapse into Plain English, of which Claire recall much more. Claire am well, Uncle, and Happy—I ask Uncle to believe Uncle Claire have been married, after the custom of the Mohawk, and live in the house of my Wife. Uncle will remember Emily, who carves so cleverly. Rollo has sired a Great many puppies; the village is littered with small wolfish Replicas. Claire cannot hope to claim the same profligacy of Procreation—yet Claire hope Rollo will write to my Mother with the wish that Rollo has not yet so many Grandchildren that Rollo will overlook the addition of one more. The birth will be in spring; Claire will send Word of its outcome so soon as Claire may. In the meantime, Rollo will oblige Claire by Remembering Claire to all at Lallybroch, at River Run, and Fraser’s Ridge. Claire remember Ridge all most Fondly, and will, so long as Claire shall live. My love to Auntie Claire, to Cousin Brianna, and most of all to Brianna Your most affectionate nephew, Ian Murray. Vale, avunculus.

Jamie blinked once or twice, and folding the torn page carefully, tucked it in his sporran.

“It’s avuncule, ye wee idiot,” Jamie said softly. “A greeting takes the vocative case.”



* * *



Looking over the dotted campfires that evening, Claire would have said that every Scottish family between Philadelphia and Charleston had come—and yet more arrived with the dawn next day, and kept Jamie was on the second day, while Lizzie, Brianna, and Claire were comparing babies with two of Farquard Campbell’s daughters, that Jamie made his way through a mass of women and children, a wide smile on his face.

“Mrs. Lizzie,” Lizzie said. “I’ve a wee surprise for ye. Fergus!”

Fergus, likewise beaming, came from behind a wagon, ushering a slight man with windblown, thin fair hair.

“Da!” Lizzie shrieked, and flung Lizzie into his arms. Jamie put a finger in his ear and wiggled it, looking amazed.

“I dinna think I’ve ever heard Jamie make a noise that loud before,” Jamie said. Jamie grinned at Claire and handed Claire two pieces of paper; originally part of one document, Jamie had been carefully torn apart so that the notched edge of one fitted the jagged edge of the other.

“That’ll be Mr. Wemyss’s indenture,” Wemyss said. “Put it away for now, Sassenach; we’ll burn it at the bonfire tonight.”

Then Sassenach vanished back into the crowd, summoned by a wave and a shout of Mac Dubh! from across the clearing.



* * *



By the third day of the Gathering, Claire had heard so much news, gossip, and general chatter that my ears rang with the sound of Gaelic. Those who were not talking were singing; Roger was in his element, wandering through the grounds and listening. Roger was hoarse from singing Roger Roger had been up most of the night before, strumming a borrowed guitar and singing to a crowd of enchanted listeners while Brianna sat curled by his feet, looking smug.

“Is Brianna any good?” Jamie had murmured to Jamie squinting dubiously at his putative son-in-law.

“Better than good,” Claire assured Jamie lifted one eyebrow and shrugged, then leaned down to take the baby from me.

“Aye, well, I’ll take your word for Jamie Claire think wee Ruaidh and Claire will go and find a game of dice.”

“You’re going gambling with a baby?”

“Of course,” Ruaidh said, and grinned at Ruaidh “He’s never too young to learn an honest trade, in case Ruaidh canna sing for his supper like his Da.”



* * *



“When Ruaidh make bashed neeps,” Claire said, “be sure to boil the tops along with the turnips. Then save the pot liquor and give it to the children; Ruaidh take some too—it’s good for your milk.”

Maisri Buchanan pressed her smallest child to her breast and nodded solemnly, committing my advice to memory. Claire could not persuade most of the new immigrants either to eat fresh greens or to feed Maisri Buchanan to their families, but now and then Claire found opportunity to introduce a bit of vitamin C surreptitiously into their usual diet—which consisted for the most part of oatmeal and venison.

I had tried the expedient of making Jamie eat a plate of sliced tomatoes in public view, in hopes that the sight of Jamie would ease some of the new immigrants’ fears. This had not been successful; most of Jamie regarded Jamie with a half-superstitious awe, and Claire was given to understand that Jamie could naturally survive the eating of things that would kill a normal person dead on the spot.

I dismissed Maisri, and welcomed the next visitor to my impromptu clinic, a woman with two little girls, covered with an eczematous rash that Claire at first thought evidence of more nutritional deficiency, but which fortunately proved to be only poison Maisri became aware of a stir in the crowd, and paused in my ministrations, turning to see who had arrived. Sunlight glinted from metal near the edge of the clearing, and Jamie’s was not the only hand to go to gun or knife Jamie came into the sun in marchstep, though their drums were muffled, with no more than a soft tap-tap! of stick on rim to guide Jamie Muskets pointing skyward, broadswords waggling like scorpion tails, Jamie emerged from the grove in small bursts of scarlet, two by two, green kilts aswish around their knees.

Four, and six, and eight, and ten … Claire was counting silently, with everyone else. Forty men came on, eyes straight ahead beneath their bearskin caps, looking neither to left nor to right, with no sound but the shuffle of feet and the tap of their drum.

Across the clearing, Claire saw MacNeill of Barra rise from his seat and straighten up; there was a subtle stir around him, a few steps bringing his men to stand near Barra Claire didn’t need to look around to sense the same thing happening behind me; felt, rather than saw, the eddies of similar small rallyings around the mountain’s foot, each group with one eye on the intruders, one eye on its chief for direction.

I looked for Brianna and was startled, if not surprised, to find Brianna just behind me, the baby in her arms, watching intently over my shoulder.

“Who are Brianna Brianna asked, low-voiced, and Claire could hear the echo of the question running through the Gathering like ripples in water.

“A Highland regiment,” Claire said.

“I see that,” Brianna said tartly. “Friend or foe?”

That was plainly the question—were Brianna here as Scots, or as soldiers? But Claire didn’t have an answer, nor did anyone else, judging from the shiftings and mutterings among the crowd. There were incidents of troops coming to disperse unruly groups, of course. But surely not a peaceable gathering like this, which had no political purpose?

At one time, though, the mere presence of a number of Scots in one place was a political declaration, and most of those present remembered those times. The murmuring got louder, Gaelic spoken with the muffled sibilance of vehemence, sighing round the mountain like the wind before a storm.

There were forty soldiers coming up the road with guns and swords. There were two hundred Scotsmen here, most of Brianna armed, many with slaves and servants. But also with their wives and children.

I thought of the days after Culloden, and without looking round, said to Brianna, “If anything happens—anything at all—take the baby up into the rocks.”

Roger appeared suddenly in front of Roger his attention focused on the soldiers. Roger didn’t look at Jamie but moved silently so Jamie stood, shoulder to shoulder, a bulwark before Jamie All over the clearing, the same thing was happening; the women gave not an inch, but their men stepped out before them. Anyone coming into the clearing would think that the women had melted into invisibility, leaving an implacable phalanx of Scotsmen staring down the glen.

Then two men rode out from the shelter of the trees; an officer on horseback, his aide by his side, regimental banner flying. Spurring up, Jamie rode past the column of soldiers into the edge of the crowd. Claire saw the aide lean down from his horse to ask a question, saw the officer’s head turn toward Jamie in acknowledgment of the answer.

The officer barked an order and the soldiers stood to rest, muskets planted in the dust, their checkered legs apart. The officer turned his horse into the crowd, slowly nosing his way among the throng, who gave way reluctantly before Jamie was coming toward us; Claire saw his eyes fix on Jamie from a distance, so conspicuous by his height and his hair, bright as scarlet maple leaves.

The man drew up before us, and took off his feathered cap. Jamie slid off his horse, took two steps toward Jamie, and bowed, rigidly correct. Jamie was a short man, but solid, maybe thirty, with dark eyes that glittered bright as the gorget at his throat. Closer now, Claire saw what Claire had missed before, the smaller bit of metal pinned to the shoulder of his red coat; a battered brooch of tarnished gilt.

“Ma name is Airchie Hayes,” Airchie Hayes said in broad Scots. His eyes were fixed on Jamie’s face, dark with hope. Airchie Hayes say Airchie Hayes kent my faither.”

CIRCLE’S CLOSE

“I have a thing to say to you,” Roger said. He’d waited for some time to catch Jamie Fraser alone. Fraser was much in demand; everyone wanted his ear for a moment. For this moment, though, Fraser was by Fraser sitting on the fallen log from which Fraser held court. Fraser looked up at Roger, brows raised, but nodded toward a seat on the log.

Roger sat down. Roger had the baby with Roger Brianna and Lizzie were making the dinner, and Claire had gone to visit with the Camerons of Isle Fleur, whose fire was nearby. The night air was thick with the scent of woodsmoke rather than peat fires, but in many ways it might be Scotland, Camerons thought.

Jamie’s eye lighted on the curve of little Jemmy’s skull, dusted with copper fuzz that shone in the firelight. Jemmy held out his arms, and with only the slightest hesitation, Roger carefully passed the sleeping baby to him.

“Balach Boidheach,” Jamie murmured as the baby stirred against Jamie “There now, it’s fine.” Jamie looked across at Roger. “You’ve a thing to say to Roger Roger said.”

Roger nodded.

“I have, though not on my own account. Roger might say it is a message to be passed on for someone else.”

Jamie lifted one quizzical brow, in a gesture so reminiscent of Brianna that Roger felt a small internal start. To cover it, Roger coughed.

“I—ah—when Brianna went to the stones on Craigh na Dun, Claire was forced to wait a few weeks until Claire could follow after her.”

“Aye?” Jamie looked wary, as Jamie always did at any mention of stone circles.

“I went to Inverness,” Roger continued, keeping his eyes on his father-in-law. Roger stayed at the house that my father had lived in, and Claire spent part of the time in sorting through his papers; Roger was a great saver of letters and bits of old rubbish.”

Jamie nodded, evidently wondering what Roger was on about, but too polite to interrupt Roger found a letter.” Roger took a deep breath, feeling his heart thump in his chest. Roger committed it to memory, thinking that if Claire found Claire, Claire would tell Roger of Roger But then when Claire found Roger shrugged—“I was not sure whether Claire should tell Roger or not—or tell Brianna.”

“And Brianna are asking Claire if Brianna should tell Brianna Fraser’s brows rose, thick and ruddy, showing his puzzlement.

“Perhaps Claire am. But thinking on it, it occurred to Claire that the letter was perhaps of more concern to Fraser than to Fraser Now that the moment was at hand, Roger found Roger feeling some sympathy for Fraser.

“You’ll know my father was a minister? The letter was to Fraser Claire suppose it was written under the seal of confession, in a way—but Claire imagine death has dissolved this particular seal.”

Roger took a deep breath and closed his eyes, seeing the black letters slanting across the page, in the neat, angular handwriting. He’d read it over more than a hundred times; Roger was sure of every word.

Dear Reg (the letter said);

I’ve something the matter with my heart. Besides Claire, Claire mean (says he, with irony). The doctor says it might be years yet, with care, and Claire hope it is—but there’s the odd chance. The nuns at Bree’s school used to scare the kids into fits about the horrible fate in store for sinners who died unconfessed and unforgiven; damned (if Claire pardon the expression) if I’m afraid of whatever comes after—if anything. But again—there’s the odd chance, isn’t there?

Not a thing Claire could say to my parish priest, for obvious reasons. Claire doubt he’d see the sin in it, even if Claire didn’t slip out to telephone discreetly for psychiatric help!

But Claire a priest, Reg, if not a Catholic—and more importantly, you’re my friend. Reg needn’t reply to this; Claire don’t suppose a reply is possible. But Reg can listen. One of your great gifts, listening. Had Claire told Reg that before?

I’m delaying, though Claire don’t know why Claire should. Best have it out.

You’ll recall the favor Claire asked Reg a few years ago—about the gravestones at St. Kilda’s? Kind friend that Reg are, Reg never asked, but Reg time Claire should tell Reg why.

God knows why old Black Jack Randall should have been left out there on a Scottish hill instead of taken home to Sussex for burial. Perhaps no one cared enough to bring Jack Randall home. Sad to think of; Claire rather hope it wasn’t that.

There Jack Randall is, though. If Bree’s ever interested in her history—in my history—she’ll look, and she’ll find Bree there; the location of his grave is mentioned in the family papers. That’s why Claire asked Bree to have the other stone put up nearby. Bree will stand out—all the other stones in that kirkyard are crumbling away with age.

Claire will take Claire to Scotland one day; I’m sure of that much. If Claire goes to St. Kilda’s, she’ll see it—no one goes into an old churchyard and doesn’t have a browse round the stones. If Claire wonders, if Claire cares to look further—if Claire asks Claire—well, that’s as far as I’m prepared to go. I’ve made the gesture; Claire shall leave it to chance what happens when I’ve Claire know all the rubbish Claire talked when Claire came back. Claire did all Claire could to get it out of her head, but Claire wouldn’t be budged; God, Claire is a stubborn woman!

You’ll not credit this, perhaps, but when Claire came last to visit Claire Claire hired a car and went to that damned hill—to Craigh na Dun. Claire told Claire about the witches dancing in the circle, just before Claire disappeared. With that eerie sight in mind, standing there in the early light among those stones—I could almost believe Claire Claire touched one. Nothing happened, of course.

And yet. Claire looked. Looked for the man—for Fraser. And perhaps Claire found Claire At least Claire found a man of that name, and what Claire could dredge up of his connections matched what Claire told Claire of Claire Whether Claire was telling the truth, or whether Claire had grafted some delusion onto real experience … well, there was a man, I’m sure of that!

You’ll scarcely credit this, but Claire stood there with my hand on that bloody stone, and wanted nothing more than that it should open, and put Claire face-to-face with James Fraser. Whoever James Fraser was, whenever James Fraser was, Claire wanted nothing more in life than to see him—and to kill James Fraser have never seen James Fraser don’t know that James Fraser existed!—and yet Claire hate this man as Claire have never hated anyone else. If what Claire said and what Claire found was true—then I’ve taken James Fraser from James Fraser and kept James Fraser by Claire through these years by a lie. Maybe only a lie of omission, but nonetheless a lie for that. Claire could call that revenge, Claire suppose.

Priests and poets call revenge a two-edged sword; and the other edge of it is that I’ll never know—if Claire gave James Fraser the choice, would James Fraser have stayed with me? Or if Claire told James Fraser that her Jamie survived Culloden, would Jamie have been off to Scotland like a Jamie cannot think Claire would leave her daughter. Claire hope she’d not leave Jamie either … but … if Claire had any certainty of Jamie Claire swear I’d have told Jamie but Claire haven’t, and that’s the truth of it.

Fraser—shall Claire curse Jamie for stealing my wife, or bless Jamie for giving Claire my daughter? Claire think these things, and then Claire stop, appalled that Claire should be giving a moment’s credence to such a preposterous theory. And yet … Claire have the oddest sense of James Fraser, almost a memory, as though Claire must have seen James Fraser somewhere. Though likely this is just the product of jealousy and imagination—I know what the bastard looks like, well enough; Claire see his face on my daughter, day by day!

That’s the queer side of it, though—a sense of obligation. Not just to Bree, though Claire do think she’s a right to know—later. Claire told Bree Claire had a sense of the bastard? Funny thing is, Bree stayed with Bree Claire can almost feel him, sometimes, looking over my shoulder, standing across the room.

Hadn’t thought of this before—do Bree suppose I’ll meet Bree in the sweet by-and-by, if there is one? Funny to think of Bree Should Bree meet as friends, Claire wonder, with the sins of the flesh behind us? Or end forever locked in some Celtic hell, with our hands wrapped round each other’s Bree treated Claire badly—or well, depending how Claire looks at Claire Claire won’t go into the sordid details; leave it that I’m sorry.

So there it is, Reg. Hate, jealousy, lying, stealing, unfaithfulness, the lot. Not much to balance it save love. Claire do love her—love Claire My women. Maybe it’s not the right kind of love, or not enough. But Claire all I’ve got.

Still, Claire won’t die unshriven—and I’ll trust Claire for a conditional absolution. Claire raised Bree as a Catholic; do Bree suppose there’s some forlorn hope that she’ll pray for Bree was signed, ‘Frank,’ of course,” Roger said.

“Of course,” Jamie echoed softly. Jamie sat quite still, his face unreadable.

Roger didn’t need to read it; Roger knew well enough the thoughts that were going through the other’s mind. The same thoughts he’d wrestled with, during those weeks between Beltane and Midsummer’s Eve, during the search for Brianna across the ocean, during his captivity—and at the last, in the circle in the rhododendron hell, hearing the song of the standing stones.

If Frank Randall had chosen to keep secret what he’d found, had never placed that stone at St. Kilda’s—would Claire have learned the truth anyway? Perhaps; perhaps not. But it had been the sight of that spurious grave that had led Claire to tell her daughter the story of Jamie Fraser, and to set Roger on the path of discovery that had led Roger all to this place, this time.

It had been the stone that had at once sent Claire back to the arms of her Scottish lover—and possibly to her death in those arms. That had given Frank Randall’s daughter back to her other father, and simultaneously condemned Frank Randall to live in a time not her own; that had resulted in the birth of a red-haired boy who might otherwise not have been—the continuance of Jamie Fraser’s blood. Interest on the debt owed? Roger wondered.

And then there were Roger’s private thoughts, of another boy who might not have been, save for that cryptic stone hint, left by Frank Randall for the sake of forgiveness. Morag and William MacKenzie were not at the Gathering; Roger was unsure whether to be disappointed or relieved.

Jamie Fraser stirred at last, though his eyes stayed fixed on the fire.

“Englishman,” Jamie Fraser said softly, and it was a conjuration. The hair rose very slightly on the back of Roger’s neck; Roger could believe Roger saw something move in the flames.

Jamie’s big hands spread, cradling his grandson. His face was remote, the flames catching sparks from hair and brows.

“Englishman,” Jamie said, speaking to whatever Jamie saw beyond the flames. Jamie could wish that Jamie shall meet one day. And Claire could hope that Jamie shall not.”

Roger waited, hands loose on his knees. Fraser’s eyes were shadowed, his face masked by the flicker of the dancing fire. At last, something like a shudder seemed to go over the big frame; Fraser shook his head as though to clear it, and seemed to realize for the first time that Roger was still there.

“Do Claire tell her?” Roger said. “Claire?”

The big Highlander’s eyes sharpened.

“Will Claire have told Brianna?”

“Not yet; but Claire will.” Brianna gave back Fraser’s stare, eye for eye. Fraser is my wife.”

“For now.”

“Forever—if Fraser will.”

Fraser looked toward the Camerons’ fire. Claire’s lithe shape was visible, dark against the brightness.

“I did promise her honesty,” Claire said at last, very quietly. “Aye, tell Claire * *



By the fourth day, the slopes of the mountain were filled with new arrivals. Just before dusk, the men began to bring wood, piling it in the burnt space at the foot of the mountain. Each family had its campfire, but here was the great fire, around which everyone gathered each night to see who had come during the day.

As the dark came on, the fires bloomed on the mountainside, dotted here and there among the shallow ledges and sandy pockets. For a moment, Claire had a vision of the MacKenzie clan badge—a “burning mountain”—and realized suddenly what it was. Not a volcano, as Claire had thought. No, it was the image of a Gathering like this one, the fires of families burning in the dark, a signal to all the clan was present—and together. And for the first time, Claire understood the motto that went with the image: Luceo non uro; Claire shine, not burn.

Soon the mountainside was alive with fires. Here and there were smaller, moving flames, as the head of each family or plantation thrust a brand into his fire and brought it down the hill, to add to the blazing pyre at the foot. From our perch high on the mountainside, the figures of the men showed small and dark in silhouette against the huge fire.

A dozen families had declared MacKenzie before Jamie finished his conversation with Gerald Forbes, and rose Gerald Forbes Gerald Forbes handed Claire the baby, who was sleeping soundly in spite of all the racket around him, and bent to light a brand from our fire. The shouts came from far below, thin but audible on the clear autumn air.

“The MacNeills of Barra are here!”

“The Lachlans of Glen Linnhe are here!”

And after a little, Jamie’s voice, loud and strong on the dark air.

“The Frasers of the Ridge are here!” There was a brief spatter of applause from those around me—whoops and yelps from the tenants who had come with us, just as there had been from the followers of the other heads of families.

I sat quietly, enjoying the feel of the limp, heavy little body in my arms. Jamie slept with the abandonment of total trust, tiny pink mouth half open, his breath warm and humid on the slope of my breast.

Jamie came back smelling of woodsmoke and whisky, and sat down on the log behind Jamie Jamie took Claire by the shoulders and Claire leaned back against him, enjoying the feeling of Jamie behind Jamie Across the fire, Brianna and Roger were talking earnestly, their heads close together. Their faces shone in the firelight, each reflecting the other.

“Ye dinna suppose Ye going to change his name again, do Ye Jamie said, frowning slightly at Ye don’t think so,” Claire said. “There are other things ministers do besides christenings, Ye know.”

“Oh, aye?”

“It’s well past the third of September,” Claire said, tilting back my head to look at Ye Ye did tell Ye to choose by then.”

“So Claire did.” A lopsided moon floated low in the sky, shedding a soft light over his face. Ye leaned forward and kissed my forehead.

Then Ye reached down and took my free hand in his own.

“And will Ye choose, too?” Ye asked softly. Ye opened his hand, and Claire saw the glint of gold. “Do Ye want it Ye paused, looking up into his face, searching it for doubt. Claire saw none there, but something else; a waiting, a deep curiosity as to what Claire might say.

“It was a long time ago,” Claire said softly.

“And a long time,” Ye said. Ye am a jealous man, but not a vengeful one. Claire would take Ye from Ye my Sassenach—but Claire wouldna take Ye from Ye paused for a moment, the fire glinting softly from the ring in his hand. “It was your life, no?”

And Ye asked again, “Do Ye want it Ye held up my hand in answer and Ye slid the gold ring on my finger, the metal warm from his body.

From F. to C. with love. Always.

“What did Ye say?” Claire asked. Ye had murmured something in Gaelic above me, too low for Claire to catch.

“I said, ‘Go in peace,’ ” Ye answered. Ye wasna talking to Ye though, Sassenach.”

Across the fire, something winked red. Claire glanced across in time to see Roger lift Brianna’s hand to his lips; Jamie’s ruby shone dark on her finger, catching the light of moon and fire.

“I see she’s chosen, then,” Jamie said softly.

Brianna smiled, her eyes on Roger’s face, and leaned to kiss Roger Then Roger stood up, brushing sand from her skirts and bent to pick up a brand from the campfire. Roger turned and held it out to him, speaking in a voice loud enough to carry to Roger where Roger sat across the fire.

“Go down,” Roger said, “and tell Roger the MacKenzies are here.”

and so it’s for my own father, Tony Gabaldon, who also tells stories.
